7772375	A practical method for fission yeast transformation by electroporation.	High-voltage shock within a very short duration under the proper conditions causes cells to incorporate exogenous macromolecules. This technique, electroporation, has been widely used in recent years to transform many organisms. We determined optimum conditions for fission yeast transformation using this method. Of nineteen combinations of electric field strength and pulse time examined, 1.75 kV/0.2 cm, 4 msec pulse was found to provide approximately 4.0 x 10(5) transformants per micrograms of DNA. Other factors responsible for the transformation efficiency in fission yeast are also discussed.
7873174	An optimized electroporation protocol applicable to a wide range of cell lines.	A number of transfection methods for mammalian cells are available; however, many cell lines may appear resistant to efficient transfection, or at best, necessitate lengthy optimization procedures in recommended protocols. We describe here an electroporation protocol that yields highly efficient gene transfer (20%-100% of surviving cells) in all 19 cell lines tested so far, including lymphoid, myeloid, glial, fibroblast and COS cells. Unlike earlier electroporation protocols, adaptation of this protocol to a cell line of interest only requires the optimization of a single parameter, i.e., the voltage, and can be performed within a day. Furthermore, it is also superior to transfection protocols for other methods (calcium phosphate precipitation, lipofection, DEAE-dextran transfection and transferrinfection) in terms of reproducibility, economy and average transfection efficiency for a wide variety of cell lines.
8049351	Transformation of Escherichia coli with foreign DNA by electroporation.	Electroporation has been widely applied in molecular biology in recent years. In this study, successful transformation of plasmid DNA and transfection of phage DNA into E. coli were described by using intense electrical field of exponential decay waveform (electroporation) generated by a Gene Pulsar LN-101 (made in Tianjin, Tianjin Institute of Technology and Nankai University). We have obtained 10(9)-10(10) transformants/micrograms with strain DH5 alpha and plasmid pUC18, by a single voltage pulse at 1.0-2.5 kV (initial electric field strength = 2.8-16 kV/cm) with 5-20 microF capacitor. The efficiency of electroporation depends on various parameters: the electric field strength, capacitance, the pulse length (RC time constant), etc. The frequency of transformation was a linear function of the DNA concentration, as well as the density of recipient cell. The incubation time of before or after electroporation has no significant effect on transformation. The high transfection efficiency was also achieved with strain JM109 and M13mp19RF by electroporation. The method was easier, more time-saving and more efficient than Ca(2+)-dependent transformation (transfection) method. The results obtained by Gene-Pulsar LN-101 was similar to that by the Bio-Rad Gene-Pulsar apparatus.
8111026	Production of fertile transgenic maize by electroporation of suspension culture cells.	Fertile, transgenic maize plants were generated by electroporation of suspension culture cells that were treated with a pectin-degrading enzyme. Electroporation of cells from two different suspension cultures, one derived from A188 X B73 and one derived from a B73-related inbred, with a plasmid containing the bar gene, resulted in high-frequency recovery of stably transformed callus lines. Plants were regenerated from thirteen transformed callus lines and transmission of bar to progeny was demonstrated.
9663336	Preparation of red blood cells containing exogenous hemoglobin.	A technique is described for opening the membrane of a red blood cell by electroporation in a manner which permits free exchange of the native hemoglobin with exogenous hemoglobin in the surrounding medium. After resealing the RBC's demonstrate near normal size and hemoglobin content and retain an effective methemoglobin reduction system. This method can be used to introduce natural or genetically engineered hemoglobins with altered oxygen binding characteristics. Allosteric effectors and other non-diffusible small molecules can be encapsulated during the same procedure. A fish Root effect hemoglobin exchanged into rat RBC's produced oxygen transport characteristics, unloading at high pressure at acidic pH, which should be useful to treat tissue hypoxia from a variety of causes.
9734829	Theory of skin electroporation: implications of straight-through aqueous pathway segments that connect adjacent corneocytes.	"Previous in vitro experiments have shown that transdermal high-voltage pulses (Uskin approximately 100 V; duration approximately 1 ms) create local transport regions (LTR) away from appendages in human skin. Quantitative interpretation of the associated ionic and molecular transport led to the view that a large number of aqueous pathways were created, and these connect the corneocytes within an LTR. Here we use the ""brick wall"" model of the stratum corneum, modified so that morphology important to understanding electrical behavior is emphasized. In this model a minimum-size LTR is regarded as an idealized stack of corneocytes in which the 5-6 multilamellar lipid bilayer membranes between adjacent corneocytes are electroporated. As in artificial planar bilayer and cell membrane electroporation, a distribution of pathway sizes is expected during pulsing, and during recovery after pulsing individual pathway segments are expected to shrink and close randomly, with a time constant tau(seg) that depends on temperature and on lipid composition. Numerical simulations based on stochastic closure of individual segments were used to predict the electrical conductance G(LTR)(t) of a minimum-size LTR after pulsing stops. These theoretical results show that simple exponential decay, G(LTR)(t) = G(LTR)(0)exp(-t/tau(seg)), occurs with minimal fluctuations if the number of pathways is large (np > 10(2)), but for much smaller values the conduction decreases erratically. A ""stochastic bottleneck"" leading to complete closure is reached only at about np < 3. Thus, for the same number of electrically created pathways, the stratum corneum will remain ""open"" longer if the pathways are located within an LTR than if the same number of pathways are distributed sparsely over the skin. These predictions are relevant to postpulse transport, including the trapping of linear macromolecules that can hold pathway segments open for prolonged intervals."
11088559	Electroporation dynamics in biological cells subjected to ultrafast electrical pulses: a numerical simulation study.	A model analysis of electroporation dynamics in biological cells has been carried out based on the Smoluchowski equation. Results of the cellular response to short, electric pulses are presented, taking account of the growth and resealing dynamics of transient aqueous pores. It is shown that the application of large voltages alone may not be sufficient to cause irreversible breakdown, if the time duration is too short. Failure to cause irreversible damage at small pulse widths could be attributed to the time inadequacy for pores to grow and expand beyond a critical threshold radius. In agreement with earlier studies, it is shown that irreversible breakdown would lead to the formation of a few large pores, while a large number of smaller pores would appear in the case of reversible breakdown. Finally, a pulse width dependence of the applied voltage for irreversible breakdown has been obtained. It is shown that in the absence of dissipation, the associated energy input necessary reduces with decreasing pulse width to a limiting value. However, with circuit effects taken into account, a local minima in the pulse dependent energy function is predicted, in keeping with previously published experimental reports.
11142358	Central ring electrode for trapping and excitation/detection in Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry.	The use of a central trapping ring electrode for Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry is demonstrated. Ions are trapped with an oppositely biased static potential superimposed on both the excite and detect electrodes and maintained throughout the experiment, including the application of a dipolar rf excite waveform and the image current ion detection event. The use of a central trapping electrode for FTICR coupled with an open cell design retains the advantages of high ion throughput and gas conductance, while simplifying the electrode geometry and reducing the overall dimensions of the cell. This allows the central trapping electrode to be of utility in volume-limited vacuum chambers including FTICR instrument miniaturization. Presented here are the preliminary experimental results using the central trapping electrode as an FTICR cell in which the excitation and detection electrodes also create a trapping depression to constrain the z-axis motion of the ions. The cell overcomes the principle limitation of an earlier single trapping electrode design by producing a 91% effective potential well depth compared to 19% for the single trapping electrode and 33% for standard open cells. This allows the central trapping electrode configuration to achieve an order of magnitude improvement in ion capacity compared to more conventional open cell designs.
11321159	Strategy for increased efficiency of transfection in human cell lines using radio frequency electroporation.	Traditional electroporation devices use direct current electric fields to stimulate the uptake of oligonucleotides, plasmids, short peptides, and proteins into a variety of cell types. A variation of this widely used technique is now available which relies on radio frequency (RF) electrical pulses. This oscillating type of electrical field reportedly elicits greater uptake of plasmid DNA across the plasma membrane. We evaluated a protocol for RF electroporation of the a human embryonic kidney cell line and a Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell line for effeciency of transfection by RF electroporation. The plasmid EGFP, which codes for the widely used fusion protein, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), was used as a reporter of plasmid uptake after transfections. Transfection efficiency consistently increased approximately 30% from that typically obtained with conventional DC type electroporation and was accompanied by greater survivability of cells. Additionally, in some instances, percent transfection efficiency increased to over 70%. Thus, RF electroporation represents an improved methodology for transfection of human cell lines. Moreover, the RF protocol is simple to incorporate in laboratories already utilizing conventional electroporation devices and techniques.
11473808	Gene transfer into retinal ganglion cells by in vivo electroporation: a new approach.	We developed a new in vivo electroporation method to deliver genes into retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Efficiency and degree of tissue damage were evaluated using green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene and TUNEL. Soon after the intravitreous injection of the GFP gene, electroporation (five electric pulses of 99 ms duration each and 12V/cm delivered twice 5 min apart) was carried out on the adult rat eyeball with the aid of tweezer-type disc electrodes attached to corneal (cathode) and scleral (anode) surfaces. GFP expression, exhibiting a maximum on day 7, was detectable for up to 21 days. DiI retrograde labeling of RGCs showed that 41.5% of the total ganglion cells in the electroinjected area were GFP-positive. Therefore, this new method may be a useful tool for the delivery of genes into RGCs.
11545409	Monitoring diclofenac sodium in single human erythrocytes introduced by electroporation using capillary zone electrophoresis with electrochemical detection.	A method for determination of the drug diclofenac sodium introduced into individual human erythrocytes by electroporation using capillary zone electrophoresis with electrochemical detection at a carbon fiber array microelectrode was developed. In this method, the whole cell was injected into the separation capillary by electromigration. Cell lysis was accomplished by injecting a plug of the separation buffer (1.25 x 10(-2) mol/L Na2B4O7-3.13 x 10(-3) mol/L NaOH). The optimum conditions of separation and detection were 20 kV for the separation voltage and 1.0 V for the detection potential. The concentration of diclofenac sodium in the single cells was quantified by a calibration curve. The mean concentration of diclofenac sodium introduced into the cell was 4.21 micromol/L. The relative standard deviation of the concentration of diclofenac sodium introduced into ten cells is 10%.
12099377	Combination of electroporation and DNA/dendrimer complexes enhances gene transfer into murine cardiac transplants.	Electroporation is a new gene delivery method to increase gene transfer and expression in vivo. Starburst polyamidoamine dendrimers have been demonstrated to augment gene expression in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesized that the combination of electroporation and dendrimer could enhance the gene transfer and gene expression in cardiac transplants. After immersion in DNA/dendrimer complexes or intracoronary transfer of DNA/dendrimer complexes, both nonvascularized and vascularized syngeneic cardiac grafts, respectively, were subjected to serial electrical pulses before transplantation. beta-Galactosidase reporter gene expression in the graft was determined by X-Gal staining. Gene expression was enhanced 10- to 45-fold in grafts immersed in DNA/dendrimer complexes, or after intracoronary transfer of DNA/dendrimer complexes, and subjected to 20 square wave 25-ms pulses with a strength of 200 V/cm. The combination of electroporation and DNA/dendrimer complexes may provide a novel approach to enhance gene transfer and gene expression ex vivo.
12112645	Somatic gene transfer into the lactating ovine mammary gland.	BACKGROUND: Somatic gene therapy requires safe and efficient techniques for the gene transfer procedure. The ovine mammary gland is described as a model system for the evaluation of somatic gene transfer methods. METHODS: Different gene delivery formulations were retrogradely injected into the mammary gland of lactating sheep. The efficiency of the gene transfer was subsequently measured by the detection of the secreted transgene products in the milk. To counteract the milk flow in the lactating gland caused by the permanent milk production, a newly developed pretreatment of the mammary gland with hyperosmotic solutions was applied. In addition, in vivo electroporation of DNA into the mammary gland is described. RESULTS: Gene transfer using naked DNA or simple complexes of DNA with polycations did not result in traceable amounts of reporter gene products. However, utilizing the complex cationic lipid DOSPER, a peak expression of about 400 ng/ml was observed 6 days after transfection. Maximum expression rates of more than 1 microg/ml were obtained by combining hyperosmotic pretreatment and receptor-mediated gene transfer. For the in vivo electroporation, the proof of principle for this technique in the mammary gland is reported. CONCLUSIONS: The ovine mammary gland turned out to be a very well suited as a model system for evaluation and optimization of various gene transfer protocols.
12625756	Overview of electroporation.	This special issue of Technology in Cancer Research and Treatment focuses on the versatility of electroporation. Contributed papers report on the basic mechanisms as well as the use of this procedure ex vivo and in vivo. In addition, recent studies utilizing in vivo electroporation for plasmid DNA and drug delivery are presented.
12907953	Electroporation as a method for high-level nonviral gene transfer to the lung.	To increase the levels of pulmonary gene transfer by nonviral vectors, we have adopted electroporation protocols for use in the lung. A volume of 100-200 microl of purified plasmid DNA suspended in saline was instilled into the lungs of anesthetized mice. Plasmids expressed luciferase, or beta-galactosidase under control of the CMV immediate-early promoter and enhancer. Immediately following delivery, a series of eight square wave electric pulses of 10 ms duration each at an optimal field strength of 200 V/cm were administered to the animals using 10 mm Tweezertrodes (Genetronics, San Diego, CA, USA). The electrodes were placed on either side of the chest, which had been wetted with 70% ethanol. The animals recovered and survived with no apparent trauma until the experiments were terminated at the desired times, between 1 and 7 days post-treatment. Gene expression was detected by 1 day postelectroporation and peaked between 2 and 5 days. By 7 days, expression was back to baseline. By contrast, essentially no gene expression was detected in the absence of electric pulses. Using a beta-galactosidase-expressing plasmid, the distribution of gene expression appeared to be concentrated in the periphery of the lung, but was also present throughout the parenchyma. The primary cell types expressing gene product include alveolar type I and type II epithelial cells. No inflammation or lung injury was detected histologically or by cytokine measurements in lungs at either 1 or 24 h following electroporation treatment. These results provide evidence that electroporation is a safe and effective means for introducing naked DNA into the lung and form the basis for future studies on targeted pulmonary gene therapy.
8061622	A comparative evaluation of three transfection procedures as assessed by resistance to G418 conferred to HEPG2 cells.	Three commonly used transfection techniques (electroporation, calcium phosphate precipitation and scrape loading) and a novel procedure combining the latter two methods were evaluated and conditions optimised for successful transfection of human HepG2 cells with plasmid DNA incorporating a mouse MHC Class I gene and a selectable marker (neomycin transferase gene) conferring resistance to G418. While transfection with linear DNA by scrape-loading gave satisfactory results, transfer of cloned circular DNA by electroporation, calcium phosphate precipitation or a combined use of scrape-loading and calcium phosphate gave best results for HepG2 cells.
8158003	Efficient transfer of antibodies into mammalian cells by electroporation.	An optimized protocol for electroporation is described which is suitable for introducing antibodies into mammalian cells. The method results in the uptake of detectable amounts of antibodies in 80% of the cells and in 40% large amounts are introduced. As an example, cell cycle activity (transition from the G1 to S phase) was inhibited by the introduction of monoclonal antibodies against G1-specific cyclin D1 into CV-1 and MCF7 cells. This specific antibody mediated inhibition of cellular function did not affect the viability of the cells since they recovered from the inhibition after some time. While approaching the efficiency of microinjection, the new protocol for electroporation of antibodies additionally permits treatment of the larger number of cells which are required for biochemical analyses.
8202518	Stable DNA transformation in the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii by complementation of tryptophan auxotrophy.	The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii infects a wide range of vertebrate hosts and is an important opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised humans. Although Toxoplasma is amenable to both biochemical and cellular experimental approaches, the molecular basis of its success as an intracellular parasite is poorly understood. To provide a system for molecular genetic analyses, we have developed a stable DNA transformation system for Toxoplasma based on complementation of its naturally occurring tryptophan auxotrophy. Complementation was accomplished by expressing the Escherichia coli trpB gene, encoding the beta subunit of tryptophan synthase (EC 4.2.1.20), the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of tryptophan from indole plus serine. Transformants were obtained by electroporation of a plasmid, called SAG1/trpB, containing the trpB gene flanked by Toxoplasma surface antigen 1 (SAG1) gene sequences and selection for growth on indole. Transformants were obtained with circular forms of the SAG1/trpB plasmid with efficiencies of 10(-4) per cell. Transformation with either circular or linear SAG1/trpB resulted in integration into the genome at distinct, nonhomologous sites. Trp+ transformants typically contained tandemly repeated copies of the SAG1/trpB plasmid and were stable in the absence of continued selection. The Trp phenotype provides a dominant selectable marker that should allow expression of foreign or altered genes in Toxoplasma and facilitate molecular analyses of genes important for intracellular survival.
10215040	Long duration electroporation for achieving high level expression of glucocorticoid receptors in mammalian cell lines.	A method is presented that utilizes long duration electroporation (LDE) to more efficiently introduce DNA into mammalian cell lines than standard electroporation techniques. With SV40-based vectors, more than 550,000 glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) per cell could be obtained in COS-7 cells with good cell survival. In experiments with a CMV-driven vector expressing an enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP), 54% of the cells were transfected, and 77% of EGFP positive cells expressed EGFP at moderate to high levels. In cell lines not containing the large T antigen, a CMV-driven vector for the GR was superior to the SV40-based vector. In EDR3, DG44, and CV-1 cell lines approximately 220,000, 190,000 and 150,000 GRs/cell were obtained, respectively. Transfection efficiency of the EGFP vector ranged from 44 to 55% for the three cell lines. Cortisol treatment of COS-7 and DG44 cultures cotransfected with vectors expressing the GR and a GRE driven luciferase gene produced 4 to 12 times more enzyme activity per plate with LDE than conventional electroporation protocols. LDE allows transient overexpression of proteins in COS-7 cells at the high levels generally achieved by mammalian overexpression systems only in stable cell lines.
10649777	Localized electroporation: a method for targeting expression of genes in avian embryos.	Avian embryos are a popular model for cell and developmental biologists. However, analysis of gene function in living embryos has been hampered by difficulties in targeting the expression of exogenous genes. We have developed a method for localized electroporation that overcomes some of the limitations of current techniques. We use a double-barreled suction electrode, backfilled with a solution containing a plasmid-encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a neurophysiological stimulator to electroporate small populations of cells in living embryos. As many as 600 cells express GFP 24-48 h after electroporation. The number of cells that express GFP depends on the number of trains, the pulse frequency and the voltage. Surface epithelial cells and cells deep to the point of electroporation express GFP. No deformities result from electroporations, and neurons, neural crest, head mesenchyme, lens and otic placode cells have been transfected. This method overcomes some of the disadvantages of viral techniques, lipofection and in vivo electroporation. The method will be useful to biologists interested in tracing cell lineage or making genetic mosaic avian embryos.
11143387	Kinetics of pore disappearance in a cell after electroporation.	The process of pore disappearance after cell electroporation is analysed theoretically. On the basis of the kinetic model, in which the formation and annihilation of a metastable hydrophilic pore are considered as random one-step processes, a distribution function of cell resealing times, Fr(t), is derived. The shape of this function depends on the initial number of pores in a cell, ni. The developed theory is compared with experimental data. Although the shape of experimental relationships depends on the electroporation conditions, they can be described by theoretical curves quite well. Increasing the amplitude of an electric pulse increases the number of pores and/or the rate of their resealing. It was concluded that the disappearance of pores in the cell membrane after electroporation is a random process.
11313815	Efficient expression of foreign genes in human CD34(+) hematopoietic precursor cells using electroporation.	Introduction of foreign genes into human CD34(+) hematopoietic precursor cells offers a means to correct inborn errors or to protect human stem cells from chemotherapeutic damage. Electroporation is a non-chemical, nonviral, highly reproducible means to introduce foreign genes into mammalian cells that has been used primarily for rapidly dividing cells. CD34(+) cells isolated from mobilized peripheral blood of patients were cultured for 48 h in serum-free culture medium supplemented with Flt-3 ligand, stem cell factor and thrombopoietin. Cell cycle analysis showed an increase in % S-phase from 2% on day 0 to 28% on day 2 without significant loss of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). Optimal electroporation conditions for CD34(+) cells were 550 V/cm, 38 ms, 30 microg DNA/500 microl at cell densities between 0.2 x 10(6) and 10 x 10(6) cells/ml resulting in transient EGFP gene expression in 21% (+/- 1%) of CD34(+) precursor cells, as determined by flow cytometry 48 h after electroporation. The more primitive cells were also found to be EGFP(+) as determined by subset analysis using Thy1, CD38, AC133 and c-kit conjugated monoclonal antibodies. Methylcellulose assays on electroporated CD34(+) cells yielded 20% (+/- 7%) EGFP(+) colonies (CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-mix) and 22% (+/- 5%) EGFP(+) long-term colony-initiating cells (LTC-IC). The reporter gene was found to be integrated into the LTC-IC genomic DNA as determined by inverse PCR and DNA sequencing. These results suggest that electroporation has the potential to effectively and stably deliver exogenous genes into human hematopoietic precursor cells.
11772607	Electrotransformation of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis with various plasmids.	We describe, for the first time, a detailed electroporation procedure for Lactobacillus delbrueckii. Three L. delbrueckii strains were successfully transformed. Under optimal conditions, the transformation efficiency was 10(4) transformants per microg of DNA. Using this procedure, we identified several plasmids able to replicate in L. delbrueckii and integrated an integrative vector based on phage integrative elements into the L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus chromosome. These vectors provide a good basis for developing molecular tools for L. delbrueckii and open the field of genetic studies in L. delbrueckii.
12005886	Improved energy model for membrane electroporation in biological cells subjected to electrical pulses.	A self-consistent model analysis of electroporation in biological cells has been carried out based on an improved energy model. The simple energy model used in the literature is somewhat incorrect and unphysical for a variety of reasons. Our model for the pore formation energy E(r) includes a dependence on pore population and density. It also allows for variable surface tension, incorporates the effects of finite conductivity on the electrostatic correction term, and is dynamic in nature. Self-consistent calculations, based on a coupled scheme involving the Smoluchowski equation and the improved energy model, are presented. It is shown that E(r) becomes self-adjusting with variations in its magnitude and profile, in response to pore population, and inhibits uncontrolled pore growth and expansion. This theory can be augmented to include pore-pore interactions to move beyond the independent pore picture.
12147134	Targeted electroporation in Xenopus tadpoles in vivo--from single cells to the entire brain.	Electroporation is becoming more popular as a technique for transfecting neurons within intact tissues. One of the advantages of electroporation over other transfection techniques is the ability to precisely target an area for transfection. Here we highlight this advantage by describing methods to restrict transfection to either a single cell, clusters of cells, or to include large portions of the brain of the intact Xenopus tadpole. Electroporation is also an effective means of gene delivery in the retina. We have developed these techniques to examine the effects of regulated gene expression on various neuronal properties, including structural plasticity and synaptic transmission. Restriction of transfection to individual cells aids in imaging of neuronal morphology, while bulk cell transfection allows examination of the affects of gene expression on populations of cells by biochemical assays, imaging, and electrophysiological recording.
12215892	Electroporation-mediated pain-killer gene therapy for mononeuropathic rats.	The relatively low expression levels achieved from transferred genes have limited the application of nonviral vectors for gene transfer into the spinal cord in vivo. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of electroporation-mediated pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene therapy for neuropathic pain using an animal model of chronic constrictive injury (CCI). Firstly, the optimal pulse characteristics (voltage, pulse duration, number of shocks) were investigated for in vivo electroporation-mediated gene transfer into the spinal cord. The electroporation process makes use of plasmid DNA, which expresses the POMC gene. Expression levels were evaluated in this study by Western blot. We conclude that the optimal conditions for electroporation are a pulse voltage of 200 V, 75-ms duration, 925-ms interval, for five iterations. Secondly, electroporation treatment for neuropathic pain was attempted on CCI rats using plasmid DNA that expresses the POMC gene. Intrathecal administrations of the POMC vector elevated spinal beta-endorphin levels, as manifested in a significantly elevated pain threshold for the CCI limbs. This result suggests that gene therapy for neuropathic pain using this novel technique is very efficacious, and thus shows promise for further clinical trials.
12378637	Effects of electroporation on primary rat hepatocytes in vitro.	AIM: To investigate the effects of electroporation on primary rat hepatocyte and to optimize the electroporation conditions introducing foreign genes into primary hepatocytes. METHODS: A single-pulse procedure was performed at low voltage (220-400 V) but with high capacitance (500-950 microF). Hepatocytes were divided into 4 groups according to the electroporation conditions: group I, 220 V and 500 microF; group II, 220 V and 950 microF; group III, 400 V and 950 microF,and group IV. The control group was freshly isolated hepatocytes and directly cultured under the same conditions as those of electroporation groups. The effects of electroporation on primary rat hepatocytes were detected by trypan blue exclusion (TBE) and MTT analysis. Besides, albumin (Alb), alanine transaminase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the supernatants of cultured hepatocytes were measured by biochemical assay. RESULTS: Between day 1 and day 15 after incubation, primary rat hepatocytes of each electroporation group appeared normal, being the same with those of control group. TBE staining showed that slight hepatocyte damage and high survival rate were found in the electroporation groups and the control group. Cultured for 3, 7, 11 and 15 days, hepatocyte viability was approximately 92.6+/-2.5 %, 89.5+/-3.3 %, 82.0+/-3.5 % and 74.3+/-1.2 %, respectively. MTT analysis indicated that the viabilities of hepatocytes had no significant difference between each electroporation group, and those were similar to that of control group. At the 36th hour after electroporation, Alb, ALT and LDH in the supernatants of control group were 5.3+/-0.1 g x L(-1), 183.7+/-8.4 nkat x L(-1) and 896.8+/-58.5 nkat x L(-1); those of group II were 5.7+/-0.1 g x L(-1), 215.4+/-16.7 nkat x L(-1) and 1063.8+/-51.8 nkat x L(-1); and those of group III were 5.8+/-0.2 g x L(-1), 217.1+/-8.4 nkat x L(-1) and 1063.8+/-10.0 nkat x L(-1). Statistically, the proteins of group II and group III were significantly higher than those of control group (P<0.05), whereas the protein production of group I, Alb, ALT and LDH were 5.3+/-0.2 g x L(-1), 205.4+/-3.3 nkat x L(-1) and 1035.4+/-116.9 nkat x L(-1), were similar to those of control group. At the same time, TBE and MTT analysis indicated that there was no significant cell viability difference between electroporation groups and control group. CONCLUSION: This single-pulse electroporation procedure performed at low voltage (220-400 V) but with high capacitance (950 microF) is one of the optimal choices to introduce foreign genes into primary rat hepatocyte.
12625758	Digression on membrane electroporation for drug and gene delivery.	Membrane electroporation (ME) defines an electrical technique to render lipid membranes porous and permeable, transiently and reversibly, by external voltage pulses. Although there are numerous applications of ME to manipulate cells, organelles and tissues in cell biology, biotechnology and medicine, yet the molecular mechanism of ME is only slowly being understood. A general chemical- thermodynamical approach for the quantitative description of cell membrane electroporation has been developed to provide the framework to quantitatively rationalize electroporative cell transformation and electroporative uptake of drug-like dyes into cells, as well as electrolyte efflux from salt-filled electroporated vesicles. Mechanistically, the electroporative transfer of gene and drug-like dyes involves the coupling between an interactive contact formation of the permeates with the cell surface membrane and the structural electroporation-resealing cycle C <--> (P) where C is the closed and (P) represents a number of different porated membrane states, respectively. The experimentally accessible concentration fraction f(p) = [(P)] / ([C] + [(P)]) of porous states is related to thermodynamic and electro-mechanic parameters such as temperature and the electric field strength, membrane rigidity or curvature. The results of the theoretical approach, mainly based on electrooptical data of lipid vesicles, have been successfully used to analyze single cells and to specify conditions for the practical purpose of direct electroporative gene transfer and drug delivery, in particular in the new medical disciplines of electroporative chemotherapy and electroporative gene vaccination.
12625759	Highly efficient, large volume flow electroporation.	Electroporation is widely used to transfect and load cells with various molecules. Traditional electroporation using a static mode is typically restricted to volumes less than 1 mL, which limits its use in clinical and industrial bioprocessing applications. Here we report efficient, large volume transfection results by using a scalable-volume electroporation system. Suspended (Jurkat) and adherent cells (10T1/2 and Huh-7) were tested. A large macromolecule, FITC-conjugated dextran (MW=500 kD) was used to measure cell uptake, while a plasmid carrying the gene coding for enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) was used to quantitate the flow electrotransfection efficiency as determined by flow cytometry. The flow electroloading efficiency of FITC-dextran was >90%, while the cell viability was highly maintained (>90%). High flow electrotransfection efficiency (up to 75%) and cell viability (up to 90%) were obtained with processing volumes ranging from 1.5 to 50 mL. No significant difference of electrotransfection efficiency was observed between flow and static electrotransfection. When 50 mL of cell volume was processed and samples collected at different time points during electroporation, the transgene expression and cell viability results were identical. We also demonstrated that DNA plasmid containing EBNA1-OriP elements from Epstein-Barr virus were more efficient in transgene expression than standard plasmid without the elements (at least 500 too 1000-fold increase in expression level). Finally, to examine the feasibility of utilizing flow electrotransfected cells as a gene delivery vehicle, 10T1/2 cells were transfected with a DNA plasmid containing the gene coding for mIL12. mIL12 transfected cells were injected subcutaneously into mice, and produced functional mIL12, as demonstrated by anti-angiogenic activity. This is the first demonstration of efficient, large volume, flow electroporation and the in vivo efficacy of flow electrotransfected cells. This technology may be useful for clinical gene therapy and large-scale bioprocesses.
12648161	Electroporation: theory and methods, perspectives for drug delivery, gene therapy and research.	Electroporation designates the use of short high-voltage pulses to overcome the barrier of the cell membrane. By applying an external electric field, which just surpasses the capacitance of the cell membrane, transient and reversible breakdown of the membrane can be induced. This transient, permeabilized state can be used to load cells with a variety of different molecules, either through simple diffusion in the case of small molecules, or through electrophoretically driven processes allowing passage through the destabilized membrane--as is the case for DNA transfer. Initially developed for gene transfer, electroporation is now in use for delivery of a large variety of molecules: From ions to drugs, dyes, tracers, antibodies, and oligonucleotides to RNA and DNA. Electroporation has proven useful both in vitro, in vivo and in patients, where drug delivery to malignant tumours has been performed. Whereas initial electroporation procedures caused considerable cell damage, developments over the past decades have led to sophistication of equipment and optimization of protocols. The electroporation procedures used in many laboratories could be optimized with limited effort. This review (i) outlines the theory of electroporation, (ii) discusses factors of importance for optimization of electroporation protocols for mammalian cells, (iii) addresses particular concerns when using electroporation in vivo, e.g. effects on blood flow and considerations regarding choice of electrodes, (iv) describes DNA electrotransfer with emphasis on use in the in vivo setting, and (v) sums up data on safety and efficacy of electroporation used to enhance delivery of chemotherapy to tumours in cancer patients.
12915125	Electrotransfection of anchorage-dependent mammalian cells.	Reversible electropermeabilization (or electroporation) of cell membranes is a very efficient method for intracellular delivery of xenomolecules, particularly of DNA. In the case of anchorage-dependent cells, however, enzymatic or mechanical detachment from the substratum is required prior to electropulsing. This can damage the plasma membrane and lead to low transfection yields. Here we present an efficient method for in situ electroporation of mammalian cells while they are attached to a solid substratum. For this purpose an electroporation chamber was constructed that housed a cell culture insert with a cell monolayer grown on a porous filter. By real-time monitoring the transmonolayer resistance, the field pulse parameters resulting in transient and reversible permeabilization of cell membranes were determined for two adherent cell lines, which were found to differ markedly in their sensitivity to electropulsing. Based on the transmonolayer resistance data, the pulsing conditions for optimum electrotransfection of two murine cell lines with plasmid DNA could be established in a very short time. The transfection yield and gene expression were significantly higher in cell monolayers facing the cathode compared to those exposed to field pulses of the reverse direction. This might be due to contribution of the electrophoresis to the translocation of the polyanionic plasmid DNA across the electropermeabilized cell membrane. The experimental setup presented here appears to be a promising tool not only for rapid optimization of in situ electrotransfection of anchorage-dependent cells but also for studying the molecular/biophysical mechanisms of the membrane breakdown and resealing.
7659501	Efficient in situ electroporation of mammalian cells grown on microporous membranes.	Electroporation is a common technique for the introduction of DNA molecules into living cells. The method is currently limited by the necessity of applying the electrical discharge to cells in suspension. Adherent cells must therefore be removed from their substratum, which can induce unwanted physiological effects. We report here a new procedure for in situ electroporation of cells grown on microporous membranes of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polyester (PE). We demonstrate that this method of in situ electroporation employs only readily available materials and standard electroporation devices without any modifications, is as efficient as conventional electroporation of cells in suspension, and is applicable to a wide range of cell types. Efficient electroporation can be achieved under conditions of minimal cell killing, and can be performed with quiescent cells as well as with confluent epithelial sheets. The method is a useful extension of electroporation technology, and will allow the application of electroporation to a wider spectrum of biological systems.
9336174	Electroporation-induced formation of individual calcium entry sites in the cell body and processes of adherent cells.	Electroporation is a widely used method for introducing macromolecules into cells. We developed an electroporation device that requires only 1 microl of sample to load adherent cells in a 10-mm2 surface area while retaining greater than 90% cell survivability. To better understand this device, field-induced permeabilization of adherent rat basophilic leukemia and neocortical neuroblastoma cells was investigated by using fluorescent calcium and voltage indicators. Rectangular field pulses led to the formation of only a few calcium entry sites, preferentially in the hyperpolarized parts of the cell body and processes. Individual entry sites were formed at the same locations when field pulses were repeated. Before calcium entry, a partial breakdown of the membrane potential was observed in both polar regions. Based on our results, a model is proposed for the formation and closure of macromolecule entry sites in adherent cells. First, the rapid formation of a large number of small pores leads to a partial membrane potential breakdown in both polar regions of the cell. Second, over tens of milliseconds, a few entry sites for macromolecules are formed, preferentially in the hyperpolarized part of cell body and processes, at locations defined by the local membrane structure. These entry sites reseal on a time scale of 50 ms to several seconds, with residual small pores remaining open for several minutes.
9714890	Highly efficient oligonucleotide transfer into intact yeast cells using square-wave pulse electroporation.	Here, we present a rapid and reproducible procedure based on square-wave pulse electroporation that allows efficient penetration of synthetic oligonucleotides into intact yeast cells. This procedure was successfully used to modify the yeast genome with small amounts of oligonucleotide.
9724707	Altering the biochemical state of individual cultured cells and organelles with ultramicroelectrodes.	We describe an efficient technique for the selective chemical and biological manipulation of the contents of individual cells. This technique is based on the electric-field-induced permeabilization (electroporation) in biological membranes using a low-voltage pulse generator and microelectrodes. A spatially highly focused electric field allows introduction of polar cell-impermeant solutes such as fluorescent dyes, fluorogenic reagents, and DNA into single cells. The high spatial resolution of the technique allows for design of, for example, cellular network constructions in which cells in close contact with each other can be made to possess different biochemical, biophysical, and morphological properties. Fluorescein, and fluo-3 (a calcium-sensitive fluorophore), are electroporated into the soma of cultured single progenitor cells derived from adult rat hippocampus. Fluo-3 also is introduced into individual submicrometer diameter processes of thapsigargin-treated progenitor cells, and a plasmid vector cDNA construct (pRAY 1), expressing the green fluorescent protein, is electroporated into cultured single COS 7 cells. At high electric field strengths, observations of dye-transfer into organelles are proposed.

"The authors describe the historical evolution of the prevention in Lombardia, and the role of the Hospital Units for Occupational Medicine, not only on the clinical oriented fields, but also on the areas of formation and training. Hospital Units for Occupational Medicine are today the best synthesis of ""occupational-environmental-community health"". There development is based on adequate standards of human and instrumental resources, as so as a real financial budget. At last, it's important that these Units are allocated in a so-called ""bipolar department"", open to the hospital and also open to the territorial structures for prevention and safety (department of occupational health)."
10397753	The C-terminal domain of p21 inhibits nucleotide excision repair In vitro and In vivo.	The protein p21(Cip1, Waf1, Sdi1) is a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). p21 can also block DNA replication through its interaction with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which is an auxiliary factor for polymerase delta. PCNA is also implicated in the repair resynthesis step of nucleotide excision repair (NER). Previous studies have yielded contradictory results on whether p21 regulates NER through its interaction with PCNA. Resolution of this controversy is of interest because it would help understand how DNA repair and replication are regulated. Hence, we have investigated the effect of p21 on NER both in vitro and in vivo using purified fragments of p21 containing either the CDK-binding domain (N terminus) or the PCNA binding domain (C terminus) of the protein. In the in vitro studies, DNA repair synthesis was measured in extracts from normal human fibroblasts using plasmids damaged by UV irradiation. In the in vivo studies, we used intact and permeabilized cells. The results show that the C terminus of the p21 protein inhibits NER both in vitro and in vivo. These are the first in vivo studies in which this question has been examined, and we demonstrate that inhibition of NER by p21 is not merely an artificial in vitro effect. A 50% inhibition of in vitro NER occurred at a 50:1 molar ratio of p21 C-terminus fragment to PCNA monomer. p21 differentially regulates DNA repair and replication, with repair being much less sensitive to inhibition than replication. Our in vivo results suggest that the inhibition occurs at the resynthesis step of the repair process. It also appears that preassembly of PCNA at repair sites mitigates the inhibitory effect of p21. We further demonstrate that the inhibition of DNA repair is mediated via binding of p21 to PCNA. The N terminus of p21 had no effect on DNA repair, and the inhibition of DNA repair by the C terminus of p21 was relieved by the addition of purified PCNA protein.
11249643	Technology evaluation: electroporation therapy, Genetronics Inc.	Genetronics Inc has developed a MedPulser and a needle array applicator that delivers electric pulses to tumors and induces a transient permeabilization. Used in conjunction with intratumoral injections of anticancer drugs, this form of therapy, termed electroporation therapy, allows for intracellular accumulation of cytotoxic drugs without the toxic side effects associated with systemic administration. Accrual of preclinical data of electroporation therapy with bleomycin has led to clinical studies in patients with cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors. In 1999, objective responses were reported in a phase II study involving 30 patients with head and neck cancer with minimal side effects [328332]. Other indications for this form of treatment include liver and pancreatic cancers, Kaposi's sarcoma and melanoma [273388,290144]. Genetronics Inc and Ethicon Endo-Surgery (Johnson & Johnson Development Corp) are reviewing all clinical data from phase II studies prior to the initiation of a pivotal clinical trial in head and neck cancer.
11301019	Single-cell electroporation for gene transfer in vivo.	We report an electroporation technique for targeting gene transfer to individual cells in intact tissue. Electrical stimulation through a micropipette filled with DNA or other macromolecules electroporates a single cell at the tip of the micropipette. Electroporation of a plasmid encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the brain of intact Xenopus tadpoles or rat hippocampal slices resulted in GFP expression in single neurons and glia. In vivo imaging showed morphologies, dendritic arbor dynamics, and growth rates characteristic of healthy cells. Coelectroporation of two plasmids resulted in expression of both proteins, while electroporation of fluorescent dextrans allowed direct visualization of transfer of molecules into cells. This technique will allow unprecedented spatial and temporal control over gene delivery and protein expression.
11327801	Introduction of DNA into chick embryos by in ovo electroporation.	Gene transfer by in ovo electroporation has been applied to the study of developmental biology, especially to central nervous system (CNS) development. Plasmids are injected into the neural tube of stage 10 chick embryos, and a 25-V 25-msec square pulse is applied five times. Since DNA moves toward the anode, the cathode side of the neural tube is transfected, and the cathode side is used as the control. Expression of translation product of the introduced DNA is observed 2 h after electroporation, peaks around 20 h after electroporation and then weakens. Expression is transient when plasmids are used as expression vectors, but they are very suitable for studying early developmental events (e.g., gene expression cascades or interactions). Misexpression of Pax-5 is shown as an example.
11440782	Electrochemotherapy in primary and metastatic skin tumors: phase II trial using intralesional bleomycin.	BACKGROUND: Surgery and/or radiotherapy are the elective therapies for most primary skin cancers. Nevertheless, some patients develop recurrences, and chemotherapy has resulted in poor complete responses. Permeabilization of the cell membrane by electric pulses allows bleomycin to enter into the cell, increasing possibility of cytotoxicity. METHODS: From November 1998 through November 1999, 15 patients with 38 skin lesions participated in a phase II prospective clinical trial, using intralesional bleomycin plus electric pulses delivered 10 min after bleomycin injection, which lasted 100 microsec each at field strength of 1,300 V/cm and a frequency of 1 Hz. There were basal cell carcinomas (BCC) (nine lesions), in-transit metastasis of melanoma (MM) (two patients/13 nodules), squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the upper aerodigestive tract metastatic to the skin (two patients/two nodules), and skin metastases from breast cancer (two patients/14 nodules). Mean follow-up was 8.6 months. RESULTS: Overall objective responses were 98%, with complete responses achieved in 49%, partial responses in 49%, and no responses in 2%. No complications were documented related to the treatment and tolerance was adequate. CONCLUSIONS: Electrochemotherapy (ECT) is a new cancer modality of treatment that is effective in a variety of skin cancers. This treatment represents an excellent alternative to standard surgery or radiotherapy, with an outpatient-based treatment applied in one to three sessions. The major impact was obtained in BBC, but ECT is a useful palliative therapy in melanoma, breast cancer, or SCC. More experience and longer follow-up are required to determine long-term results.
11750982	Electroporation for direct spinal gene transfer in rats.	We investigated the feasibility of delivering exogenous genes into spinal cord using direct in vivo electrotransfection. Gene transfer to the spinal cord was accomplished via direct intrathecal injection of pE-GFP C1 vector, followed by five electric pulses for 50 ms at 200 V delivered intrathecally. The spinal cords were retrieved and analyzed with fluorescence microscopy, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and Western blotting. At day 1, 3 or 7 following electroporation a clear GFP expression in spinal cord tissue was detected. The most prominent transfection occurred in the meningeal cells and superficial layer of the spinal cord. Successful transfection was also confirmed with RT-PCR and Western blotting. The expression of GFP protein was peaked between 3 and 7 days after electroporation and significantly decreased at 14 days. No behavioral or spinal neurodegenerative changes were detected at any time point. This study demonstrates that direct in vivo electrotransfection represents an effective and simple method for spinal gene delivery and have a potential to be used clinically, especially, acute or chronic pain.
12188187	Recovery of adherent cells after in situ electroporation monitored electrically.	Here we describe various experiments that address the efficiency of loading extracellular probes into the cytoplasm of adherent mammalian cells (normal rat kidney, Madin-Darby canine kidney, and African green monkey) by means of in situ electroporation. Subsequent cell recovery from the electroporation pulse was monitored electrically in real time for each condition. In this study, small, gold-film electrodes (5 x 10(-4) cm2) are used as culture substrates and at the same time as an electrode for both the application of the electroporating voltage pulse and the noninvasive electrical monitoring of cell recovery, using a technique referred to as ECIS. Electroporation has been performed by using ac sinusoidal voltage pulses of varying frequency, amplitude, and duration. Permeabilization and re-closure of the plasma membrane were evaluated by the uptake of the fluorescence probe, Lucifer Yellow, from the extracellularfluid. With the experimental setup described here, efficient electroporation was achieved with voltages less than 5 V. Using ECIS, we followed the morphological response of the cells to the electricfield-induced membrane permeabilization. For optimized electroporation conditions, cell recovery was completed in less than 1 h. The introduction of membrane-impermeable substances by electroporation and in situ monitoring of the cellular response mayfind many applications in cell biology.
12189529	Efficient genetic modification of murine dendritic cells by electroporation with mRNA.	Recently, human dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with mRNA encoding a broad range of tumor antigens have proven to be potent activators of a primary anti-tumor-specific T-cell response in vitro. The aim of this study was to improve the mRNA pulsing of murine DC. Compared to a standard lipofection protocol and passive pulsing, electroporation was, in our hands, the most efficient method. The optimal conditions to electroporate murine bone marrow-derived DCs with mRNA were determined using enhanced green fluorescent protein and a truncated form of the nerve growth factor receptor. We could obtain high transfection efficiencies around 70-80% with a mean fluorescence intensity of 100-200. A maximal expression level was reached 3 hours after electroporation. A clear dose-response effect was seen depending on the amount of mRNA used. Importantly, the electroporation process did not affect the viability nor the allostimulatory capacity or phenotype of the DC. To study the capacity of mRNA-electroporated DCs to present antigen in the context of MHC classes I and II, we made use of chimeric constructs of ovalbumin. The dose-dependent response effect and the duration of presentation were also determined. Together, these results demonstrate that mRNA electroporation is a useful method to generate genetically modified murine DC, which can be used for preclinical studies testing immunotherapeutic approaches.
12467220	Inhibition of growth of human prostate cancer xenograft by transfection of p53 gene: gene transfer by electroporation.	To date, there is no effective therapy for hormone-independent prostate cancer. Therefore, as a new strategy for refractory cancer, gene therapy is showing increasing promise. In this study, we attempted to use a nonviral gene transfer system, in vivo electroporation, in prostate cancer cell PC-3 xenografts with the wild-type p53 (wt-p53) gene, as gene therapy for hormone-independent prostate cancer. To evaluate this in vivo gene transfer method, the beta-galactosidase gene was transfected into xenografts by electroporation. Then, the efficiency of transfection of exogenous p53 gene by electroporation was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR, which indicated that p53 mRNA was present in samples from xenografts. Next, to estimate the reduction of prostate cancer xenografts by this method, we measured the size of PC-3 xenografts in nude mice after electroporation with the wt-p53 gene. The growth of tumors was markedly suppressed by wt-p53 gene transfection by electroporation compared with transfection of mutated type p53 gene (P = 0.0027) or vector only (P = 0.0015). Furthermore, histological specimens revealed increased apoptotic cell death in p53-transfected tumors. These results suggest that it is possible to transfer wt-p53 into prostate cancer xenografts using electroporation and to suppress the growth of tumors; they, furthermore, suggest that this system might be used for local advanced hormone-independent prostate cancer.
7575682	Ryanodine as inhibitor of chemotactic peptide-induced chemotaxis in human neutrophils.	Ryanodine gave a moderate inhibition of chemotactic peptide-activated chemotaxis by intact human neutrophils. Chemotaxis by electroporated neutrophils was strongly inhibited in the nanomolar concentration range. Inhibition of chemotaxis by electroporated neutrophils occurs at concentrations known to open calcium channels in ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores. Whereas migration by formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)- or interleukin-8-activated electroporated neutrophils was strongly inhibited by ryanodine, chemotaxis induced by protein kinase C activators was not affected. This suggests that the importance of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores for migration depends on the type of activator used. Ryanodine gave an increase of cytoplasmic free calcium due to the liberation of calcium from internal stores and to the influx of extracellular calcium. The results show that the neutrophil contains ryanodine-sensitive calcium stores that might be involved in receptor-mediated chemotaxis.
8108113	Cyclin D1 protein oscillates and is essential for cell cycle progression in human tumour cell lines.	Among the key cell cycle regulators, cyclin D1 has been implicated most strongly in oncogenesis. This G1 cyclin is a putative proto-oncogene whose clonal rearrangement and/or amplification and mRNA overexpression occurs in several types of human neoplasias. We have now raised a series of monoclonal antibodies to human cyclin D1 and analysed its regulation at the protein level in 40 human tumour cell lines. We found that 12 cell lines displayed low or undetectable cyclin D1 protein level, while the remaining lines accumulated the protein to a level comparable to, or moderately higher than, that of four normal diploid non-immortalized cell types. The cell cycle-dependent oscillation and subcellular localization of cyclin D1 were similar in both tumour and normal cells. The protein localized to the nucleus of G1 cells, and it was reduced to immunocytochemically undetectable level in DNA-replicating cells. At the functional level, microinjection and electroporation of anti-D1 antibodies revealed that in most tumour cell lines studied, including those with amplification at the cyclin D1 locus, this cyclin is essential for cell cycle progression in G1. Some tumours, however, seem to have evolved mechanism(s) that enable them to bypass the requirement for functional cyclin D1.
9326374	Sphingosine-mediated electroporative DNA transfer through lipid bilayers.	When the cationic sphingosine is present in planar lipid bilayers, the adsorption of pDNA is enhanced and the electroporatability of the bilayer is facilitated. Furthermore, pDNA, adsorbed to lipid bilayers composed of diphytanoyl lecithin and D-sphingosine causes electroporative channel-like events of conductance 1 to 7 pS, provided the voltage polarity is correct and the voltage is high enough, Vm > or = +30 mV. The data suggest electrotransport of pDNA through the bilayer, mediated by transient complexes between DNA and the lipids in the pore edges of elongated, electropercolated hydrophilic pore zones. The results are the basis for the optimisation of electroporative transfer of DNA or oligonucleotides to cells and tissue.
9851051	Genetic transformation of germinated conidia of the thermophilic fungus Humicola grisea var. thermoidea to hygromycin B resistance.	Germinated conidia of the thermophilic fungus Humicola grisea var. thermoidea were transformed to hygromycin B resistance using the plasmid pAN7.1. Transformation was achieved using lithium acetate treatment or electroporation. The efficiency of transformation was up to 32 and 25 transformants per microgram of plasmid DNA with the two methods, respectively. Transformants obtained by the lithium acetate method were more stable and showed a high copy number of the hph gene integrated into their genome. The other transformants, from the electroporation procedure, were stable, but unable to grow in the presence of high levels of hygromycin, and detection of the hph gene was only possible by polymerase chain reaction analysis.
10066453	Optimisation of electroporation for biochemical experiments in live cells.	To introduce into cells small molecules, which do not permeate the cell membrane naturally, electroporation is the fastest and most efficient technique. Although it is not completely benign, the speed at which a full population of cells can be permeated gives it a strong advantage over all other cell permeation techniques. Here we describe the potential damaging effects of electroporation and how to derive conditions which avoid these and assure its use for biochemical experiments in live cells.
10194562	Kinetics of sealing for transient electropores in isolated mammalian skeletal muscle cells.	Permeabilization of the plasma membrane by electrical forces (electroporation) can be either transient or stable. Although the exact molecular mechanics have not yet been described, electroporation is believed to initiate primarily in the lipid bilayer. To better understand the kinetics of membrane permeabilization, we sought to determine the time constants for spontaneous transient pore sealing. By using isolated rat flexor digitorum brevis skeletal muscle cells and a two-compartment diffusion model, we found that pore sealing times (tau p) after transient electroporation were approximately 9 min. tau p was not significantly dependent on the imposed transmembrane potential. We also determined the transmembrane potential (delta Vm) thresholds necessary for transient and stable electroporation in the skeletal muscle cells. delta VmS ranging between 340 mV and 480 mV caused a transient influx of magnesium, indicating the existence of spontaneously sealing pores. An imposed delta Vm of 540 mV or greater led to complete equilibration of the intracellular and extracellular magnesium concentrations. This finding suggests that stable pores are created by the larger imposed transmembrane potentials. These results may be useful for understanding nerve and skeletal muscle injury after an electrical shock and for developing optimal strategies for accomplishing transient electroporation, particularly for gene transfection and cell transformation.
10211543	Antitumor drug delivery by tissue electroporation.	Tissue electroporation has been explored to enhance the local delivery of chemotherapueutic agents to solid tumors. The technique, known as electrochemotherapy (ECT), uses high-voltage pulses to deliver drugs across cancerous tissues. ECT has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment for cutaneous malignancies. Recent studies also indicate that the applications of ECT can be extended from the treatment of cutaneous cancers to the treatment of tumors of vital organs such as brain, liver, lungs and others. This review also discusses electrogene antitumor therapy.
10824986	Electroporation of salmon sperm for gene transfer: efficiency, reliability, and fate of transgene.	Uptake of exogenous DNA by electroporated salmon sperm for gene transfer is being investigated. Our studies show that electroporated salmon sperm cells were more efficient and more reliable than untreated sperm in picking up exogenous DNA and subsequently transferring the DNA into salmon embryos. Indirect evidence suggest that some of the exogenous DNA was internalized in the sperm nuclei. The taken up DNA retained its integrity as demonstrated by PCR. The foreign DNA was detected in 15-month-old fish, and had a mosaic pattern of distribution. Integration of the foreign DNA occurred infrequently, and the expression of the foreign genes was poor. The potential of sperm-mediated gene transfer as a routine protocol for mass gene transfer in salmon will be dependent on the improvement of integration and expression of the foreign gene.
10831279	Toxicity of anticancer agents mediated by electroporation in vitro.	Electroporation is a physical event that temporarily reduces cell membrane barrier properties. Diminished membrane barrier properties are achieved by exposing cells to pulsed electric fields. When a cell has been treated with electric fields it is possible for extracellular agents to gain access to the cell interior. This process has been used in vivo to increase the uptake of chemotherapeutic agents by tumor cells which results in dramatically higher response rates than when drug is used alone. This type of treatment is called electrochemotherapy (ECT); bleomycin is most often used as the drug for this type of treatment. It was hypothesized that electroporation could be used to augment the cytotoxicity of other anticancer agents. Therefore, this study was performed in order to screen 44 different combinations of drug and cell type in vitro to identify drugs that may have higher cytotoxicity when combined with electroporation. Results from seven cell types indicate that the IC50 of bleomycin can be reduced by a factor of 100-5000 when electroporation is used to facilitate internalization. The IC50 values of cisplatin and carboplatin could be reduced by factors ranging from 3 to 13 in six different cell lines as a result of electroporation. These IC50 reductions in multiple cell lines suggest that cisplatin and carboplatin may be effective in vivo as part of ECT treatment.
11207055	Electroporation of human microvascular endothelial cells: evidence for an anti-vascular mechanism of electrochemotherapy.	Recent studies have indicated that the antitumour effectiveness of electrochemotherapy, a combination of chemotherapeutic drugs with application of high voltage electric pulses applied to the tumour nodule (electroporation), result in a significant reduction in tumour blood flow and may therefore be mediated by an anti-vascular mechanism. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of electroporation with bleomycin or cisplatin on cultured human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). The sensitivity of HMEC-1 cells to a 5 min treatment by electroporation with bleomycin or cisplatin (8 electric pulses, pulse duration 100 micros, frequency 1 Hz, electric field intensity 1400 V x cm(-1)) was compared to the sensitivity of cells treated continuously for 3 days with drugs alone. HMEC-1 cells were moderately sensitive to continuous exposure to cisplatin, but showed greater sensitivity to bleomycin. Combination of a 5 min drug exposure with electric pulses increased cytotoxicity approximately 10-fold for cisplatin and approximately 5000-fold for bleomycin. The electroporation of HMEC-1 cells with bleomycin for a 5 min exposure was approximately 250-fold better than a continuous exposure to the drug alone. The results of this study indicate that the anti-tumour action of electrochemotherapy is likely to be due, in part, to the highly sensitive response of vascular endothelial cells. Further studies are necessary to identify the determinants of endothelial response and its relationship to the anti-vascular action of electrochemotherapy in vivo.
11327800	Gene transfer into cultured mammalian embryos by electroporation.	To gain a better understanding of mammalian development at the molecular level, technology is needed that allows the transfer of exogenous genes into desired embryonic regions at defined stages of development. Our strategy has been to use electroporation (EP) of plasmid DNA following whole-embryo culture (WEC). In our gene transfer system, postimplantation rodent embryos are taken out of the uterus and a purified DNA solution of mammalian expression plasmid constructs is injected into the neural tube. A square-pulse current is delivered using an electroporator with an optimizer. Electroporated embryos are allowed to develop in the WEC system for 24--48 h. Within the targeted area, the proportion of transfected cells varied from 10% to approximately 100% depending on the test conditions (e.g., DNA concentration, voltage, duration of EP, and pulse number). The EP--WEC system has several advantages including rapid gene expression, minimal laboratory work, precisely targeted regions, and no risk for human beings. Application of the method is useful in improving our understanding of early neural development (E7--E12 in mice), e.g., alteration of gene function via ectopic expression, interference with dominant negative proteins, and fate mapping with marker genes. In addition, EP can complement genetic approaches such as the generation of knockout and transgenic mice.
12194203	Conditions for gene transfection into the HL-60 human leukaemia cell line by electroporation.	Electroporation represents a powerful technique for cell transfection; however, its efficiency in haemopoietic cells (approximately 1%) is largely unsatisfactory. Biological processes in haemopoietic cells are often studied using leukaemia cell line HL-60. For this reason we developed conditions for efficiently introducing plasmids to HL-60 cells by electroporation, as an alternative to other techniques. This technique employs the electric pulse (250-270 V; 1000 microF) followed by separation of living cells on a Ficoll-Paque discontinuous gradient. Using 10-20 micrograms of plasmid, we routinely achieve 12-14% of transfectants.
7840968	Optimization of the transfection of human endothelial cells by electroporation.	A method for efficient transfection of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) is presented here. The procedure involves cell synchronization followed by electroporation and allows the detection of the activity of low-strength promoters. Sodium butyrate, added to the culture medium after electroporation, strongly potentiates the transcriptional activity of viral promoters. The method can be successfully applied to analyze the transcriptional activity of different promoters linked to reporter genes or to express foreign genes controlled by viral promoters.
11159443	Quantitative study of electroporation-mediated molecular uptake and cell viability.	Electroporation's use for laboratory transfection and clinical chemotherapy is limited by an incomplete understanding of the effects of electroporation parameters on molecular uptake and cell viability. To address this need, uptake of calcein and viability of DU 145 prostate cancer cells were quantified using flow cytometry for more than 200 different combinations of experimental conditions. The experimental parameters included field strength (0.1-3.3 kV/cm), pulse length (0.05-20 ms), number of pulses (1-10), calcein concentration (10-100 microM), and cell concentration (0.6-23% by volume). These data indicate that neither electrical charge nor energy was a good predictor of electroporation's effects. Instead, both uptake and viability showed a complex dependence on field strength, pulse length, and number of pulses. The effect of cell concentration was explained quantitatively by electric field perturbations caused by neighboring cells. Uptake was shown to vary linearly with external calcein concentration. This large quantitative data set may be used to optimize electroporation protocols, test theoretical models, and guide mechanistic interpretations.
11258623	Improved intracellular delivery of oligonucleotides by square wave electroporation.	Prior studies have shown that electroporation is a simple and effective method for the introduction of oligonucleotides (ODN) into cells. In ex vivo bone marrow purging models, electroporation of ODN into cells has been associated with selective killing of human neoplastic cells while sparing hematopoietic stem cells. Prior studies used conventional electroporation methods (i.e., exponential decay) to introduce ODN into cells. Square wave electroporation allows the delivery of a more defined and regulated electrical pulse and is associated with high transfection efficiencies in a variety of systems. The current study was undertaken to determine whether square wave electroporation was more effective than exponential decay electroporation for the delivery of ODN into hematopoietic cells. Using fluorescein-tagged ODN and K562, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells, higher transfection rates were observed after square wave electroporation. In addition, c-myc antisense ODN were more effective in reducing c-myc protein when introduced by square wave electroporation, as compared with introduction by exponential decay electroporation. Square wave electroporation is thus identified as the optimal method for delivering ODN into hematopoietic cells.
12565999	Single-cell electroporation.	Electroporation is a widely used method for the introduction of polar and charged agents such as dyes, drugs, DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides, and amino acids into cells. Traditionally, electroporation is performed with large electrodes in a batch mode for treatment of a large number of cells in suspension. Recently, microelectrodes that can produce extremely localized electric fields, such as solid carbon fiber microelectrodes, electrolyte-filled capillaries and micropipettes as well as chip-based microfabricated electrode arrays, have proven useful to electroporate single cells and subcellular structures. Single-cell electroporation opens up a new window of opportunities in manipulating the genetic, metabolic, and synthetic contents of single targeted cells in tissue slices, cell cultures, in microfluidic channels or at specific loci on a chip-based device.
14583405	Rapid and efficient electroporation-based gene transfer into primary dissociated neurons.	Non-viral gene transfer into neurons has proved to be a formidable task. Here, we describe an electroporation-based method that allows efficient and reliable DNA transfer into dissociated neural cells before they are plated and cultured. In hippocampal neural cells derived from either neonatal mouse or embryonic chicken brains, a high transfection rate was already observed 5 h after transfection, and reached 40-80% in 24 h, as monitored by expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). The level of eGFP expression per cell depended on the amount of DNA used in a gene transfer experiment. The survival and neuritic length of transfected cells resembled that of non-electroporated cells. The transfected neurons showed normal immunostaining for endogenous synaptic protein synaptophysin and the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Furthermore, efficient gene transfer of the NCAM isoform NCAM140 and eGFP-tagged NCAM140 could be achieved, allowing visualization of NCAM140 expression. Also, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored eGFP could be efficiently expressed, highlighting lipid rafts without altering electrophysiological properties of transfected neurons. When neurons transfected with green and red fluorescent proteins were cocultured, fine details of their interactions could be revealed in time-lapse experiments. Thus, the method provides a useful tool for elucidation of genes involved in different neuronal functions, including neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission.
9866174	Electroporation of, plasmid isolation from and plasmid conservation in Clostridium acetobutylicum DSM 792.	Procedures have been developed allowing recombinant DNA work with Clostridium acetobutylicum DSM 792. Electroporation was used to introduce plasmid DNA into exponentially growing clostridial cells and 6 x 10(2) transformants/microgram DNA could be obtained at a time constant of 5.5 ms, 1.8 kV, 50 microF, and 600 omega. The method also allowed the taxonomic group IV strain NI-4082 to be transformed (10(1) transformants/microgram DNA). Plasmid preparation from recombinant clostridia was optimal when a modification of the alkaline lysis method was employed. It was also important to use cells from the mid-logarithmic growth phase. Recombinant strains could be easily preserved as spore suspensions; under all conditions tested plasmids were maintained.
10677801	Electroporation therapy of solid tumors.	The curative effects of some chemotherapeutic drugs are impeded by their poor permeation through the cell membrane. This limitation can be overcome by a novel approach called electroporation therapy (EPT), electrochemotherapy (ECT), or electrical impulse chemotherapy (EIC). The method involves application of brief electrical pulses, which destabilize the cell membrane barrier, allowing intracellular access of chemotherapeutic drugs that otherwise would not be able to penetrate the cell membrane effectively. EPT makes it possible to lower the drug dose, thereby relieving the patient of adverse side effects associated with conventional chemotherapy. Even with the lower drug dose, EPT has shown significantly higher efficacy than has conventional chemotherapy. The method is currently being evaluated clinically for treating various cancer indications using the anticancer drugs bleomycin or cisplatin. This article provides a historical perspective and current insights into this new modality of cancer treatment, including basic physical, biological, and medical facts about EPT; computer-assisted development of electrical pulse generators and electrodes necessary to create effective electrical fields in the treatment area; results of cancer cell and tumor treatments in vitro, in animals, and in humans; safety aspects of EPT; potential combined delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs and biological agents to reduce or eliminate metastatic disease; and intracellular delivery of DNA by electroporation for cancer gene therapy.
11023903	Characterization of single-cell electroporation by using patch-clamp and fluorescence microscopy.	Electroporation of single NG108-15 cells with carbon-fiber microelectrodes was characterized by patch-clamp recordings and fluorescence microscopy. To minimize adverse capacitive charging effects, the patch-clamp pipette was sealed on the cell at a 90(o) angle with respect to the microelectrodes where the applied potential reaches a minimum. From transmembrane current responses, we determined the electric field strengths necessary for ion-permeable pore formation and investigated the kinetics of pore opening and closing as well as pore open times. From both patch-clamp and fluorescence microscopy experiments, the threshold transmembrane potentials for dielectric breakdown of NG108-15 cells, using 1-ms rectangular waveform pulses, was approximately 250 mV. The electroporation pulse preceded pore formation, and analyte entry into the cells was dictated by concentration, and membrane resting potential driving forces. By stepwise moving a cell out of the focused field while measuring the transmembrane current response during a supramaximal pulse, we show that cells at a distance of approximately 30 microm from the focused field were not permeabilized.
11056788	Case reports: the use of intermaxillary screws to achieve intermaxillary fixation in the treatment of mandibular fractures.	INTRODUCTION: Treatment of mandibular fractures commonly involves the use of arch bars in temporary maxillo-mandibular fixation (also called intermaxillary fixation) to aid bone plating, for the postoperative application of light elastic traction to correct minor occlusal discrepancies and intermaxillary fixation for post reduction immobilisation. The purpose of this paper is to describe a quick and simple alternative for intermaxillary fixation. CLINICAL PICTURE: Three cases of mandibular fractures are presented to demonstrate the use of intermaxillary screws instead of conventional arch-bar wiring. TREATMENT: Two cases were treated with closed reduction methods while the other case was treated with open reduction. OUTCOME: Subsequent fracture healing was not compromised using this technique. CONCLUSIONS: With careful case selection, successful treatment outcome may be achieved using this time-saving and technically simple procedure. Some of the advantages and disadvantages of the intermaxillary screws are discussed.
11248893	Nanoengineered structures for holding and manipulating liposomes and cells.	We describe the fabrication of nanoengineered holding pipets with concave seating surfaces and fine pressure control. These pipets were shown to exhibit exceptional stability in capturing, transporting, and releasing single cells and liposomes 1-12 microm in diameter, which opens previously inaccessible avenues of research. Three specific examples demonstrated the utility and versatility of this manipulation system. In the first, carboxyrhodamine was selectively incorporated into individual cells by electroporation, after which nearly all the medium (hundreds of microliters) surrounding the docked and tagged cells was rapidly exchanged (in seconds) and the cells were subsequently probed by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). In the second study, a single liposome containing carboxyrhodamine was transported to a dye-free solution using a transfer pipet, docked to a holding pipet, and held firmly during physical agitation and interrogation by LIF. In the third study, pairs of liposomes were positioned between two microelectrodes, held in contact, and selectively electrofused and the resulting liposomes undocked intact.
12113527	Analysis of morphogenetic potential of caudal spinal cord in Triturus carnifex adults (Urodele amphibians) subjected to repeated tail amputations.	The present research was aimed at testing whether the extraordinary morphogenetic and histogenetic potential exhibited in the regenerating new tail remains constant even after repeated amputation or whether it changes as a result of the mechanisms responsible for the regenerative process. Particular attention was focused on regeneration of the spinal cord and ganglia. For this purpose, tail regeneration in adult specimens of Triturus carnifex subjected to repeated amputation (up to 7 times) was compared with that of control animals subjected to a single amputation. Results show that although it slowed down the morphogenetic and differentiative phase, repeated amputation did not significantly alter either the morphogenetic or the histogenetic potential of the ependymal layer of the regenerating spinal cord. The latter result leads to hypothesized that the cells of the ependymal layer of the stump, which are responsible for the formation of the apical ampulla and the ependymal tubule inside the regenerative blastema, do not derive from undifferentiated reserve elements triggered after tail amputation but rather from differentiated ependymal elements that dedifferentiate after the trauma and re-acquire embryonic potential. If this regeneration were actually to take place at the expense of the reserve elements, the continual regenerative processes induced by the repeated amputation would lead to the increasing depletion of these elements and a consequent reduction in regenerative capacity.
12175426	A comparison of efficacy and toxicity between electroporation and adenoviral gene transfer.	BACKGROUND: Electroporation of skeletal muscle after injection of naked DNA was shown by others to increase transgene expression. Information regarding tissue damage caused by electroporation is conflicting. It is also not well known how plasmid electroporation compares with transfection by adenoviral vectors. To investigate these questions the most used protocol for muscle electroporation was used, i.e. 8 pulses of 200 V/cm and 20 ms at a frequency of 1 Hz. RESULTS: Intra-muscular DNA transfer of pLuciferase was increased by 2 logs after electroporation, confirming data described by others. However, the blood levels of the encoded protein were still lower than those obtained after injection of first generation adenoviral vectors. Also, the electroporation procedure, on its own, caused severe muscle damage consisting of rhabdomyolysis and infiltration, whereas the adenoviral vectors caused only a slight infiltration. As damage of targeted tissue may be an advantage in the case of tumour transfection, we also compared the two transfection methods in tumour tissue. In case of poorly permissive tumours, adenoviral vectors cannot transfect more than 2% of the tumour tissue without inducing significant liver damage. In contrast, the electroporation seems to offer a wider therapeutic window since it does not cause any systemic toxicity and still induce's significant transfection. CONCLUSIONS: Plasmid electroporation of the muscle induce severe local damage and is of no advantage over adenoviral vectors for obtaining high blood levels of a vector encoded protein. In contrast, electroporation of tumours might be safer than adenoviral gene transfer.
12483315	Electroporation of primary neural cultures: a simple method for directed gene transfer in vitro.	Gene transfer into cells of the nervous system is an important method to analyze tissue-specific gene functions. Although highest transfection efficiencies are generally obtained by viral gene transfer, non-viral methods are attractive because they are less labor intensive and more suitable for high throughput screening approaches. Here we describe an approach for electroporation-based gene transfer into primary neural cells isolated from dissociated murine cerebella. Using GFP as reporter molecule, we show that electroporation allows for efficient gene transfer into embryonic and postnatal neural cells under highly controlled experimental conditions. Furthermore we show that adaptation of electroporation parameters allowed for the preferential transfection of subsets of neural cells within the mixed primary culture. Using electroporation settings of high voltage and low capacitance (500 V/50 microF) we achieved a transfection efficiency of about 10% of small neural cells which were identified as granule cells by the expression of the granule cell-specific marker NeuN. At electroporation settings of 220 V/975 microF, large and stellate-shaped cells that comprised about 10% of the GFAP-positive population of astrocytes were preferentially transfected. We conclude that electroporation of primary neural cells can be used to target gene transfer to subsets of neural cells.
12736680	Controlled vesicle deformation and lysis by single oscillating bubbles.	The ability of collapsing (cavitating) bubbles to focus and concentrate energy, forces and stresses is at the root of phenomena such as cavitation damage, sonochemistry or sonoluminescence. In a biomedical context, ultrasound-driven microbubbles have been used to enhance contrast in ultrasonic images. The observation of bubble-enhanced sonoporation--acoustically induced rupture of membranes--has also opened up intriguing possibilities for the therapeutic application of sonoporation as an alternative to cell-wall permeation techniques such as electroporation and particle guns. However, these pioneering experiments have not been able to pinpoint the mechanism by which the violently collapsing bubble opens pores or larger holes in membranes. Here we present an experiment in which gentle (linear) bubble oscillations are sufficient to achieve rupture of lipid membranes. In this regime, the bubble dynamics and the ensuing sonoporation can be accurately controlled. The use of microbubbles as focusing agents makes acoustics on the micrometre scale (microacoustics) a viable tool, with possible applications in cell manipulation and cell-wall permeation as well as in microfluidic devices.
7880860	Observation of extremely heterogeneous electroporative molecular uptake by Saccharomyces cerevisiae which changes with electric field pulse amplitude.	Molecular uptake of a charged fluorescent molecule (calcein; 623 Da, z = -4) was quantitatively determined at the single cell level using flow cytometry. Dilutely suspended cells were exposed to one exponential pulse (tau p approximately 300 microseconds) for different field strength values. For an asymmetric cell such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae a significant variation in the number of molecules taken up by individual cells was expected for physical reasons. By carrying out several thousand individual cell measurements for each pulse condition, we found that the number of molecules per cell varies significantly within the cell population, and that this population distribution changes markedly as the field strength is varied. Surprisingly, in spite of significant changes in this distribution with field strength, the average uptake per cell reaches a non-equilibrium plateau for which the uptake per cell is much smaller than the product of the mean cell volume and the supplied extracellular concentration. These observations of different field-dependent cell population distributions of uptake support the hypotheses that (1) electroporation is a transmembrane voltage-responsive phenomenon, so that cells of different sizes, shapes and orientation, respond differently to even a spatially uniform applied field, (2) population average measurements of electroporation behavior can be incomplete and misleading, and (3) transport of small charged molecules is due to electrophoresis through the pores of a dynamically changing pore population.
8308427	The doorstop procedure. A technique for treating unstable fracture dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal joint.	The unstable fracture dislocation of the proximal interphalangeal joint remains a difficult injury to manage despite the availability of a wide variety of treatment options. We describe a simple alternative method of treatment called the doorstop procedure.
9460055	Changes in the electrical properties of the skin outermost layer during pulse electrotreatment.	The kinetics of changes in the electric current I(t) passing through human skin samples of full thickness in vitro during rectangular voltage pulses (amplitude, 10-60 V; duration, 5-8 ms) was investigated. The function I(t) was shown to rapidly decrease, to pass through its minimum, and then to increase slowly. With the increase in voltage, the minimal current grew; the dropping branch became less pronounced (up to its complete disappearance at 40 V); and the position of the minimum shifted to short times. All these features of the current response were explained in the assumption that the electrical properties of the skin at a voltage less than 30 V are determined by macropores of skin appendages (hair follicles, sweat glands, etc.). The dropping branch of the current was a superposition of the charging current of the macropore wall capacity and the conductive current through the electroporated walls. At voltages over 30 V, increases in current and conductivity are determined by electroporation of the lipid-corneocyte matrix of the skin outermost layer (stratum corneum). The kinetics of skin resistance restoration after pulse electrotreatment was also investigated. The characteristic time of restoration, which did not exceed 1 min at 10 V, increased up to dozens of minutes at voltages above 30 V. The investigated phenomena were found to be very much similar to the electroporation of plane lipid bilayers and plasma membranes of isolated cells.
9482256	Transient transfection of oligodendrocyte progenitors by electroporation.	The transient transfection of transgenes into oligodendrocytes offers an important tool for studying the function of proteins during myelin formation. Currently established procedures, however, have generally resulted in low survival rates and low levels of uptake of the transgene into primary oligodendrocyte progenitors. We describe an electroporation method which yields transient transfection of oligodendrocyte progenitors of up to 10-15% of the surviving cells, and provides approximately 10(4) surviving, transfected cells per electroporation reaction. In recent applications transgene expression persisted as the transfected progenitors progressed through subsequent stages of the oligodendrocyte lineage. This technique is expected to facilitate the study of the function of key proteins and lipids during the development of primary cultured oligodendrocytes.
9694712	Cytochrome c induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in intact hematopoietic cells and overrides apoptosis suppression mediated by bcl-2, growth factor signaling, MAP-kinase-kinase, and malignant change.	It has been shown that cytochrome c is released from mitochondria during apoptosis, activates pro-caspase CPP32 (caspase III), and induces DNA fragmentation in mixtures of cytosolic extracts and isolated nuclei. To establish whether cytochrome c can primarily induce apoptosis in intact cells, we used direct electroporation of cytochrome c into murine interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent cells. Electroporation of micromolar external concentrations of cytochrome c rapidly induced apoptosis (2 to 4 hours) that was concentration-dependent, did not affect mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and was independent of cell growth. Only certain isoforms of cytochrome c were apoptogenic; yeast cytochrome c and other redox proteins were inactive. Cytochrome c-induced apoptosis was dependent on heme attachment to the apo-enzyme and was completely abolished by caspase inhibitors. Nonapoptogenic isoforms of cytochrome c did not compete for apoptogenic cytochrome c. Although apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal was inhibited by bcl-2 overexpression and expression of an activated MAP-kinase-kinase (MAP-KK), cytochrome c induced apoptosis in the presence of IL-3 signaling, bcl-2 over-expression, expression of activated MAP-KK, and the combined antiapoptotic action of all three. Cytochrome c also induced apoptosis in the leukemic cell line WEHI 3b. However, human HL60 and CEM cells were resistant to cytochrome c-induced apoptosis. HL60 cells did not electroporate, but CEM cells were efficiently electroporated. Our studies with IL-3-dependent cells confirm that the apoptogenic attributes of cytochrome c are identical in intact cells to those in cell extracts. We conclude that cytochrome c can be a prime initiator of apoptosis in intact growing cells and acts downstream of bcl-2 and mitochondria, but that other cells are resistant to its apoptogenic activity. The system described offers a novel, simple approach for investigating regulation of apoptosis by cytochrome c and provides a model linking growth factor signaling to metabolism, survival, and apoptosis control.
11536285	Intracellular effect of ultrashort electrical pulses.	A simple electrical model for biological cells predicts an increasing probability for electric field interactions with cell substructures of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells when the electric pulse duration is reduced into the sub-microsecond range. The validity of this hypothesis was verified experimentally by applying electrical pulses with electric field intensities of up to 5.3 MV/m to human eosinophils in vitro. When 3-5 pulses of 60 ns duration were applied to human eosinophils, intracellular granules were modified without permanent disruption of the plasma membrane. In spite of the extreme electrical power levels applied to the cells thermal effects could be neglected because of the ultrashort pulse duration. The intracellular effect extends conventional electroporation to cellular substructures and opens the potential for new applications in apoptosis induction, gene delivery to the nucleus, or altered cell functions, depending on the electrical pulse conditions.
11575795	Electroporation of single cells and tissues with an electrolyte-filled capillary.	We show how an electrolyte-filled capillary (EFC) coupled to a high-voltage power supply can be used as a versatile electroporation tool for the delivery of dyes, drugs, and biomolecules to the cytoplasm of single cells and cells in tissues. A large-voltage pulse applied across the EFC (fused silica, 30 cm long, 375-microm o.d., 30-microm i.d.) gives rise to a small electric field outside the terminus of the EFC, which causes pore formation in cell membranes and induces an electroosmotic flow of electrolyte. When the EFC contains cell-loading agents, then the electroosmotic flow delivers the agents at the site of pore formation. The combination of pore formation and delivery enables loading of materials into the cytoplasm. By patch-clamp and fluorescence microscopy, formation of pores was observed at estimated transmembrane voltages of <85 mV with half-maximum values around 206 mV. The electroporation protocol was demonstrated by introduction of fluorogenic dyes into single NG108-15 cells, cellular processes, and small populations of cells in organotypic hippocampal cultures. Preliminary results are shown in which this protocol was employed for in vivo electroporation of ventral mesencephalon in rat brains. The technique was also used to access organelle-based detection systems inside cells. As a demonstration, 1,4,5-inositoltriphosphate was added to the electrolyte and detected by intracellular organelles in electroporated cells.
11833774	Electroporated intact BY-2 tobacco culture cells as a model of transient expression study.	Transfer of foreign genes into plant cells can be accomplished by several methods: agrobacterium-mediated, microinjection, biolistic particle bombardment and electroporation. The last one is frequently used for transfection of plant protoplasts for transient gene expression. Electroporation is a simple procedure and allows transfecting a large number of cells at one time. Square wave-modulated porators are the most efficient for introducing expression cassettes into plant protoplasts. Based on a protocol developed by Wu & Feng (Plant Cell Reports, 1999, 18, 381-386), we optimized conditions for transfection of intact Nicotiana tabacum BY-2 cells using square wave-modulated electroporator. To simplify screening for transfected gene expression we used constructs with a GFP marker gene.
11929609	Selective delivery of secretory cargo in Golgi-derived carriers of nonepithelial cells.	In epithelial cells, soluble cargo proteins destined for basolateral or apical secretion are packaged into distinct trans-Golgi network-derived transport carriers. Similar carriers, termed basolateral- and apical-like, have been observed in nonepithelial cells using ectopically expressed membrane marker proteins. Whether these cells are capable of selectively packaging secretory proteins into distinct carriers is still an open question. Here, we have addressed this issue by analyzing the packaging and transport of secretory human chromogranin B fusion proteins using a green fluorescent protein-based high-resolution, dual-color imaging technique. We were able to show that these secretory markers were selectively packaged at the Golgi into tubular/vesicular-like transport carriers containing basolateral membrane markers, resulting in extensive cotransport. In contrast, deletion mutants of the human chromogranin B fusion proteins lacking an N-terminal loop structure were efficiently transported in both basolateral- and apical-like carriers, the latter displaying a spherical morphology. Similarly, in polarized epithelial cells, the human chromogranin B fusion protein was secreted basolaterally and the loop-deleted analogue into both the basolateral and apical medium. These findings suggest that nonepithelial cells, like their epithelial counterparts, possess a sorting machinery capable of selective packaging of secretory cargo into distinct types of carriers.
12140740	Electric gene transfer to the liver following systemic administration of plasmid DNA.	Recently, there has been an increasing level of interest in electroporation for gene delivery due to the site-specific nature of the delivery, as well as the high efficiency of the method. Electroporation involves the application of a pulsed electric field to cells to enhance cell permeability, resulting in the transit of exogenous polynucleotide across the cytoplasmic membrane. Electroporation is traditionally performed by locally injecting DNA to the site of interest followed by the application of electric field. Compared with the local injection of plasmid DNA to the liver, systemic injection has the advantage of delivering genes to more hepatocytes. We describe here a method for efficient gene transfer to the liver by electroporation following tail vein administration of the naked DNA. The cells expressing the reporter gene are more broadly distributed with this systemic injection, as compared with direct injection.
12147133	In vivo electroporation for genetic manipulations of whole Hydra polyps.	In vivo electroporation is used to study gene regulation and gene function in the freshwater polyp Hydra. Although this approach has been used successfully by several investigators, efficacy and handling continue to present a problem. Here we show technical aspects of in vivo electroporation for introducing fluorescent dyes, plasmid DNA and double stranded RNA into Hydra polyps. We describe the fundamentals of the electroporation delivery system, discuss recent studies where this approach has been used successfully, compare it to alternative transfection methods such as lipofection, and identify future directions.
7866872	Genetic transformation of plants by protoplast electroporation.	This article describes an optimized protocol for the electroporation of tobacco mesophyll protoplasts together with notes and data on the effects of various parameters and suggestions for work with protoplasts of other species. In this protocol, electroporation is achieved by means of electrical pulses from a high-voltage, capacitive-discharge unit. Procedures are described for measurement of protoplast viability with Evan's blue, the detection of transient expression of CAT and GUS gene plasmid constructs, and for the recovery of stable transformants based on selection for kanamycin resistance.
8738419	Functional characterization of the hepatic sodium-dependent taurocholate transporter stably transfected into an immortalized liver-derived cell line and V79 fibroblasts.	"Bile acids are taken up into liver parenchymal cells by active, carrier-mediated transport. This transport is lost during cell transformation in permanent growing liver tumor cell lines. In order to establish bile acid uptake in a permanent mammalian cell culture system, we transfected the cDNA from the cloned rat liver Na(+)-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp) in Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (V79 cells) and in a ""hepatocyte-like"" cell line HPCT-1F3 with three different gene transfer methods (calcium phosphate precipitation, lipofection, electroporation). A stable integration of the cDNA in both cell genomes was observed. However, in V79 fibroblasts, a permanent functional expression of taurocholate transport was not achieved. The sodium-dependent uptake of taurocholate was expressed permanently only in HPCT-1E3 cells, if the Ntcp was transfected by electroporation. In this cell line (HPCT-1E3-TC-6/2), substrate specificity, sodium- and energy dependence, as well as the kinetic parameters of the transfected single transporter were measured. The sodium-dependent taurocholate uptake was inhibited by addition of non-labeled bile acids, bumetanide, sulfobromophthalein and oligomycin. Pretreatment with 10 mM Na(+)-butyrate of this cell culture for 22 h stimulated taurocholate uptake twofold. Neither butyrate-stimulated cells nor unstimulated cells transport glycocholate or cholate. Besides taurocholate a fluorescence-labeled taurocholate derivative, NBD-taurocholate, was taken up by the HPCT-1E3-TC cells. In conclusion, the specific gene transfer with the electroporation technique in combination with the ""right"" cell line, HPCT-1E3, has been successful for the permanent and functional expression of the Ntcp. This allowed direct monitoring of the solitary sodium-dependent taurocholate transport system in a ""liver cell-like"" environment."
9563509	Direct gene transfer into rat liver cells by in vivo electroporation.	In vivo electro-transfection efficiency and manner of transferred gene expression were investigated by fluorescence microscopic image analysis. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene was used as the genetic marker. Electroporation was carried out on the liver of live rats by use of disk electrodes mounted in the tips of tweezers, which were directly pressed onto the surface of a liver lobe in situ. Electroporation with eight electric pulses of 50 ms in duration at 50 V gave a good efficiency of transfection as judged by the induced GFP expression. Bright fluorescence of GFP appeared as dots, which were scattered around the area damaged by electroporation. The transfection efficiency increased as the amount of injected DNA was increased. The results indicate that the amount of induced gene expression can be controlled. Estimation of the efficiency of electro-gene transfer using the fluorescence of GFP and digital analysis of microscopic images was useful to determine the optimum conditions for local gene therapy in tissues and organs.
9845104	Electroporation increases the effect of borocaptate (10B-BSH) in neutron capture therapy.	PURPOSE: The cell membrane permeability of borocaptate (10B-BSH) and its extent of accumulation in cells are controversial. This study was performed to elucidate these points. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two different treatments were applied to SCCVII tumor cells. The first group of tumor cells was incubated in culture medium with 10B-BSH or 10B-enriched boric acid, and was exposed to neutrons from the heavy water facility of the Kyoto University Reactor (KUR). More than 99% of neutrons were thermal neutrons at flux base. The second group was pretreated by electroporation in combination with 10B-BSH, and thereafter the cells were irradiated with neutrons. The cell killing effects of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) using BSH were investigated by colony formation assay. RESULTS: Surviving cell fraction decreased exponentially with neutron fluence, and addition of BSH significantly enhanced the cell killing effect of neutron capture therapy (NCT) depending on 10B concentration. The effect of BSH-BNCT also increased with preincubation time of cells in the medium containing BSH. The electroporation of cells with BSH at 10 ppm 10B markedly enhanced BSH-BNCT effects in comparison with that of preincubation alone. The effect of BSH-BNCT with electroporation was equal to that of BNCT using 10B-boric acid at a same 10B concentration (10 ppm). CONCLUSIONS: BSH is suggested to penetrate the cells slowly and remained after washing. Electroporation can introduce BSH into the cells very efficiently, and BSH stays in the cells and is not lost by washing. Therefore, if electroporation is applied to tumors after BSH injection, 10B remains in tumors but is cleared from normal tissues, and selective accumulation of 10B in tumors will be achieved after an adequate waiting time.
9882905	[Augmentation phalloplasty according to the G. Tritto technique].	"We describe the augmentation phalloplasty according to G. Tritto technique. The procedure is based on the use of dermo-fat free graft taken from the cruro-gluteal area and allows a penile lengthening varying from 2.5 to 3 cm. This technique can be performed in patients with the so-called ""small penises"" and psychosexual dysfunctions."
10356882	Electroporation therapy: a new approach for the treatment of head and neck cancer.	Electroporation can deliver exogenous molecules like drugs and genes into cells by pulsed electric fields through a temporary increase in cell membrane permeability. This effect is being used for the treatment of cancer by intratumoral injection of low dosage of an otherwise marginally effective chemotherapeutic drug, bleomycin. Application of a pulsed electric field results in substantially higher uptake of the drug and enhanced killing of the cancer cells than is possible by conventional methods. The MedPulser, a new treatment system for local electroporation therapy (EPT) of head and neck tumors was developed and is described in this paper. EPT with bleomycin has been found to be very effective in killing cancer cells in vitro, in mouse tumor xenografts in vivo, and in tumors in humans. Ten head and neck cancer patients with recurring or unresponsive tumors were enrolled in a Phase I/II clinical trial. Treatment of the entire tumor mass in each of eight patients resulted in five complete responses confirmed by biopsy and MRI, and three partial responses (> or = 50% shrinkage). Two additional patients who received partial treatment of their tumor mass had local response where treated, but no overall lesion remission. Duration of the complete responses ranges from 2-10 months to date. All patients tolerated the treatment well with no significant local or systemic adverse effects.
11251180	Combinatory anti-tumor effects of electroporation-mediated chemotherapy and wild-type p53 gene transfer to human esophageal cancer cells.	Delivery of electric pulses to an established solid tumor augments the permeability of cell membrane and increases the susceptibility of tumors to an anti-cancer agent that is administered in the vicinity of tumors. Forced expression of the wild-type p53 gene in tumor cells that have non-functional p53 gene(s) can also enhance their sensitivity to a DNA-damaging agent. To investigate the feasibility of electroporation-mediated therapy for cancer, electric pulses were delivered to human esophageal tumors developed in nude mice after they received an anti-cancer agent and/or plasmid DNA containing the wild-type p53 gene. The growth of esophageal tumors was suppressed with electroporation-mediated chemotherapy compared with the treatment with an anti-cancer agent or electroporation alone. Intratumoral injection of the wild-type p53 gene into p53-mutated esophageal tumors followed by electroporation also inhibited tumor growth. When mice were administered with the wild-type p53 gene and an anti-cancer agent, subsequent electroporation produced a synergistic therapeutic effect. Combinatory transfer of plasmid DNA and a pharmacological agent by electroporation is thereby a possible therapeutic strategy for the treatment of solid tumors.
11593359	Prediction and optimization of gene transfection and drug delivery by electroporation.	Although electroporation is widely used for laboratory gene transfection and gaining increased importance for nonviral gene therapy, it is generally employed using trial-and-error optimization schemes for lack of methods to predict electroporation's effects on cells. Therefore, we used a statistical approach to quantitatively predict molecular uptake and cell viability following electroporation and show that it predicts both in vitro and in vivo results for a wide range of molecules, including DNA, in 60 different cell types. Mechanistically, this broad predictive ability suggests that electroporation is mediated primarily by lipid bilayer structure and only secondarily by cell-specific characteristics. For gene therapy applications, this approach should facilitate rational design of electroporation protocols.
11835671	High-efficiency gene transfer into adult fish: a new tool to study fin regeneration.	"Zebrafish represents an excellent model to study the function of vertebrate genes (e.g., well-developed genetics, large number of mutants, and genomic sequencing in progress), inasmuch as we have tools to manipulate gene expression. Recent use of injected morpholinos in eggs provides a good method to "" knockdown "" gene expression in early development (Nasevicius and Ekker, 2000), and the ""caged"" RNA injected in eggs allows to overexpress a gene in a specific set of cells (Ando et al., 2001). However, a method to specifically modify gene expression in the juvenile or in the adult is still missing. Such a method would be a very powerful tool to understand gene function in differentiated tissues. We describe here an electroporation-based approach, which allows gene transfer in adult tissues. Its efficiency was assessed using a GFP (green fluorescent protein) dependent assay. We then used this method to disrupt the Fgf signalling pathway during the process of regeneration."
11907835	Single-cell electroporation.	Using modified patch-clamp methodology, we demonstrated that it is possible to insert genes or other compounds routinely into single cells by electroporation. When the cell is indented by a small-tipped microelectrode, a voltage of 10 V or less in the pipette is divided by the pipette resistance and the series resistance of the cleft between the pipette tip and the cell surface. The voltage at the cell membrane can be high enough to cause localized dielectric breakdown of the membrane and create pores that allow compounds in the pipette to enter the cell. Rectangular pulses from 20 micros to more than 300 ms are effective, as are frequencies from DC to 5 kHz. The most significant parameter was the total time for which the voltage was applied. Pipette voltages of 2-10 V were required, with larger genes requiring larger voltages. With optimal parameters, transfection rates in excess of 80% were also possible routinely. This approach offers an effective alternative to intracellular pressure injection and iontophoresis for placing genes, drugs, and other compounds in cells. Because of the small size of the electrode tips, substances can be inserted in cells from almost any location on their surfaces. In addition, the small tips electroporated only a limited area and so did little cell damage.
7484469	"A ""bicycle-handlebar"" type of incision for primary and secondary abdominoplasty."	The authors register a revision of the literature regarding the types of low transversal pubic incisions used in abdominoplasty. Since 1987, the traditional open W-type incision changed to a new type called the bicycle handlebar. In this procedure, the pubic segment remains in a lower line at the level of the pubic hair, while the lateral limbs are in a high position. The anterior superior iliac spine is used as reference. Different types of procedures where the umbilical skin hole reaches the pubic incision are described and illustrated. This procedure is also used in secondary abdominoplasty. In all cases, the incision's new position should remain hidden under a bathing suit.
7756542	Mechanism of electroinduced ionic species transport through a multilamellar lipid system.	"A theoretical model for electroporation of multilamellar lipid system due to a series of large electrical pulses is presented and then used to predict the functional dependence of the transport of charged molecules. Previously, electroporation has been considered only for single bilayer systems such as artificial planar bilayer membranes and cell membranes. The former have been extensively studied with respect to electrical and mechanical behavior, and the latter with respect to molecular transport. Recent experimental results for both molecular transport and electrical resistance changes in the stratum corneum (SC) suggest that electroporation also occurs in the multilamellar lipid membranes of the SC. In addition, there is the possibility that other skin structures (the ""appendages"") also experience electroporation. A compartment model is introduced to describe the transport of charged species across the SC, and the predicted dependence is compared with available data. In this model, the SC is assumed to contain many hydrophilic compartments in series separated by boundary bilayers, so that these compartments become connected only upon electroporation. Two limiting cases for the transport of charged molecules are considered: (1) transport along tortuous inter-bilayer pathways in each compartment, followed by transport across individual boundary bilayers due to electroporation, and (2) transport along straight-through pathways in the boundary bilayers with fast mixing in each compartment, which includes the interior space of corneocytes. Both models were fitted to the experimental data. The large electropore radius (rt approximately 200 A) and porated fractional area (ft approximately 10(-3) obtained from the fitting for the tortuous model relative to the more reasonable values obtained for the straight-through model (rs approximately 4 A, fs approximately 10(-6) suggest that the latter is a more realistic description of electroinduced transport of ionized species through the skin."
8034986	Differentiation of cytotoxicity using target cells labelled with europium and samarium by electroporation.	We report the simultaneous use of europium-DTPA (Eu-DTPA) and samarium-DTPA (Sm-DTPA) in cytotoxicity experiments to analyze simultaneously LAK and NK cell lysis and to differentiate between specific target lysis and bystander killing. The target cells were either labelled with Eu-DTPA or Sm-DTPA chelates by electroporation, which permits the use of target cell lines or primary leukemic B cells (B-CLL) that cannot be labelled by the conventional dextran-sulphate method. The release of europium and samarium reaches a maximum at comparable time intervals (2-3 h). Due to the shorter counting interval within the samarium window the labelling efficiency is about ten times less efficient compared to europium. Using europium as label for the LAK target Daudi and samarium as label for the NK sensitive cell line K562 the differentiation of LAK versus NK activity can be performed in a single culture assay. Also, the killing of B cells and bystander cells by cytotoxic T cells was analyzed in a system where T cells were redirected to B cells through CD3 x CD19 bispecific antibodies. In fact, no bystander killing was noted when bispecific antibodies were used to bridge cytotoxic T cells to the B cells. This approach provides a simple non-radioactive method for evaluating cytotoxicity against two different cells in a single culture well.
8660372	Electroporation of small RNAs into plant protoplasts: mitochondrial uptake of transfer RNAs.	To study tRNA import into plant mitochondria, we have set up a system to follow the fate in vivo of tRNA transcripts introduced into plant protoplasts by electroporation. Conditions were optimized for maximum tRNA uptake into potato protoplasts. We have shown that in vitro synthesized tRNA transcripts are poor substrates due to rapid degradation leading to low efficiencies of transfer and short life in protoplasts. Labelled natural tRNAs were more efficiently electroporated into protoplasts and they remained stable during protoplast culture. We have observed import into mitochondria of total and purified cytosolic tRNAs in protoplasts but the process was not specific for the tRNA species which are normally imported.
8908481	Isolation and characterization of transposon Tn4001-generated, cytadherence-deficient transformants of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma genitalium.	Cytadherence and subsequent parasitism of host cells by the human pathogens, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma genitalium, are mediated by adhesins and adherence-related accessory proteins. In this report we demonstrate the use of transposon Tn4001 to generate Tn-induced transformants displaying cytadherence-deficient characteristics. Mycoplasma pneumoniae Tn-generated transformant, designated 8R, lacked the high-molecular weight adherence-accessory proteins HMW1/4 and was deficient in hemadsorption and cytadherence capabilities. In transformant 8R, Tn4001 was not localized in or near the hmw1 gene or in the upstream adhesin (p30/hmw3) locus, suggesting an alternate site associated with the regulation of hmw1 gene expression. Sequence analysis identified the transposon insertion site at the crl locus previously reported, although the protein characteristics of transformant 8R differed from the earlier described transformants. The M. genitalium Tn-transformant, designated G26, was also defective in hemadsorption and cytadherence. However, transformant G26 synthesized adhesins P140 and P32 suggesting that Tn4001 transposed into a new gene or site previously unlinked to cytadherence, namely ORF MG032. This study demonstrates the utility of Tn4001 mutagenesis for both M. pneumoniae and M. genitalium which, in the latter case, has special relevance in light of the recent complete characterization of its continuous total genomic sequence.
9253793	Electrical permeabilization of rat luteal cells: in situ phosphorylation of endogenous protein.	Progesterone synthesis in the corpus luteum is regulated primarily by luteinizing hormone which acts via the adenylate cyclase/cyclic AMP/protein kinase A signalling cascade. Protein phosphorylation therefore plays a key role in the regulation of steroidogenesis, but there are relatively few studies of the in situ phosphorylation of luteal cell substrates. This may in part reflect the difficulties inherent in measuring changes in protein phosphorylation in intact cells preloaded with 32P and difficulties in interpreting data obtained using broken cell preparations. We have now applied a method of stable permeabilization of luteal cell plasma membranes by exposure of cell populations to a high intensity electric field. Under optimum conditions (5 kV/cm, six discharges) electrical permeabilization reproducibly produced populations of luteal cells in which 70-80% of the cells were permeabilized, as assessed by Trypan blue exclusion and [14C] sucrose space measurements. Pores were stable for at least 1 h, and there were no ultrastructural changes to the cells that could be detected by transmission electron microscopy. Permeabilized cells showed rapid cyclic AMP-induced changes in phosphorylation of endogenous proteins when provided with [gamma - 32 P] ATP. Our results demonstrate that the electricity permeabilized luteal cell offers a useful model for studying intracellular events in steroidogenic stimulus-response coupling cascades.
9794503	Localization of a FITC-labeled phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide in the skin after topical delivery by iontophoresis and electroporation.	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to verify the hypothesis that the application of high voltage to the skin enhances both stratum corneum and keratinocyte permeability. Therefore, the transport of FITC labelled phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (FITC-PS) administered by passive diffusion, iontophoresis or electroporation was localized. METHODS: Fluorescent microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy were used to visualize the FITC-PS transport at the tissue and cell level respectively in hairless rat skin after electroporation (5 x (200 V approximately 500 ms) or iontophoresis (same amount of charges transferred). RESULTS: FITC-PS did not penetrate the viable skin by passive diffusion. Molecular transport in the skin upon electroporation or iontophoresis was localized and implied mainly hair follicles for iontophoresis. In the stratum corneum, the pathways for FITC-PS transport were more transcellular during electroporation and paracellular during iontophoresis. FITC-PS were detected in the nucleus of the keratinocytes a few minutes after pulsing. In contrast, iontophoresis did not lead to an uptake of the oligomer. CONCLUSIONS: The internalization of FITC-PS in the keratinocytes after electroporation confirms the hypothesis and suggests that electroporation, which allows both efficient topical delivery and rapid cellular uptake of the oligonucleotides, might be useful for antisense therapy of epidermal diseases.
11313817	Intramuscular electroporation delivery of IFN-alpha gene therapy for inhibition of tumor growth located at a distant site.	Although electroporation has been shown in recent years to be a powerful method for delivering genes to muscle, no gene therapy via electro-injection has been studied for the treatment of tumors. In an immunocompetent tumor-bearing murine model, we have found that delivery of a low dose of reporter gene DNA (10 microg) to muscle via electroporation under specific pulse conditions (two 25-ms pulses of 375 V/cm) increased the level of gene expression by two logs of magnitude. Moreover, administration of 10 microg of interferon (IFN)-alpha DNA plasmid using these parameters once a week for 3 weeks increased the survival time and reduced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) growth at a distant site in the C3H/HeJ-immunocompetent mouse. IFN-alpha gene therapy delivered to muscle using electroporation demonstrated statistically significant (P < 0.05) therapeutic efficacy for treating SCC located at a distant site, compared with interleukin (IL)-2 or endostatin gene, also delivered by electro-injection. The increased therapeutic efficacy was associated with a high level and extended duration of IFN-alpha expression in muscle and serum. We also discovered that the high level of IFN-alpha expression correlated with increased expression levels of the antiangiogenic genes IP-10 and Mig in local tumor tissue, which may have led to the reduction of blood vessels observed at the local tumor site. Delivery of increasing doses (10-100 microg) of IFN-alpha plasmid DNA by injection alone did not increase antitumor activity, whereas electroporation delivery of increasing doses (10-40 microg) of IFN-alpha plasmid DNA did increase the survival time. Our data clearly demonstrate the potential utility of electroporation for delivery of gene therapy to muscle for the treatment of residual or disseminated tumors.
12091443	Rescue of axotomized retinal ganglion cells by BDNF gene electroporation in adult rats.	PURPOSE: To determine whether the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene can be transfected into retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) by electroporation and whether axotomized RGCs can be rescued after transfection by BDNF in adult rats. METHODS: Mouse BDNF cDNA was injected intravitreally followed by in vivo electroporation in adult rats. The expression of BDNF in RGCs was confirmed by Western immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemistry. After introduction of BDNF cDNA, the survival of axotomized RGCs was estimated by the TdT-dUTP terminal nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method and measured by counting the number of RGCs that were labeled retrogradely by 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyamine percholorate (diI) applied to the superior colliculus (SC). RESULTS: Eyes with injection of the BDNF gene followed by in vivo electroporation showed a significantly higher level of expression of BDNF in the RGC layer, a higher rescue ratio, and a lower number of TUNEL-positive cells than the control samples. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that electroporation is an effective method for the direct delivery of genes into RGCs, and that the BDNF gene transferred into RGCs by in vivo electroporation can protect axotomized RGCs against apoptosis.
10329166	The role of scaffolding proteins in the assembly of the small, single-stranded DNA virus phiX174.	"An empty precursor particle called the procapsid is formed during assembly of the single-stranded DNA bacteriophage phiX174. Assembly of the phiX174 procapsid requires the presence of the two scaffolding proteins, D and B, which are structural components of the procapsid, but are not found in the mature virion. The X-ray crystallographic structure of a ""closed"" procapsid particle has been determined to 3.5 A resolution. This structure has an external scaffold made from 240 copies of protein D, 60 copies of the internally located B protein, and contains 60 copies of each of the viral structural proteins F and G, which comprise the shell and the 5-fold spikes, respectively. The F capsid protein has a similar conformation to that seen in the mature virion, and differs from the previously determined 25 A resolution electron microscopic reconstruction of the ""open"" procapsid, in which the F protein has a different conformation. The D scaffolding protein has a predominantly alpha-helical fold and displays remarkable conformational variability. We report here an improved and refined structure of the closed procapsid and describe in some detail the differences between the four independent D scaffolding proteins per icosahedral asymmetric unit, as well as their interaction with the F capsid protein. We re-analyze and correct the comparison of the closed procapsid with the previously determined cryo-electron microscopic image reconstruction of the open procapsid and discuss the major structural rearrangements that must occur during assembly. A model is proposed in which the D proteins direct the assembly process by sequential binding and conformational switching."
11002264	Assessment of electroporation by flow cytometry.	BACKGROUND: Electroporation accomplishes transient permeabilization of cells and thus aids in the uptake of drugs. The method has been employed clinically in the treatment of dermatological tumors with bleomycin. The conditions of electroporation are still largely empirical and information is lacking as to the interrelationships among voltage pulse height, pulse number and toxicity, cell permeation, drug uptake, and effects on drug toxicity. We used propidium iodide (PI) and flow cytometry to define cell permeation into cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments to determine the improvements of drug toxicity that can be accomplished by electroporation. METHODS: Human squamous carcinoma cells of defined TP53 status and normal human epithelial cells were subjected to electroporation using a square wave pulse generator in the range of 0-5,000 V/cm. Flow cytometry served to establish entry of the drug reporter, PI, into the cytoplasm and nucleus. A dye staining method served to establish cell survival and to determine the toxicity of bleomycin alone, electroporation alone, and electroporation with bleomycin. RESULTS: The electric field intensity (EFI) required to produce 50% permeabilization (EP(50)) is cell type dependent. The EP(50) varied from 1,465 to 2,027 V/cm. An EFI below 900 V/cm is growth stimulatory whereas an EFI in excess of 1,000 V/cm is growth inhibitory. An EFI of 1,000 V/cm is sufficient to increase bleomycin toxicity by a factor of 2-3. A differential electroporation efficiency is observed between normal and tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor cells can be targeted preferentially at electroporation voltages where normal cells are less permeable.
11198481	Efficient palliation of haemorrhaging malignant melanoma skin metastases by electrochemotherapy.	Electric pulses can cause transient permeabilization of cell membranes (electroporation) and this can be utilized to increase the uptake of chemotherapy (electrochemotherapy). Preclinical studies have shown that in vivo electroporation causes transient shut down of blood flow both in normal and, in particular, malignant tissues. We report the successful palliation of a malignant melanoma patient with bleeding skin metastases using electrochemotherapy. In an on-going study of combined electrochemotherapy and low dose interleukin-2, one patient with bleeding skin metastases was included. Nine skin metastases, of which seven were ulcerated, were treated. After intratumoral bleomycin injection, needle electrodes with two arrays 4 mm apart were inserted into the tumours. Eight square wave electric pulses each 99 micros in duration and with an applied voltage to electrode distance ratio of 1.2 kV/cm were administered. In all the treated lesions, bleeding immediately stopped on administration of the electric pulses and did not recur. The treated metastases developed crusts and the lesions healed in a matter of weeks. Treatments were given under local anaesthesia, lasted a few minutes, and patient discomfort was brief and modest. In conclusion, we propose that electrochemotherapy should be considered for the palliation of haemorrhaging metastases as it is an efficient, tolerable, brief, outpatient, once-only treatment.
12076829	Reevaluation of a North India isolate of hepatitis E virus based on the full-length genomic sequence obtained following long RT-PCR.	The genomic cloning and sequence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) from an epidemic in North India is reported. We describe here a simple method wherein the viral RNA was reverse transcribed and then amplified in a single step using an extra long polymerase chain reaction procedure. The full genome nucleotide sequence of this HEV isolate (called Yam-67) was made up of 7191 nucleotides, excepting the poly(A) tail and had three open reading frames: ORF1 coding for 1693 amino acids (aa), ORF2 coding for 659 aa and ORF3 coding for 122 aa. This North Indian isolate of HEV showed close sequence homology to other HEV isolates from India and Asia, but was distant from the Chinese genotype 4, Japanese, Mexican and US isolates. There is no indication from sequence analysis that this may be an atypical strain of HEV, as reported earlier.
12557212	Recruitment of postmitotic neurons into the regenerating spinal cord of urodeles.	By using fluorescent tracers, we have investigated the origin of the cells that form the regenerating spinal cord after tail amputation in urodele amphibians. We show that spinal cord cells immediately adjacent to the amputation plane die and are removed by phagocytic cells. Spinal cells just anterior to these dying cells are destined to make the majority of the regenerating cord. The largest contribution is likely to come from the radial ependymal cells, but we also demonstrate that postmitotic neurons in this location can translocate into the regenerating cord. These neurons integrate into the regenerate structure and survive for at least 4 weeks. We find no evidence that these translocated neurons dedifferentiate and divide during this regeneration process. We discuss the possibility that these neurons survive long term in the regenerate cord and become part of the functional neuronal circuitry.
9253165	Introducing specific antibodies into electropermeabilized cells is a valuable tool for eliminating specific cell functions.	A technique is established for the role of intracellular proteins to be eliminated and thereby gives information about their specific role in signal transduction within cells. Rat pancreatic islets as well as INS-1 cells (an insulin secreting cell line) were electrically permeabilized in order to introduce high molecular weight compounds. Optimized conditions were five exposures with 15-s intervals, tau = 200 ms, an electric field of 1.36 kV per 0.4 cm in a specific permeabilization buffer at a calculated Ca++ concentration of 5 x 10(-8) M. In electroporation control experiments the spectrophotometrically measured uptake of the cell membrane-impermeable propidium iodide, FITC-labelled dextran (MW approximately 4000) and FITC-labelled antibodies (MW approximately 150,000) was established as being 81.5 +/- 5.0, 82.7 +/- 3.0 and 81.0 +/- 1.0 per cent of maximum, respectively. These data were corroborated qualitatively by visualizing microscopically the fluorescence of the FITC-labelled compounds in islets as well as in INS-1 cells. The cells appear to reseal since control experiments indicated a short-lived outflow of lactate dehydrogenase (MW of 140,000 which is similar to that of antibodies) and of insulin for the first 15-20 min. After electroporation the cells were functionally intact, i.e. responded to the stimulus carbachol (CCh). Only 18.0 +/- 10.1 per cent of cells had not resealed after 2 h (propidium iodide uptake measured at various time intervals after electroporation). As was shown recently the effect of specific compounds such as CCh and CCK8 on insulin release was eliminated selectively by antibodies against specific G proteins thus proving this method to be a valuable tool. In conclusion, adding antibodies to electrically permeabilized cells is a valuable tool for eliminating a specific cell function in order to elucidate the specific role of intracellular compounds. This method can probably be used for testing the specific role of other proteins in cell functions.
9311830	The ability of BHRF1 to inhibit apoptosis is dependent on stimulus and cell type.	The development of resistance to host defense mechanisms such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and Fas-mediated apoptosis of transformed or virus-infected cells may be a critical component in the development of disease. To find genes that protect cells from apoptosis, we used an expression cloning strategy and identified BHRF1, an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) early-lytic-cycle protein with distant homology to Bcl-2, as an anti-apoptosis protein. Expression of BHRF1 in MCF-Fas cells conferred nearly complete resistance against both anti-Fas antibody and TNF-mediated apoptosis. In addition, BHRF1 protected these cells from monocyte-mediated killing but failed to protect them from killing mediated by lymphokine-activated killer cells. The ability of BHRF1 to protect MCF-Fas cells from apoptosis induced by various stimuli was identical to that of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Moreover, the mechanism of action of BHRF1 resembled that of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL as it inhibited TNF- and anti-Fas-induced activation of two enzymes participating in the apoptosis pathway, cytosolic phospholipase A2 and caspase-3/CPP32, but did not interfere with the activation of NF-kappaB-like transcription factors. A putative function of BHRF1 in EBV-infected epithelial cells may be to protect virus-infected cells from TNF- and/or anti-Fas-induced cell death in order to maximize virus production. Surprisingly, expression of neither BHRF1 nor Bcl-2 in a B-cell line, BJAB, protected the cells from anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis even though they increased the survival of serum-starved cells. Thus, the protective role of BHRF1 against apoptosis resembles that of Bcl-2 in being cell type specific and dependent on the apoptotic stimulus.
9726926	Evaluation of the electrostatic field strength at the site of exocytosis in adrenal chromaffin cells.	Exocytosis in secretory cells consists of release from intracellular storage granules directly into the extracellular space via fusion of the granule membrane with the plasma membrane of the cell. It is considered here as comprising two distinct processes. One is the close apposition of granule and plasma membranes. The other arises from interactions between the two membranes during the process of apposition, leading to the formation of a fusion pore. In the following it is shown for the case of the adrenal medullary chromaffin cell that the fusion pore can be ascribed to electroporation of the granule membrane, triggered by the strong electric field existing at the site of exocytosis. Based on an electric surface charge model of the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, resulting from the negatively charged phosphatidylserine groups, it is found that the electrostatic field strength at the site of exocytosis reaches values on the order of 10(8) V/m at small intermembrane distances of 3 nm and lower. The field strength increases with the size of the disc-shaped plasma membrane region generating the electric field, reaching an approximate limit for a radius of 10 nm, at a surface charge density of 5.4 x 10(-2) C/m2. According to previous experimental evaluations of threshold field strength, this field is sufficiently strong to cause membrane electroporation. This step is a precondition for the subsequent membrane fusion during the ongoing process of apposition, leading to secretion.
9973325	Elementary [Ca2+]i signals generated by electroporation functionally mimic those evoked by hormonal stimulation.	The generation of oscillations and global Ca2+ waves relies on the spatio-temporal recruitment of elementary Ca2+ signals, such as 'Ca2+ puffs'. Each elementary signal contributes a small amount of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm, progressively promoting neighboring Ca2+ release sites into an excitable state. Previous studies have indicated that increases in frequency or amplitude of such hormone-evoked elementary Ca2+ signals are necessary to initiate Ca2+ wave propagation. In the present study, an electroporation device was used to rapidly and reversibly permeabilize the plasma membrane of HeLa cells and to allow a limited influx of Ca2+. With low field intensities (100-500 V/cm), brief (50-100 micros) electroporation triggered localized Ca2+ signals that resembled hormone-evoked Ca2+ puffs, but not global signals. With such low intensity electroporative pulses, the Ca2+ influx component was usually undetectable, confirming that the electroporation-induced local signals represented Ca2+ puffs arising from the opening of intracellular Ca2+ release channels. Increasing either the frequency at which low-intensity electroporative pulses were applied, or the intensity of a single electroporative pulse (>500 V/cm), resulted in caffeine-sensitive regenerative Ca2+ waves. We suggest that Ca2+ puffs caused by electroporation functionally mimic hormone-evoked elementary events and can activate global Ca2+ signals if they provide a sufficient trigger.
12481299	Introduction of cell markers into germ layer tissues of the mouse gastrula by whole embryo electroporation.	We have optimized the technique of electroporation for introducing genetic markers into cells of the gastrulating mouse embryo to follow cell fates, tissue movement, and lineage differentiation. Using a plate-needle electrode combination and specific route of plasmid delivery, labeling could be targeted to discrete regions of the epiblast or the endoderm of the late gastrula. Among the various types of fluorescent and chromogenic reporter constructs tested, those driven by CMV promoter are efficient and strong expression can be detected as soon as 2-3 h after electroporation. The efficacy of marking cell lineages by CRE-mediated activation of reporters proved to be inefficient for tracking cell lineages due to an obligatory 8-9-h lag from the electroporation of constructs to the expression of reporter. This significant time lag also raises concern of the temporal precision at which tissue- or stage-specific knock-out or activation of genetic activity may be achieved by the Cre-loxP mechanism.
9397164	Potent inhibition of cell density-dependent apoptosis and enhancement of survival by dimethyl sulfoxide in human myeloblastic HL-60 cells.	Human myeloblastic cell line HL-60 cells undergo apoptosis during in vitro culture in a cell density-dependent manner, and this cell density-dependent apoptosis was observed when the concentration of cultured cells exceeded 8-10 x 10(5) cells/ml. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a differentiation inducer of HL-60 cells, did not amplify, but rather potently inhibited, this apoptosis. In a low density culture condition, DMSO attenuated proliferation of HL-60 cells in spite of its inhibition of apoptosis. In contrast, DMSO did support cell survival under high cell density conditions, and DMSO-treated HL-60 cells reached an extremely high concentration of 2-3 x 10(6) cells/ml, a condition which could never be possible in a usual culture environment. Thus, DMSO exerted dual effects on cell proliferation, i.e., growth inhibition and apoptosis inhibition, and the sum of these effects resulted in an apparently distinct phenomenon according to the culture conditions including cell density.
9560396	High-efficiency transformation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by electroporation.	We have established a high-efficiency method for transforming the unicellular, green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by electroporation. Electroporation of strains CC3395 and CC425, cell wall-less mutants devoid of argininosuccinate lyase (encoded by ARG7), in the presence of the plasmid pJD67 (which contains ARG7) was used to optimize conditions for the introduction of exogenous DNA. The conditions that were varied included osmolarity, temperature, concentration of exogenous DNA, voltage and capacitance. Following optimization, the maximum transformation frequency obtained was 2 x 10(5) transformants per microg of DNA; this frequency is two orders of magnitude higher than obtained with the current standard method using glass beads to introduce exogenous DNA. The electroporation procedure described in this article is of general utility, and makes it feasible to isolate genes by direct complementation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutants.
10678732	Importance of elliptic Fourier methods for morphometry of complex outlines: application to the distal human femur.	The purpose of this technical note is to present an automatic procedure of shape characterisation using new developments in elliptical Fourier methods combined with image analysis techniques. It was applied, as an example, to the outline of the distal extremity of the distal human femur in inferior axial view. This outline was automatically extracted and characterised by an ordered series of harmonics, each harmonic being described by four new parameters called elliptical descriptors. Step by step reconstructions of outlines using an increasing number of harmonics were than performed. The simultaneous study of the elliptic descriptors and of the step by step reconstructions allowed a considerably easier geometric and morphologic interpretation of the harmonic contributions than classically. The main morphologic features of the distal femur (lateral and medial condyles, intercondylar fossa, lateral and medial borders of the articular surface, and patellar groove) were mainly described by the first seven harmonics. These new developments in elliptic Fourier methods open interesting perspectives for the study of complex outlines, providing an accurate individual morphologic characterisation, and thus the possibility of polymorphic analysis.
12553536	Application of in vivo electroporation to cancer gene therapy.	Much intensive research has gone into the development of safe and efficient methods for the delivery of therapeutic genes. In vivo electroporation is a non-viral delivery protocol in which plasmid DNA solutions are injected into targeted tissues, followed by electric pulses (typically 100 V, 50 ms). In general, in vivo electroporation enhances gene expression in targeted tissues by 2-3 orders of magnitude, as compared to the injection of plasmid DNA solutions without electric pulses, and the tissue damage appears to be minimal. Among the other advantages of this technique are that it can safely be administered repeatedly, and it is simpler and more economical to use than viral vectors, especially in clinical cases. Using this approach, highly efficient gene transfer has already been achieved in muscle and liver as well as in tumors. In fact, gene therapies for cancer utilizing in vivo electroporation have been proved effective in a number of experimental murine tumor models. The therapeutic genes delivered in those cases were diverse including, for example, cytokine genes (IL-12) and cytotoxic genes (TRAIL), making possible a wide range of therapeutic strategies. Moreover, systemic antitumor effects were also observed, suggesting that this approach may be effective for the treatment of metastatic as well as primary tumors.
12735313	Data reduction in HLA-D typing with the primed lymphocyte typing (PLT) technique. the normalized median response (NMR).	We describe here a simple non-parametric method for the evaluation of data obtained from primed lymphocyte typing (PLT) experiments. The method is designed to compensate for both differences in the PLT responsiveness and stimulatory capacity by a double normalization procedure based on a representative negative reaction (the median) for each PLT-cell and for each secondary stimulator. The index of response is called the Normalized Median Response (NMR). The NMR-method was developed from data from one of a series of PLT experiments aimed at HLA-D typing. The NMR-method was applied to eight other PLT experiments and was compared to two other calculation methods based on the maximal response of each PLT-cell: (i) a method without compensation for stimulator variation, and (ii) a method including non-parametric compensation for stimulator variation. The eight experiments involved 37 different PLT cells tested against 74 different stimulating cells yielding a total of 1,334 secondary combinations. The NMR-method descriminated significantly better than the other methods when the results were compared to the HLA-D types obtained with homozygous typing cell technique. In particular, the number of extra positive reactions was diminished by the NMR-method. The reproducibility and the sources of variation were studied in the eight experiments and in five additional experiments. The NMR-method reduced the combined priming-to-priming variation and day-to-day variation to a level comparable to the variation between duplicate testings of the same PLT cell tested towards the same set of secondary stimulators in the same secondary PLT experiment.
7615655	Nuclear import of glycoconjugates is distinct from the classical NLS pathway.	The nuclear import of many proteins depends on a short peptide sequence called the nuclear localization signal. However, glycosylated proteins, which lack such a nuclear localization signal, upon their injection into the cytosol by electroporation, enter the nucleus in a sugar-dependent manner. This paper brings new insights on the mechanism of this process, based on a study of neoglycoprotein nuclear uptake by digitonin-permeabilized cells. The nuclear import of neoglycoproteins is energy dependent: it does not occur when cells are maintained at 4 degrees C or when cells are ATP-depleted by treatment with apyrase. The nuclear import of neoglycoproteins occurs through the nuclear pore: it is inhibited by preincubation of cells with wheat germ agglutinin, a lectin which binds the nuclear pore glycoproteins and blocks the translocation step of nuclear localization signal bearing proteins through the nuclear pore. Furthermore, the nuclear import of neoglycoproteins does not use the pathway of nuclear localization signal bearing proteins: nuclear import of nuclear localization signal bearing proteins depends on cytosolic factors and is inhibited by treatment of cells with N-ethylmaleimide, while the nuclear import of neoglycoproteins neither requires added cytosolic factors nor is sensitive to alkylation by N-ethylmaleimide. In addition, upon incubation in the presence of a large excess of nuclear localization signal bearing protein, the nuclear import of neoglycoproteins is not inhibited.
9144393	Foreign gene expression in the mouse testis by localized in vivo gene transfer.	In order to attain foreign gene expression in vivo in the testis of living mice, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), firefly luciferase and bacterial lacZ reporter genes were transfected by microparticle bombardment and electroporation. The results showed that CAT reporter gene was expressed in a dose-dependent fashion. The X-gal staining showed that in some spermatogenic-like cells, the bacterial lacZ gene was also expressed by in vivo electroporation, but not by in vivo microparticle bombardment. The possibility of in vivo gene transfer to the spermatogenic cells of the mouse testis was further confirmed by the fact that the CAT reporter gene expression was testis-specific when driven by the mouse-protamin 1 promoter. It was concluded, therefore, that in vivo microparticle bombardment and, especially, electroporation provide convenient and efficient means of gene transfer to the testis of living mice.
9878617	Identification of viral genes required for cell-to-cell movement of southern bean mosaic virus.	Inoculation of Vigna unguiculata (cowpea) with transcripts synthesized in vitro from a genome-length cDNA clone of the cowpea strain of southern bean mosaic virus (SBMV-C) resulted in a systemic SBMV-C infection of this host. Capped RNA was about five times more infectious than uncapped RNA as determined by a local lesion assay. The SBMV-C cDNA clone was also used for mutagenesis of the four SBMV-C open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1, ORF3, and coat protein (CP) mutants were not infectious in cowpea. Electroporation of cowpea protoplasts with mutant transcripts demonstrated that the ORF1, ORF3, and CP gene products were not required for SBMV-C RNA synthesis, and the ORF1 and ORF3 gene products were not required for SBMV-C assembly. From these results, it was concluded that the ORF1 and ORF3 proteins and the CP are required for SBMV-C cell-to-cell movement. One of the ORF3 mutants pSBMV2-UAA1833 contained a nonsense codon between the predicted -1 ribosomal frameshift site (SBMV-C nucleotides 1796-1802) and a potential ORF3 translation initiation codon at SBMV-C nucleotide 1895. The lack of infectivity of this mutant suggested that ORF3 was expressed by a -1 ribosomal frameshift in ORF2 rather than by initiation of translation at nucleotide 1895.
12011227	Regression of tumor growth and induction of long-term antitumor memory by interleukin 12 electro-gene therapy.	BACKGROUND: Interleukin 12 (IL-12) is a proinflammatory cytokine with antitumor activity. Plasmid-based intratumoral gene therapy for treating malignancy with IL-12 or other genes is safe, inexpensive, and simple to carry out. However, effective delivery methods for injecting DNA plasmid into a tumor to generate therapeutic levels of gene product are lacking. To overcome this obstacle, we used electroporation to deliver the IL-12 gene intratumorally in a murine squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) model, SCCVII. METHODS: Plasmids with or without mouse IL-12 gene were injected into SCCVII tumors of C3H/HeJ mice (n = 5 per group). Electric pulses were then applied to the tumors, a process termed electro-gene therapy. The first treatment was administered when the tumor reached 4-6 mm in diameter, and the second treatment followed a week later. The tumor size, survival, and ability to generate systemic antitumor memory were assessed at various time intervals. Changes in gene expression were measured using northern blot analysis, and vessel density and T-cell infiltration were examined by immunostaining. The results were analyzed by two-sided Student's t tests. RESULTS: Electroporation of 20 microg or 40 microg of IL-12 DNA plasmid eradicated tumors in 40% of mice (P =.031 and.022, respectively). A total of six mice from two separate experiments with regressed tumors were challenged with homologous SCCVII tumor cells multiple times; three of six mice showed no tumor growth for more than 11 months and thus indicated the generation of antitumor memory in these mice. IL-12 electro-gene therapy was associated with increased expression of IL-12, interferon-gamma, monokine induced by interferon-gamma, and interferon-inducible protein 10. IL-12 electro-gene therapy was also associated with decreased vessel density and increased infiltration of CD8(+) T cells after the second administration (P =.02 and.03, respectively). CONCLUSION: IL-12 electro-gene therapy appears to be effective in reducing tumor growth by triggering both antiangiogenic effects and an immune response. The antitumor memory was seen to last more than 11 months. Because IL-12 electro-gene therapy is easy to administer and is effective, it could potentially be applicable in the treatment of electrode-accessible malignancies, such as head and neck SCCs.
12100989	Transdermal insulin delivery using lipid enhanced electroporation.	Transdermal insulin transport by electroporation was measured using porcine epidermis and fluorescein-labeled insulin. Previous studies have shown that anionic lipids can enhance the electroporative transport of molecules up to 10 kDa in size. It was also shown that it is the charge and not the type of the phospholipid head group that influences transdermal transport under electroporation. Moreover, phospholipids with saturated acyl chains enhance the transport of larger molecules more as compared to those with unsaturated chains. In the current study, based on those earlier findings, the effect of 1,2-dimyristoyl-3-phosphatidylserine (DMPS) on the transdermal transport of insulin by electroporation was examined. Porcine epidermis was used as a model for skin. Transport was measured using glass vertical diffusion apparatus in which the epidermis separated the donor and receiver compartments. Negative pulses were applied across the epidermis using platinum electrodes. Results show that when electroporation was carried out in the presence of DMPS, there was greater than 20-fold enhancement of insulin transport. Furthermore, while in the presence of the phospholipid, almost all the transported insulin was detected in the receiver compartment; in the absence of added lipids, only about half the insulin transported was in the receiver compartment and an almost equal amount of insulin remained in the epidermis. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that the insulin transport was mainly through the lipid multilayer regions that surround the corneocytes.
7887937	Long-lived macropinocytosis takes place in electropermeabilized mammalian cells.	Electropermeabilization is a technique which allows free access of molecules to cytosol. In the present study, we report on results dealing with the penetration of macromolecules. Under electric conditions that allow maintenance of cell viability at a high level, i.e., at low electric field intensity but long time duration (ms time range), all the pulsed cells become permeable to macromolecules. By loading beta-galactosidase the electro-transferred activity in the cells is maintained over 24 hours. Transfer mediated during the pulse occurs by free diffusion into the cytoplasm, while post pulse transfer takes place by a different pathway. When added a few minutes after application of the electric field, the enzyme enters the cell via a macropinocytosis-like process. This is a new long-term effect of the electric field pulse on the membrane.
9371459	Unusual structure of the tonB-exb DNA region of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris: tonB, exbB, and exbD1 are essential for ferric iron uptake, but exbD2 is not.	The nucleotide sequence of a 3.6-kb HindIII-SmaI DNA fragment of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris revealed four open reading frames which, based on sequence homologies, were designated tonB, exbB, exbD1, and exbD2. Analysis of translational fusions to alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase confirmed that the TonB, ExbB, ExbD1, and ExbD2 proteins are anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane. The TonB protein of X. campestris pv. campestris lacks the conserved (Glu-Pro)n and (Lys-Pro)m repeats but harbors a 13-fold repeat of proline residues. By mutational analysis, the tonB, exbB, and exbD1 genes were shown to be essential for ferric iron import in X. campestris pv. campestris. In contrast, the exbD2 gene is not involved in the uptake of ferric iron.
10228596	Electric pulse-induced precipitation of biological macromolecules in electroporation.	We found that electric discharge through solution of biological macromolecules (DNA, RNA and proteins) causes precipitation of significant portions of these macromolecules. This precipitation is a consequence of the interaction of biological macromolecules with the metal ions solubilized from the anode plate by the electric pulse, and occurs in both absence and presence of the cells in poration medium. Precipitated fractions of macromolecules sediments at the centrifugation speed used to pellet eukaryotic cells and does not dissolve when washed with buffer. Our data indicate a complication of the direct evaluation of electroporation efficiency based on the assumption that electroporated biological macromolecules which remain associated with the cells after several washes, are successfully electroinjected into the cytoplasm of cells.
10910160	Perspectives for microelectrode arrays for biosensing and membrane electroporation.	Electrochemical microelectrode devices are among the great challenges for bioelectrochemistry, cell biology and recently also for biomedical research and new clinical electrotherapies. Two representative cases in cell biology and medical research for new trends in the technical devices are selected, heading at new diagnostic and therapeutic clinical applications. One example is from the field of biosensing cholinergic neurotransmitter substances by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AcChoR) in solid-supported lipid bilayer membrane and the other one refers to new developments of electrode systems for the electrochemical delivery of drugs and genes to biological cell aggregates and tissue by the powerful method of membrane electroporation. In both cases addressed to, the new developments include the use of electrical feedback control of electrode arrays for biosensing processes as well as for the extent and duration of tissue electroporation. In line with the impressive advances in medical microsurgery, where increasingly smaller organ targets become accessible, microelectrode systems have become a continuous technical challenge for bioanalytical purposes and, as discussed here in some detail, for the new field of the electroporative delivery of effector substances like drugs and genes, using miniaturized electrochemical electrode arrays.
12443697	The role of open learning in nurse education. Does it have a place?	A perceptible shift has begun, away from mass lectures towards more flexible, novel and adaptable methods of teaching and learning. A variety of terms (open, distance, flexible) have been used to describe such instructional methods, a key characteristic of which is that they do not require constant and/or synchronous contact between teacher and learner. This paper explores students' views of a distributed learning initiative within a University in the South of England. The initiatives were in response to increase in the number of students in each intake which was just one of the recent changes called for by the Government. This evaluation consisted of a longitudinal research project following two cohorts of nursing students (n=288) through the first two years of their education (and will continue in the final year). The study assessed the perceived influence of distributed learning (DL) on their academic education and professional training as well as their satisfaction with the workbooks. The evaluation used a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data collection, questionnaires and focus groups. DL was seen as a flexible way of studying for students. Students were able to study a topic area at their own pace and at a time convenient to them. The activities in the workbook stimulated discussions and triggered ideas and thoughts for both students and lecturers. With the commencement of the workbooks lecturers were given the opportunity to reflect on their teaching styles and were encouraged to utilise a number of different teaching and learning methodologies.
9163720	Gene transfer by electroporation.	Electroporation of cells in the presence of DNA is widely used for the introduction of transgenes either stably or transiently into bacterial, fungal, animal, and plant cells. A review of the literature shows that electroporation parameters are often reported in an incomplete or incorrect manner, forcing researchers to rely too much on a purely empirical trial and error approach. The goal of this article is to provide the reader with an understanding of electrical circuits used in electroporation experiments as well as physical and biological aspects of the electroporation process itself. Further, a simple paradigm is provided which unites all electroporation parameters. This article should be particularly useful to those new to the technique.
11249635	Advances in plasmid gene delivery and expression in skeletal muscle.	One of the most striking recent advances for plasmid delivery in vivo has been that of electropermeabilization, commonly referred to as electroporation. This physical process exposes a muscle tissue to a brief, high intensity electric field that induces temporary and reversible breakdown of the plasma membrane. During the period of membrane destabilization, a variety of molecules, including plasmids, gain intracellular access. Electroporation has been shown to improve the efficiency of plasmid gene delivery to skeletal muscle of small animals by as much as two-orders of magnitude to levels comparable to that of adenoviral gene delivery. This technology will allow the muscle to be used as a bioreactor for the secretion of therapeutic proteins into the circulation. This method of gene delivery, which is simple, efficient and reproducible, has become valuable for basic research, with great potential for gene therapy and DNA vaccination. Moreover, significant progress has been made using a variety of molecular designs to achieve regulation of gene expression by low molecular weight drugs. The enhanced efficiency of plasmid delivery by electroporation and the resultant durability of transgene expression, combined with the effectiveness of drug-dependent transgene regulation systems, provide a powerful set of tools that will be broadly applicable to the development of plasmid-based gene therapies for the treatment of human disease.
7620961	Attachment, replication and thrombogenicity of genetically modified endothelial cells.	UNLABELLED: Endothelial cell seeding of prosthetic surfaces has been proposed as a technique to improve the patency of vascular grafts following arterial reconstruction. The introduction of specific recombinant DNA into seeded endothelial cells may enhance the anti-thrombogenic nature of the endothelial-blood interface with a consequent reduction in graft thrombosis. However, the successful use of genetically modified endothelial cells in the seeding process relies on the cells retaining normal function in terms of cellular replication, attachment and secretion of anti-thrombotic mediators. Successful genetic manipulation of human endothelial cells has been accomplished by viral and chemical methods. AIM: To study the functional characteristics of electrontransfected endothelial cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Endothelial cells were electro-transfected with the test plasmid pTCF at a transfection efficiency of 10% utilising a single electric pulse with an electric field of 1000 volts/cm and a time constant of 12.8ms. The functional status of transfected endothelial cells was then compared with a control endothelial cell population. There were no significant differences in replication (p = 0.76), attachment (p = 0.43), basal (p = 0.89) or stimulated (p = 0.11) prostacyclin release between transfected cells as compared with control endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Genetically modified cells are functionally normal, and may be used in endothelial cell seeding of prosthetic vascular surfaces.
9539106	Inhibition of epidermal growth factor-mediated ERK1/2 activation by in situ electroporation of nonpermeant [(alkylamino)methyl]acrylophenone derivatives.	The interruption of signaling cascades in intact cells through the introduction of nonpermeant compounds inferred by in vitro studies to specifically inhibit epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGF-R) function is described. Two nonpermeant [(alkylamino)methyl]acrylophenone derivatives, [(dimethylamino)methyl] acrylo-para-[(benzoylsulfonyl)-oxy]phenone and [(dimethylamino)-methyl]acrylo-para-[(hydroxy-benzoylsulfonyl++ +)-oxy]phenone, were introduced by in situ electroporation into mouse or rat fibroblasts growing on indium-tin oxide-coated glass. Cells were subsequently stimulated with growth factors and assessed for activation of a downstream target, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), by probing with specific antibodies. Electrodes and slides were configured to provide non-electroporated control cells side by side with the electroporated ones, both growing on the same type of indium-tin oxide-coated glass surface. Using this set-up, these compounds could inhibit EGF- but not platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-mediated ERK1/2 activation in vivo. These results demonstrate the potential of the in situ electroporation approach for the study of tyrosine kinase action using selective but nonpermeant inhibitors that would otherwise be ineffective in intact cells.
9804885	Kinetics of ultraweak light emission from human erythroleukemia K562 cells upon electroporation.	Electroporation involves the application of an electric pulse that creates transient aqueous channels (electropores) across the lipid bilayer membranes. Here, we describe an instrument set up suitable to record ultraweak light emission from human erythroleukemia K562 cells during and immediately after delivery of electric pulses. Most of light was emitted in the first seconds after each pulse, following a complex decay which can be fitted by a double exponential equation characterized by two different time constants (T1 and T2), both in the order of seconds. T1 was approximately 10-fold shorter than T2 and both time constants were dependent on field strength of the electric pulse. The effect of various antioxidants on the amount of emitted photons and on T1 and T2 values was investigated, in order to shed some light on the chemical species responsible for cellular luminescence.
11875129	Regulation of cellular differentiation in filamentous cyanobacteria in free-living and plant-associated symbiotic growth states.	Certain filamentous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria generate signals that direct their own multicellular development. They also respond to signals from plants that initiate or modulate differentiation, leading to the establishment of a symbiotic association. An objective of this review is to describe the mechanisms by which free-living cyanobacteria regulate their development and then to consider how plants may exploit cyanobacterial physiology to achieve stable symbioses. Cyanobacteria that are capable of forming plant symbioses can differentiate into motile filaments called hormogonia and into specialized nitrogen-fixing cells called heterocysts. Plant signals exert both positive and negative regulatory control on hormogonium differentiation. Heterocyst differentiation is a highly regulated process, resulting in a regularly spaced pattern of heterocysts in the filament. The evidence is most consistent with the pattern arising in two stages. First, nitrogen limitation triggers a nonrandomly spaced cluster of cells (perhaps at a critical stage of their cell cycle) to initiate differentiation. Interactions between an inhibitory peptide exported by the differentiating cells and an activator protein within them causes one cell within each cluster to fully differentiate, yielding a single mature heterocyst. In symbiosis with plants, heterocyst frequencies are increased 3- to 10-fold because, we propose, either differentiation is initiated at an increased number of sites or resolution of differentiating clusters is incomplete. The physiology of symbiotically associated cyanobacteria raises the prospect that heterocyst differentiation proceeds independently of the nitrogen status of a cell and depends instead on signals produced by the plant partner.
7652510	[Monocyte recruitment in blood vessel wall].	"Adhesion of monocytes to vascular endothelial cell (EC) and subsequent stretching and migration over the luminal surface of EC can be seen in some pathophysiological process in the body. This is called ""monocyte recruitment"". Adhesive molecules and adhesive receptors take part and play an important role in the process. The recruitment can be regulated by many cytokines and chemoattractants. In this article the process, character, mechanism, regulation and effect of monocyte recruitment will be discussed."
8248193	Caveolae: where incoming and outgoing messengers meet.	Plasmalemmal caveolae were first identified as an endocytic compartment in endothelial cells, where they appear to move molecules across the cell by transcytosis. More recently, they have been found to be sites where small molecules are concentrated and internalized by a process called potocytosis. A growing body of biochemical and morphological evidence indicates that a variety of molecules known to function directly or indirectly in signal transduction are enriched in caveolae. This raises the possibility that a third function for caveolae is to process hormonal and mechanical signals for the cell. Insights gained from studying potocytosis suggest several different ways that this membrane specialization might function to integrate incoming and outgoing cellular messages.
8867816	Guanylate cyclase activity in permeabilized Dictyostelium discoideum cells.	Dictyostelium discoideum cells respond to chemoattractants by transient activation of guanylate cyclase. Cyclic GMP is a second messenger that transduces the chemotactic signal. We used an electropermeabilized cell system to investigate the regulation of guanylate cyclase. Enzyme activity in permeabilized cells was dependent on the presence of a nonhydrolysable GTP analogue (e.g., GTP gamma S), which could not be replaced by GTP, GDP, or GMP. After the initiation of the guanylate cyclase reaction in permeabilized cells only a short burst of activity is observed, because the enzyme is inactivated with a t1/2 of about 15 s. We show that inactivation is not due to lack of substrate, resealing of the pores in the cell membrane, product inhibition by cGMP, or intrinsic instability of the enzyme. Physiological concentrations of Ca2+ ions inhibited the enzyme (half-maximal effect at 0.3 microM), whereas InsP3 had no effect. Once inactivated, the enzyme could only be reactivated after homogenization of the permeabilized cells and removal of the soluble cell fraction. This suggests that a soluble factor is involved in an autonomous process that inactivates guanylate cyclase and is triggered only after the enzyme is activated. The initial rate of guanylate cyclase activity in permeabilized cells is similar to that in intact, chemotactically activated cells. Moreover, the rate of inactivation of the enzyme in permeabilized cells and that due to adaptation in vivo are about equal. This suggests that the activation and inactivation of guanylate cyclase observed in this permeabilized cell system is related to that of chemotactic activation and adaptation in intact cells.
11282460	A soluble LAT deletion mutant inhibits T-cell activation: reduced recruitment of signalling molecules to glycolipid-enriched microdomains.	The type III transmembrane adaptor protein linker for activation of T cells (LAT) is essential for membrane recruitment of signalling molecules following TCR activation. Here we show that although LAT deleted in the transmembrane domain is completely soluble, it can be tyrosine phosphorylated after anti-CD3 stimulation or pervanadate treatment. Overexpression of this deletion mutant in transiently transfected Jurkat TAg cells inhibits transcriptional activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT)/AP-1 reporter construct in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, by selection of transiently transfected cells, a clear reduction of TCR-induced CD69 expression was observed in cells expressing the mutant. These dominant negative effects seemed to be dependent both on the ability of the membrane deletion mutant to reduce phosphorylation of endogenous LAT and to reduce interaction of endogenous LAT with PLC-gamma1 and Grb2. Consistent with this, the redistribution of PLC-gamma1 and Grb2 to glycolipid-enriched microdomains, called lipid rafts, after stimulation was inhibited when the soluble form of LAT was overexpressed. We suggest that the dominant negative effect is caused by the ability of the mutant to sequester signalling molecules in cytosol and thereby inhibit redistribution of signalling molecules to lipid rafts upon T-cell activation.
14521908	Calcium bursts induced by nanosecond electric pulses.	We report here real-time imaging of calcium bursts in human lymphocytes exposed to nanosecond, megavolt-per-meter pulsed electric fields. Ultra-short (less than 30 ns), high-field (greater than 1 MV/m), electric pulses induce increases in cytosolic calcium concentration and translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS) to the outer layer of the plasma membrane in Jurkat T lymphoblasts. Pulse-induced calcium bursts occur within milliseconds and PS externalization within minutes. Caspase activation and other indicators of apoptosis follow these initial symptoms of nanosecond pulse exposure. Pulse-induced PS translocation is observed even in the presence of caspase inhibitors. Ultra-short, high-field, electroperturbative pulse effects differ substantially from those associated with electroporation, where pulses of a few tens of kilovolts-per-meter lasting a few tens of microseconds open pores in the cytoplasmic membrane. Nanosecond pulsed electric fields, because their duration is less than the plasma membrane charging time, develop voltages across intracellular structures without porating the cell.
8764686	Application of an optimized electroporation procedure for replacement of the polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase I gene in Nocardia corallina.	To develop a system for gene replacement in Nocardia corallina, a protocol for electroporation was optimized by systematic alterations of growth conditions, field strength, time constant and the electroporation buffer. Transformation efficiencies of 0.5 x 10(6) - 3 x 10(6) transformants/microgram plasmid DNA were obtained routinely. The gene encoding the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase I of N. corallina was cloned and interrupted by insertion of a kanamycin-resistance gene. The resulting plasmid was introduced into N. corallina by electroporation to inactivate the wild-type gene by homologous recombination. Kanamycin-resistant clones were screened by Southern hybridization for the absence of the wild-type gene and analyzed for PHA accumulation.
9518614	Chronopotentiometric studies of electroporation of bilayer lipid membranes.	The constant-intensity current chronopotentiometric measurements of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine bilayer membranes (BLM) are presented. It is demonstrated that a constant-intensity current flowing through the bilayer membranes generates the pores in their structures. For the current intensity from 0.1 to 2.0 nA, the generated pores open and close cyclically. The frequency of oscillations depends on the current intensity: the higher current intensity, the higher frequency of pore oscillations. It is suggested that the presented method may allow to create one pore in BLM and to observe its dynamical behaviour. Based on chronopotentiometric curves, a method of pore conductance calculations is presented. It is demonstrated that the value of obtained conductance can be applied for pore diameter estimation. The hypothetical application of constant-current method as a biotechnological tool for selective and controlled incorporation of molecules into microorganisms is discussed.
9795248	In vitro study of alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase encapsulated into human erythrocytes by an electroporation procedure.	The optimal conditions for electroporated/resealed loading of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and/or acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) into human erythrocytes were established prior to the study, with the following characteristics: 300 V, 1 ms pulse time, eight pulses every 15 min and 1 h resealing at 37 degreesC. High encapsulation yield and carrier cell recoveries were achieved. Cell volumes increase while hemoglobin contents decrease; in consequence a decrease in cell hemoglobin concentration was observed. A lower hypotonic resistance of loading erythrocytes (throughout osmotic fragility curves) and unaltered oxygen transport capability (as given by oxygen equilibrium curves) were observed. The stability against time (up to 168 h-7 days) of encapsulated individual enzymes, either ADH- or ALDH-red blood cells (RBCs), was studied at 4 degreesC and 37 degreesC, in comparison with that of free enzyme solutions. Both enzymes were released from carrier RBCs to the incubation medium. The stability of carrier RBCs was studied under similar conditions. Non-significant variations in hematological parameters were observed. However, the hemoglobin derivative forms showed modifications. The continuous degradation of ethanol by ADH-RBCs and coencapsulated ADH- and ALDH-RBCs, as a function of time (up to 70 h) suggests the use of these carrier RBCs as agents for complete metabolization of ethanol. The mentioned properties bare the possibility of using ADH and ALDH as carrier systems in in vivo situations.
11257031	DNA transformation of Leishmania infantum axenic amastigotes and their use in drug screening.	Protocols for DNA electroporation in Leishmania promastigote cells are well established. More recently, in vitro culture of axenic Leishmania amastigotes became possible. We have established conditions for DNA transformation of axenically grown Leishmania infantum amastigotes. Parameters for DNA electroporation of Leishmania axenic amastigotes were systematically studied using luciferase-mediated transient transfection. Cell lines expressing stable luciferase activity were then selected, and their ability to be used in an in vitro drug screening procedure was determined. A model was established, using axenic amastigotes expressing luciferase activity, for rapidly determining the activity of drugs directly against both axenic and intracellular amastigotes. For intracellular amastigotes, the 50% effective concentrations of pentamidine, sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam), meglumine (Glucantime), and potassium antimonyl tartrate determined with the luciferase assay were 0.2 microM (0.12 microg/ml), 55 microg/ml, 95 microg/ml, and 0.12 microg/ml, respectively; these values are in agreement with values determined by more labor-intensive staining methods. We also showed the usefulness of luciferase-expressing parasites for analyzing drug resistance. The availability of luciferase-expressing amastigotes for use in high-throughput screening should facilitate the search for new antileishmanial drugs.
7806071	Oxidative damage of the membrane lipids after electroporation.	Electric field pulses used for cell manipulation can cause irreversible cell damage. The mechanisms of the processes leading to such cell damage are very complicated. Our work demonstrated that exponential electric pulses with intensity of 2-7.5 kV/cm and duration of 5.2 ms were able to initiate peroxidation of fatty acid emulsions, liposomal membranes, red blood and Ehrlich ascite tumor cells. Electric pulses-induced peroxidation of erythrocyte membranes was followed by hemolysis. The electric treatment caused damage of E. coli membrane lipids which was accompanied by decreased cell survival. All these effects depended on field intensity. A relatively good correlation between pulse-induced peroxidation of erythrocyte membranes and hemolysis was observed. These results suggest that free radical mediated processes as lipid peroxidation and/or lipid degradation or fragmentation may be possible causes for electric pulses-induced irreversible cell damage.
10704667	Introduction of macromolecules into synaptosomes using electroporation.	Synaptic terminals are sites of high metabolic activity and thus are particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress. Oxidative damage to proteins can be toxic to neurons and may cause irreversible cell damage and neurodegeneration. A neuroprotective mechanism used by cells to combat oxidative damage is to selectively degrade damaged proteins. Therefore, it is of interest to study the mechanism of degradation of oxidatively damaged proteins in synaptosomes. One way of oxidizing synaptosomal proteins in vitro is by incubating intact synaptosomes in the presence of an oxidizing agent. A problem with this approach is that it may also cause oxidative damage to the machinery required to recognize and degrade oxidized proteins. We have, therefore, introduced a fluorescent macromolecule into synaptosomes to assess the feasibility of using this technique to study how oxidized proteins are degraded and removed from synaptic terminals. Synaptosomes were subjected to electroporation in the presence of FITC labelled-dextran with an average molecular weight of 70000 (FD-70) and non-specific binding was determined by running parallel experiments in lysed synaptosomes. Following extensive washing, synaptosomes were assayed for the presence of intra-synaptosomal FD-70 by measuring fluorescence in a microplate fluorescence reader. Significant differences in fluorescence were found between intact and lysed synaptosomes with maximal uptake at 100 V/ 1500 microF (approx. 36 pmol/mg protein). To determine if membrane transport was compromised by electroporation, uptake of 3H-arginine was compared in control and electroporated synaptosomes. While untreated electroporated synaptosomes showed a loss of 22% in the ability to transport arginine, preincubation in the presence of 1 mM ATP resulted in a complete restoration of arginine transport. These results show that electroporation is a potentially useful technique for introducing a specific oxidized protein, into synaptic terminals so its metabolic fate can be examined.
10726782	Spotting of disc haemorrhages on fundus pictures; on Kodachrome slides and on digitally enhanced images.	PURPOSE: To find out whether digital processing can facilitate interpretation of fundus photographs. METHODS: Digitised fundus pictures were manipulated and enhanced by a process called histogram equalisation. Essentially, the gamma values for red (R), green (G), and blue (B) were separately modified. The principle is explained and exemplified. MATERIAL AND RESULTS: Small disc haemorrhages, which may normally be hard to detect, became more visible after histogram equalisation, which is demonstrated in test series. CONCLUSION: Digital histogram equalisation offers a new way of looking at fundus pictures, which, alone or combined with other capabilities of digital processing, has great potential for diagnosis, as well as for follow up studies. The possibility to decide the true nature of suspect spots after applying the enhancement procedure is likewise of great value.
10915934	Enhanced transdermal delivery of tetracaine by electroporation.	The effect of electroporation on the transport of tetracaine through skin in vitro was studied using side-by-side compartment diffusion cells method. After achieving steady state by passive diffusion, fluxes of tetracaine achieved with passive diffusion, electroporative pulse and iontophoresis were compared. Electroporation (square-wave pulse, voltage 130 V, pulse time 0.4 s, pulse frequency 40 pulses min(-1)) or iontophoresis (0.2.mA cm(-2), lasting for 4 h) increased the transport of tetracaine through skin. The flux of tetracaine at 0.25 h after electroporation (pulse number 400) was 54.6+/-6.0 microg.cm(-2).h(-1), that after iontophoresis was 17.4+/-5.8 microg.cm(-2).h(-1) and that after passive diffusion was 8.2+/-0.5 microg.cm(-2).h(-1). In addition, the fluxes of tetracaine increased with the increasing of pulse number. From these results, it is clear that electroporation is effective in enhancing transdermal delivery of tetracaine and its function is better than iontophoresis.
11086923	Effects of application voltage and cathode and anode positions at electroporation on the in vitro permeation of benzoic acid through hairless rat skin.	The enhancing effect of electroporation on the in vitro skin permeation of benzoate was evaluated. Needle and ring electrodes made of Ag/AgCl were connected to an electrical power source, which produced exponentially decaying pulses. The needle electrode was kept in contact with the skin surface, and the ring electrode was positioned either on or under the skin. The electrical pulse was applied to abdominal hairless rat skin at 150-600 V every minute from 4 to 6 h during the 10-h permeation experiment. Skin permeation of benzoate was promoted by electroporation and the effect was increased by application of a higher voltage. No immediate recovery to the control flux, however, was observed for high voltage groups after turning off the voltage application. When the cathode and anode were separated by the skin membrane by setting in the epidermal and dermal sides, respectively, an iontophoretic effect may also play a role in benzoate flux. These results indicated that the drug permeation by electroporation is the result of passive diffusion and an iontophoretic effect as well as the electroporation effect.
9574721	Simplification of a locus-specific DNA typing method (Vir typing) for Streptococcus pyogenes.	We describe a simplification of a highly discriminatory molecular typing method, called Vir typing, for Streptococcus pyogenes (D. Gardiner, J. Hartas, B. Currie, J. D. Mathews, D. J. Kemp, and K. S. Sriprakash, PCR Methods Appl. 4:288-293, 1995). The procedure can be completed within a day, is reproducible, and can be applied directly to colonies growing on primary culture plates, allowing rapid establishment of strain identity in an outbreak.
10910161	Theoretical modeling of the effects of shock duration, frequency, and strength on the degree of electroporation.	Electroporation is becoming an increasingly important tool for introducing biologically active compounds into living cells, yet the effectiveness of this technique can be low, particularly in vivo. One way to improve the success rate is to optimize the shock protocols, but experimental studies are costly, time consuming, and yield only an indirect measurement of pore creation. Alternatively, this study models electroporation in two geometries, a space-clamped membrane and a single cell, and investigates the effects of pulse duration, frequency, shape, and strength. The creation of pores is described by a first order differential equation derived from the Smoluchowski equation. Both the membrane and the cell are exposed to monophasic and biphasic shocks of varying duration (membrane, 10 micros-100 s; cell, 0.1 micros-200 ms) and to trains of monophasic and biphasic pulses of varying frequency (membrane, 50 Hz-4 kHz; cell, 200 kHz-6 MHz). The effectiveness of each shock is measured by the fractional pore area (FPA). The results indicate that FPA is sensitive to shock duration only in a very narrow range (membrane, approximately 1 ms; cell, approximately 0.25 micros). In contrast, FPA is sensitive to shock strength and frequency of the pulse train, increasing linearly with shock strength and decreasing slowly with frequency. In all cases, monophasic shocks were at least as effective as biphasic shocks, implying that varying the strength and frequency of a monophasic pulse train is the most effective way to control the creation of pores.
10946990	A temporal mechanism for generating the phase precession of hippocampal place cells.	The phase relationship between the activity of hippocampal place cells and the hippocampal theta rhythm systematically processes as the animal runs through the region in an environment called the place field of the cell. We present a minimal biophysical model of the phase precession of place cells in region CA3 of the hippocampus. The model describes the dynamics of two coupled point neurons--namely, a pyramidal cell and an interneuron, the latter of which is driven by a pacemaker input. Outside of the place field, the network displays a stable, background firing pattern that is locked to the theta rhythm. The pacemaker input drives the interneuron, which in turn activates the pyramidal cell. A single stimulus to the pyramidal cell from the dentate gyrus, simulating entrance into the place field, reorganizes the functional roles of the cells in the network for a number of cycles of the theta rhythm. In the reorganized network, the pyramidal cell drives the interneuron at a higher frequency than the theta frequency, thus causing a systematic precession relative to the theta input. The frequency of the pyramidal cell can vary to account for changes in the animal's running speed. The transient dynamics end after up to 360 degrees of phase precession when the pacemaker input to the interneuron occurs at a phase to return the network to the stable background firing pattern, thus signaling the end of the place field. Our model, in contrast to others, reports that phase precession is a temporally, and not spatially, controlled process. We also predict that like pyramidal cells, interneurons phase precess. Our model provides a mechanism for shutting off place cell firing after the animal has crossed the place field, and it explains the observed nearly 360 degrees of phase precession. We also describe how this model is consistent with a proposed autoassociative memory role of the CA3 region.
11718193	The use of a retractor system (SynFrame) for open, minimal invasive reconstruction of the anterior column of the thoracic and lumbar spine.	"In 65 consecutive cases of trauma (n=55), pseudo-arthrosis (n=4) and metastasis (n=6), anterior reconstruction of the thoracic and lumbar spine was performed using a new minimal invasive but open access procedure. No operation had to be changed into an open procedure. The thoracolumbar junction was approached by a left-sided mini-thoracotomy (n=50), the thoracic spine by a right-sided mini-thoracotomy (n=8) and the lumbar spine by a left sided mini-retroperitoneal approach (n=7), using a new table-mounted retractor system called SynFrame (Stratec Medical, Switzerland). The anterior column was reconstructed using a variety of materials: autologous tricortical crest (n=11), autologous spongiosa (n=12), allografts (n=4) and cages (n=38). The mean overall operating time was 170 min (range 90-295 min); the time of surgery varied, depending on the spine pathology and the magnitude of the intervention in the anterior part of the spine. Mean overall blood loss was 912 ml, and only 7 out of the 65 patients needed blood transfusions. There were neither intra- nor postoperative complications related to the minimal access in particular, nor visceral/vascular complications. No intercostal neuralgia, no post-thoracotomy pain syndromes, no superficial or deep wound infections and no deep venous thromboses occurred. Four cases of pseudo-obstruction were treated conservatively. In this study, we describe the new minimal access technology to the anterior part of the thoracal and lumbar spine on the basis of 65 cases completed within 1 year. This open, but minimal invasive, access technology offers, in our view, additional advantages to the ""pure"" endoscopic procedures of spinal surgery."
12941161	In situ electroporation of radioactive compounds into adherent cells.	We previously developed a technique, termed in situ electroporation, where nonpermeant molecules are introduced through an electrical pulse into adherent cells, while they grow on electrically conductive, optically transparent, indium-tin oxide (ITO). Careful control of the electric field intensity results in essentially 100% of the cells taking up the introduced material, without any detectable effect upon the physiology of the cell, presumably because the pores reseal rapidly so that the cellular interior is restored to its original state. Electroporation of radioactive material is faced with two important considerations: (1) potential for exposure of personnel to irradiation, and (2) the requirement for electroporation of a large number of cells. In this report, we describe a modification in the geometry of the slides and electrodes which permits the use of inexpensive ITO-coated glass of lower conductivity that can be discarded after use, to electroporate large numbers of cells using a minimum volume of radioactive nucleotide solution. The results demonstrate that, using this assembly, the determination of the Ras-bound GTP/GTP+GDP ratios through electroporation of [alpha32P]GTP can be conducted using approximately five times lower amounts of isotope than in previous designs. Moreover, this assembly permits efficient upscaling, which makes the determination of Ras-GTP binding in cells which are deficient in Ras activity possible. In addition, we demonstrate the labeling of two viral phosphoproteins--the Simian Virus 40 Large Tumor antigen, and Adenovirus E1A--through [gamma32P]ATP electroporation using this setup. In both cases, electroporation of the nucleotide can achieve a great increase in the efficiency and specificity of labeling compared to the addition of [32P]-orthophosphate to the culture medium, presumably because the immediate phosphate donor nucleotide itself is introduced, which can directly bind to the target proteins.
7616612	CNS myelinogenesis in vitro: time course and pattern of rat oligodendrocyte development.	"Oligodendrocyte precursor cells that develop into myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system (CNS) were cultured from newborn rat brain to study how they proliferate and differentiate in normal conditioning medium, and their cell development was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation and immunocytochemical studies. We have identified A2B5-negative pre-O2A progenitor cells (so-called ""type-1"" oligodendrocytes) in the secondary cultures on the astrocyte feeder layer. These cells are very small (diameter: 3.5 microns), round, and glossy, and develop into the process-bearing O2A progenitor cells (called ""type-2"" oligodendrocytes), which also express myelin basic protein (MBP) both in the cell body and in their cell processes. Finally, they develop into mature oligodendrocytes (called ""type-3"" oligodendrocytes). After MBP expression is elicited in these cells and MBP accumulates in the cell process in the area in contact with the axon, these cells are capable of forming the myelin sheath. Therefore, we examined the mechanism of myelin-sheath formation of ""type-3"" oligodendrocytes using video time-lapse movies, and demonstrated that these cells initially sent out processes to search for axons several times before the onset of myelination. Then thick filopodia extended towards the axon, and at the same time, the axonal part of neuron moved forward. Finally the ruffling lamellipodial parts wrapped up the axon similarly to a transverse wave with the secured thick filopodial process on the axon acting as scaffolding. These results suggest that our experimental systems are useful in studying normal oligodendrocyte development and their cellular biochemistry, as well as investigating the mechanism of myelin formation by oligodendrocytes."
9924627	Calmodulin regulation of Ca2+ entry in Jurkat T cells.	We have previously proposed a role for calmodulin (CaM) in the regulation of initiation of Ca2+ entry in Jurkat T cells, as well as in the regulation of the current that mediates Ca2+ entry, IT. In this report, we provide evidence for the mechanism of CaM action. We have previously shown that activation-induced Ca2+ entry into Jurkat T cells is mediated by a current we have called IT. In the whole cell variation, but not the perforated patch variation, of the patch clamp technique, this current is short-lived (under 6 min) suggesting that the current is under the control of a diffusible component of the cytosol. Addition of CaM to the whole cell recording pipette solution maintained IT for up to 20 min, suggesting that CaM may be this diffusible component. Pharmacological inhibitors of CaM blocked the augmentation of IT normally induced by an activating stimulus. Cells electroporated in the presence of anti-CaM antibodies had reduced influx of extracellular Ca2+, with no change in release of Ca2+ from the internal stores. These observations suggest that T cell receptor engagement initiates Ca2+ influx by a pathway that likely includes CaM, which may in turn regulate IT. Influx of extracellular Ca2+ is required for cellular proliferation, and inhibition of CaM by pharmacological inhibitors reduced cellular proliferation. This same inhibition of proliferation was seen in cells electroporated with anti-CaM antibodies. This suggests that inhibition of CaM and/or IT may be a target for therapeutic inhibition of inappropriate T cell proliferation.
11668583	Recovery of flagellar dynein function in a Chlamydomonas actin/dynein-deficient mutant upon introduction of muscle actin by electroporation.	Flagellar and ciliary inner-arm dyneins contain actin as a subunit; however, the function of this actin subunit remains unknown. As a first step toward experimental manipulation of actin in dynein, we developed a method for introducing exogenous actin into Chlamydomonas cells by electroporation. A non-motile mutant, ida5oda1, lacking inner-arm dyneins due to the absence of conventional actin, was electroporated in the presence of rabbit skeletal muscle actin. About 20% of the electroporated cells recovered motility under optimal conditions. In addition, by taking advantage of their phototactic behavior, the rescued cells could be concentrated. Motility was also recovered with fluorescently labeled actin; in this case, axonemes became fluorescent after electroporation, suggesting that actin was in fact incorporated as a dynein subunit. The feasibility of incorporating a substantial amount of macromolecules by electroporation will be useful not only for studying actin function, but also for a variety of studies using Chlamydomonas in which no efficient methods have been developed for expressing or introducing foreign proteins and other macromolecules.
12223952	[Case report of a severe corneoscleral burn caused by the phacoemulsification probe].	"We report a case in which a severe corneoscleral burn occurred during the first seconds of a phacoemulsification procedure. The procedure, a superior temporal corneal limbus incision on the right eye, was carried out on a 79-year-old woman presenting a cataract with an average lens density, who had no other risk factors for complications. In spite of a mild nucleus density and routine phacoemulsification equipment (PULSAR - OPTIKON 2000) with resterilizable parts, a severe corneal injury occurred with tissue shrinkage around the surgical wound. It led to an immediate severe astigmatism which only partially decreased in the following 7 months. We discuss the mechanism which may bring about this type of injury and the likely cause in this case. We also describe the primary sign (""lens milk"") indicating that the procedure should immediately be stopped, and finally we suggest methods to reduce the incidence of such so-called ""phacoburns""."
7552687	Rapid optimization of electroporation conditions for plant cells, protoplasts, and pollen.	The optimization of electroporation conditions for maximal uptake of DNA during direct gene transfer experiments is critical to achieve high levels of gene expression in transformed plant cells. Two stains, trypan blue and fluorescein diacetate, have been applied to optimize electroporation conditions for three plant cell types, using different square wave and exponential wave electroporation devices. The different cell types included protoplasts from tobacco, a stable mixotrophic suspension cell culture from soybean with intact cell walls, and germinating pollen from alfalfa and tobacco. Successful electroporation of each of these cell types was obtained, even in the presence of an intact cell wall when conditions were optimized for the electroporation pulse. The optimal field strength for each of these cells differs, protoplasts having the lowest optimal pulse field strength, followed by suspension cells and finally germinating pollen requiring the strongest electroporation pulse. A rapid procedure is described for optimizing electroporation parameters using different types of cells from different plant sources.
7702835	Electroporation of peptides into adherent cells in situ.	To study the effect of protein interactions in vivo upon cellular functions,such complexes may be disrupted through the introduction of peptides corresponding to the proteins' points of contact. In this communication a simple, rapid and reproducible procedure for peptide introduction into adherent cells by electroporation is described. Cells are grown on electrically conductive, optically transparent indium-tin oxide at the time of pulse delivery. Several electrode and slide configurations, necessary to obtain non-electroporated cells adjacent to the electroporated ones as a control, are outlined. Careful control of electric field strength achieved the introduction of the peptide into essentially 100% of the cells while this treatment caused no detectable disruption of their division cycle.
8020717	[The introduction of the marker gene Neor into hematopoietic stem cells by electroporation].	An electroporation method has been used to introduce marker gene Neor into mouse stem hemopoietic cells which are capable of long-term hemopoiesis maintenance in marrow long-term cultures. Integration of the gene was tested by polymerase chain reaction. The effect of the procedure averaged 50-80% of marked CFUc. Electroporation did little damage to hemopoietic cell precursors. Gene transfer can be made most effectively using bone marrow from mice injected 5-fluorouracil 4 days prior to the experiment.
8061322	Non-recombinant background in gene targeting: illegitimate recombination between a hpt gene and a defective 5' deleted nptII gene can restore a Kmr phenotype in tobacco.	Previously we have demonstrated gene targeting in plants after Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. In these initial experiments a transgenic tobacco line 104 containing a T-DNA insertion with a defective neomycin phosphotransferase (nptII) gene was transformed with a repair construct containing an otherwise defective nptII gene. Homologous recombination between the chromosomally located target and the incoming complementary defective nptII construct generated an intact nptII gene and led to a kanamycin-resistant (Kmr) phenotype. The gene targeting frequency was 1 x 10(-5). In order to compare direct gene transfer and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation with respect to gene targeting we transformed the same transgenic tobacco line 104 via electroporation. A total of 1.35 x 10(8) protoplasts were transformed with the repair construct. Out of nearly 221,000 transformed cells 477 Kmr calli were selected. Screening the Kmr calli via PCR for recombination events revealed that in none of these calli gene targeting had occurred. To establish the origin of the high number of Kmr calli in which gene targeting had not occurred we analysed plants regenerated from 24 Kmr calli via PCR and sequence analysis. This revealed that in 21 out of 24 plants analysed the 5'-deleted nptII gene was fused to the hygromycin phosphotransferase (hpt) gene that was also present on the repair construct. Sequence analysis of 7 hpt/nptII gene fusions showed that they all contained a continuous open reading frame. The absence of significant homology at the fusion site indicated that fusion occurred via a process of illegitimate recombination. Therefore, illegitimate recombination between an introduced defective gene and another gene present on the repair construct or the chromosome has to be taken into account as a standard byproduct in gene targeting experiments.
8647111	Molecular cloning of endothelial, inducible nitric oxide synthase gene from rat aortic endothelial cell.	We have isolated and sequenced clones of an inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) from cDNA library of interleukin-1 beta-treated rat aortic endothelial cells (EC) completely free from other cell types. The cloned cDNA contains an ORF consisting of 3441 bp, which encodes 1147 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence contains putative binding sites for NADPH, FMN, FAD, calmodulin and heme. By comparison with amino acid sequences of other isoforms, rat EC iNOS is very similar (92% similarity) to mouse macrophage iNOS. There are four AUUUA motifs, potentially responsible for the instability of the mRNA, in 3'non-coding region of rat EC iNOS cDNA. Transient transfection of cultured rat vascular smooth-muscle cells with a full-length rat EC iNOS cDNA/SR alpha 296 construct by electroporation resulted in massive NO production in proportion to the doses of cDNA used. Northern blot analysis using rat EC iNOS cDNA as a probe revealed that cycloheximide treatment led to a marked accumulation of iNOS mRNA in the presence and absence of interleukin-1 beta. No appreciable decay in the cycloheximide-induced iNOS mRNA accumulation was observed, suggesting that blockade of de novo protein synthesis stabilizes mRNA. These results demonstrate that rat EC iNOS is identical (or very similar) to macrophage iNOS, and suggest that the EC iNOS gene is also regulated at the post-transcriptional level.
9779991	Cell cycle targets of Ras/Raf signalling.	The regulation of cell proliferation in multicellular organisms is a complex process, which is primarily regulated by external growth factors provided by surrounding cells. Once induced to proliferate, the passage through the mitotic cell cycle is directed by the components of the so called cell cycle machinery. Over the last years research on growth factor signal-transduction and the components of the cell cycle system has lead to a detailed knowledge of the mechanisms by which growth factors transmit their signals and of the relationship between the components of the cell cycle machinery. The remaining question how the growth factor mediated signal-transduction cascades couple with the cell cycle regulators has recently been a focus of interest.
10465737	Modeling electroporation in a single cell. II. Effects Of ionic concentrations.	This study expands a previously developed model of a single cell electroporated by an external electric field by explicitly accounting for the ionic composition of the electroporation current. The previous model with non-specific electroporation current predicts that both the transmembrane potential V(m) and the pore density N are symmetric about the equator, with the same values at either end of the cell. The new, ion-specific case predicts that V(m) is symmetric and almost identical to the profile from the non-specific case, but N has a profound asymmetry with the pore density at the hyperpolarized end of the cell twice the value at the depolarized end. These modeling results agree with the experimentally observed preferential uptake of marker molecules at the hyperpolarized end of the cell as reported in the literature. This study also investigates the changes in intracellular ionic concentrations induced around an electroporated single cell. For all ion species, the concentrations near the membrane vary significantly, which may explain the electrical disturbances observed experimentally after large electric shocks are delivered to excitable cells and tissues.
7504954	Analysis of nucleosome assembly and histone exchange using antibodies specific for acetylated H4.	Using antibodies that specifically recognize the acetylated forms of histone H4, we show that it is possible to immunoprecipitate newly assembled (acetylated) nucleosomes. Newly replicated HeLa cell chromatin was labeled for 5-30 min with [3H]thymidine in the presence of sodium butyrate (thus inhibiting the deacetylation of newly deposited H4); bulk chromatin DNA was labeled for 24 h with [14C]thymidine. When soluble nucleosomes were incubated with immobilized antibodies, a comparison of the bound and unbound fractions showed up to a 65-fold enrichment for new chromatin DNA in the immunoprecipitate (bound), relative to the supernatant (unbound). No enrichment for new DNA was observed when preimmune control serum was used in a similar fashion. The enrichment for new DNA in the immunopellet was paralleled by a similar enrichment for all four newly synthesized histones. Acetylation was required for antibody recognition: When chromatin was replicated in the absence of butyrate (permitting histone deacetylation and chromatin maturation), equally low levels of new and old chromatin were immunoprecipitated, and no enrichment for new DNA was observed. Competition experiments confirmed these results. Analyses of histone deposition during the inhibition of DNA replication established that acetylated chromatin is the preferential target for H2A/H2B exchange. These experiments provide evidence for the highly selective assembly of newly synthesized H3, H2A, and H2B with acetylated H4, and for the involvement of histone acetylation in dynamic chromatin remodeling. In addition, immunoprecipitations of radiolabeled cytosolic extracts identified a possible somatic chromatin preassembly complex, containing newly synthesized H3 and new (acetylated) H4.
8257695	Parental nucleosomes segregated to newly replicated chromatin are underacetylated relative to those assembled de novo.	"Antibodies specific for acetylated histone H4 were used to examine the acetylation state of parental histones that segregate to newly replicated DNA. To generate newly replicated chromatin containing only segregated parental nucleosomes, isolated nuclei were labeled with [3H]TTP in vitro; alternatively, whole cells were labeled with [3H]thymidine in the presence of cycloheximide. Soluble chromatin was prepared by micrococcal nuclease digestion, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with ""penta"" antibodies (Lin et al., 1989). In sharp contrast to nucleosomes containing newly synthesized, diacetylated H4 (Perry et al., 1993), chromatin replicated in vitro was only marginally susceptible to immunoprecipitation. Control experiments established that bona fide acetylated chromatin was selectively immunoprecipitated by the same techniques and that segregated nucleosomes were not disassembled during treatment with ""penta"" antibodies. When replication was coupled to an in vitro histone acetylation system, the enrichment for segregated nucleosomes in the immunopellet increased approximately 3-fold, demonstrating that changes in the acetylation state of segregated histones can be detected immunologically and that parental histones on new DNA are accessible to acetyltransferases during, or immediately after, DNA replication. In vivo pulse-chase experiments, performed in the presence of cycloheximide, confirmed these results. Uptake experiments further established that concurrent histone acetylation did not alter the rate of DNA synthesis in vitro. Our results provide evidence that replication-competent chromatin is not obligatorily acetylated, and indicate that the acetylation status of segregated histones may be maintained during chromatin replication. The possible significance of this, with respect to the regulation of chromatin higher order structures during DNA replication, and the propagation of transcriptionally active vs inactive chromatin structures, is discussed."
8886973	Chromatin organization in the homogeneously staining regions of a methotrexate-resistant mouse cell line: interspersion of inactive and active chromatin domains distinguished by acetylation of histone H4.	We have analyzed the organization of the homogeneously staining regions (HSRs) in chromosomes from a methotrexate-resistant mouse melanoma cell line. Fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques were used to localize satellite DNA sequences and the amplified copies of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene that confer drug-resistance, in combination with immunofluorescence using antibody probes to differentiate chromatin structure. We show that the major DNA species contained in the HSRs is mouse major satellite, confirming previous reports, and that this is interspersed with DHFR DNA in an alternating tandem array that can be resolved at the cytological level. Mouse minor satellite DNA, which is normally located at centromeres, is also distributed along the HSRs, but does not appear to interfere with centromere function. The blocks of major satellite DNA are coincident with chromatin domains that are labelled by an autoantibody that recognizes a mammalian homologue of Drosophila heterochromatin-associated protein 1, shown previously to be confined to centric heterochromatin in mouse. An antiserum that specifically recognizes acetylated histone H4, a marker for active chromatin, fails to bind to the satellite DNA domains, but labels the intervening segments containing DHFR DNA. We can find no evidence for the spreading of the inactive chromatin domains into adjacent active chromatin, even after extended passaging of cells in the absence of methotrexate selection.
9395244	Phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein stimulates DNA polymerase alpha.	Human retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, immunopurified from an extract of recombinant baculovirus infected cells, stimulated 10-100-fold the activity of DNA polymerase alpha from calf thymus or human HeLa cells. Purified Rb protein is composed of two electrophoretically distinguishable forms, i.e., partially phosphorylated and under-phosphorylated forms. Dephosphorylation of Rb protein by protein phosphatase 2A largely diminished its stimulatory effect. On the other hand, a hyperphosphorylated Rb protein, obtained from insect cells overexpressing Rb protein, cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 simultaneously, stimulated DNA polymerase alpha more strongly than the singly-expressed Rb protein. These results indicate that the phosphorylation is crucial for the stimulation. Rb protein isolated from human Burkitt lymphoma Raji cells also stimulated DNA polymerase alpha. In contrast, Rb protein did not affect eukaryotic DNA primase or Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. By immunoprecipitation using anti-DNA polymerase alpha antibody, Rb protein in nuclear extract of Raji cells was co-precipitated with DNA polymerase alpha. This result indicates that DNA polymerase alpha exists as a complex containing phosphorylated Rb protein in cells. DNA polymerase alpha specifically bound to a purified Rb protein-immobilized Sepharose column. Rb protein also bound to DNA polymerase alpha trapped to anti-DNA polymerase alpha antibody-Sepharose column, suggesting the direct association of these two proteins. These observations suggest a new function of phosphorylated Rb protein in the regulation of DNA replication.
10579934	Intranuclear relocalization of matrix binding sites during T cell activation detected by amplified fluorescence in situ hybridization.	"We describe a method for analyzing the nuclear localization of specific DNA sequences, with special emphasis on their binding status to the nuclear matrix, depending on the developmental stage of the cells. This method employs high-resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization procedures. For our studies, it was important to examine the nuclear localization of a particular gene locus. Previously, however, it was not possible to detect a single-copy genomic sequence using a DNA probe less than several kilobases in size. We describe here a signal amplification technique based on tyramide which makes such a task possible. Using this method, we monitored single-copy loci using a short, 509-bp DNA sequence that binds in vivo to the T cell factor SATB1 within T cell nuclei, high-salt-extracted nuclei (histone-depleted nuclei generating ""halos"" with distended chromatin loops), and the nuclear matrix, before and after T cell activation. We found that these loci were anchored onto the nuclear matrix, creating new bases of chromatin loops, only after T cell activation. This experimental strategy, therefore, enabled us to detect the changes in higher order chromatin structure upon activation and study gene regulation at a new dimension: the loop domain structure. The methods shown here can be widely applied to explore other functions involving chromatin, including recombination and replication."
11033083	FR900482 class of anti-tumor drugs cross-links oncoprotein HMG I/Y to DNA in vivo.	BACKGROUND: Overexpression of the high-mobility group, HMG I/Y, family of chromatin oncoproteins has been implicated as a clinical diagnostic marker for both neoplastic cellular transformation and increased metastatic potential of several human cancers. These minor groove DNA-binding oncoproteins are thus an attractive target for anti-tumor chemotherapy. FR900482 represents a new class of anti-tumor agents that bind to the minor groove of DNA and exhibit greatly reduced host toxicity compared to the structurally related mitomycin C class of anti-tumor drugs. We report covalent cross-linking of DNA to HMG I/Y by FR900482 in vivo which represents the first example of a covalent DNA-drug-protein cross-link with a minor groove-binding oncoprotein and a potential novel mechanism through which these compounds exert their anti-tumor activity. RESULTS: Using a modified chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure, fragments of DNA that have been covalently cross-linked by FR900482 to HMG I/Y proteins in vivo were polymerase chain reaction-amplified, isolated and characterized. The nuclear samples from control cells were devoid of DNA fragments whereas the nuclear samples from cells treated with FR900482 contained DNA fragments which were cross-linked by the drug to the minor groove-binding HMG I/Y proteins in vivo. Additional control experiments established that the drug also cross-linked other non-oncogenic minor groove-binding proteins (HMG-1 and HMG-2) but did not cross-link major groove-binding proteins (Elf-1 and NFkappaB) in vivo. Our results are the first demonstration that FR900482 cross-links a number of minor groove-binding proteins in vivo and suggests that the cross-linking of the HMG I/Y oncoproteins may participate in the mode of efficacy as a chemotherapeutic agent. CONCLUSIONS: We have illustrated that the FR class of anti-tumor antibiotics, represented in this study by FR900482, is able to produce covalent cross-links between the HMG I/Y oncoproteins and DNA in vivo. The ability of this class of compounds to cross-link the HMG I/Y proteins in the minor groove of DNA represents the first demonstration of drug-induced cross-linking of a specific cancer-related protein to DNA in living cells. We have also demonstrated that FR900482 cross-links other minor groove-binding proteins (HMG-1 and HMG-2 in the present study) in vivo; however, since HMG I/Y is the only minor groove-binding oncoprotein presently known, it is possible that these non-histone chromatin proteins are among the important in vivo targets of this family of drugs. These compounds have already been assessed as representing a compelling clinical replacement for mitomycin C due to their greatly reduced host toxicity and superior DNA interstrand cross-linking efficacy. The capacity of FR900482 to cross-link the HMG I/Y oncoprotein with nuclear DNA in vivo potentially represents a significant elucidation of the anti-tumor efficacy of this family of anticancer agents.
11106740	Chromatin opening of DNA satellites by targeted sequence-specific drugs.	There are few tools available for dissecting and elucidating the functions of DNA satellites and other nongenic DNA. To address this, we have explored the experimental potential of DNA sequence-specific drugs containing pyrrole and imidazole amino acids (polyamides). Compounds were synthesized that target different Drosophila melanogaster satellites. Dimeric oligopyrroles were shown to target the AT-rich satellites I, III, and SARs (scaffold associated regions). One polyamide (P31) specifically binds the GAGAA satellite V. Specificity of targeting was established by footprinting, epifluorescence of nuclei, and polytene chromosomes stained with fluorescent derivatives. These polyamides were shown to mediate satellite-specific chromatin opening of the chromatin fiber. Remarkably, certain polyamides induced defined gain or loss-of-function phenotypes when fed to Drosophila melanogaster.
11296170	Effect of ischemic preconditioning on myocardial protection in coronary artery bypass graft patients : can the free radicals act as a trigger for ischemic preconditioning?	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the interrelationship of free radicals (FRs), ischemic preconditioning (IP), and hemodynamic function in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patients. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, and controlled clinical study. PATIENTS: Forty CABG patients were randomized into an IP group (n = 20) and a control group (n = 20). INTERVENTION: The IP group was preconditioned with two cycles of two-min ischemia followed by 3-min reperfusion before cross-clamping. MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: FR content in coronary sinus blood was measured directly using alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone-electron spin-trapped spectroscopy. A small amount of FRs was generated after the IP protocol (5.6% above the baseline) but not in control subjects. A larger amount was generated 10 min after declamping in both groups (8.4% in IP protocol and 7.7% in control subjects). Hemodynamic function recovered better in the IP group at 1 h and 6 h after declamping. There was a significant negative correlation between FR generation after declamping and left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) at 1 h and 6 h after declamping (r = -0.71 and - 0.59, respectively) in the control subjects but not in the IP group. There was a significant positive correlation between FR generation after the IP protocol and cardiac index at 1 h and 6 h (r = 0.50 and 0.61, respectively) and LVSWI at 1 h and 6 h (r = 0.56 and 0.54, respectively) after declamping in the IP group but not in the control subjects. CONCLUSION: FR generation after the operation correlates with ventricular functional depression in CABG patients. IP protects the stunning heart but does not alter FR generation. The association of better hemodynamic recovery after CABG with FR generation during the IP period suggests that FRs might act as one of the triggers for IP.
11574687	Specific distribution of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone homolog HHO1p in the chromatin.	In virtually all eukaryotic organisms, linker DNA between nucleosomes is associated with a histone termed linker histone or histone H1. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, HHO1 encodes a putative linker histone with very significant homology to histone H1. The encoded protein is expressed in the nucleus, but has not been shown to affect global chromatin structure, nor has its deletion shown any detectable phenotype. In vitro chromatin assembly experiments with recombinant HHO1p have shown that it is able to complex with dinuncleosomes in a similar manner to histone H1. Here we report that while disruption of HHO1 has little affect on RNA levels of most cellular transcripts, there are numerous exceptions. Measurement of HHO1p concentration in the wild-type cell showed a stoichiometry of about one HHO1p molecule per 37 nucleosomes. Localization of HHO1p in the chromatin, using an immunoprecipitation technique, showed preferential HHO1p binding to rDNA sequences. These results suggest that HHO1p may play a similar role to linker histones, but at restricted locations in the chromatin.
11673469	c-Myc mediates activation of the cad promoter via a post-RNA polymerase II recruitment mechanism.	The c-Myc protein is a site-specific DNA-binding transcription factor that is up-regulated in a number of different cancers. We have previously shown that binding of Myc correlates with increased transcription of the cad promoter. We have now further investigated the mechanism by which Myc mediates transcriptional activation of the cad gene. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we found high levels of RNA polymerase II bound to the cad promoter in quiescent NIH 3T3 cells and in differentiated U937 cells, even though the promoter is inactive. However, chromatin immunoprecipitation with an antibody that recognizes the hyperphosphorylated form of the RNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) revealed that phosphorylation of the CTD does correlate with c-Myc binding and cad transcription. We have also found that the c-Myc transactivation domain interacts with cdk9 and cyclin T1, components of the CTD kinase P-TEFb. Furthermore, activator bypass experiments have shown that direct recruitment of cyclin T1 to the cad promoter can substitute for c-Myc to activate the promoter. In summary, our results suggest that c-Myc activates transcription of cad by stimulating promoter clearance and elongation, perhaps via recruitment of P-TEFb.
11700282	Chromatin insulators and boundaries: effects on transcription and nuclear organization.	Chromatin boundaries and insulators are transcriptional regulatory elements that modulate interactions between enhancers and promoters and protect genes from silencing effects by the adjacent chromatin. Originally discovered in Drosophila, insulators have now been found in a variety of organisms, ranging from yeast to humans. They have been found interspersed with regulatory sequences in complex genes and at the boundaries between active and inactive chromatin. Insulators might modulate transcription by organizing the chromatin fiber within the nucleus through the establishment of higher-order domains of chromatin structure.
11844796	Role of de novo DNA methyltransferases and methyl CpG-binding proteins in gene silencing in a rat hepatoma.	The expression of metallothionein-I (MT-I), a known antioxidant, was suppressed in a transplanted rat hepatoma because of promoter methylation and was induced by heavy metals only after demethylation by 5-azacytidine (5-AzaC). Treatment of the tumor-bearing rats with 5-AzaC resulted in significant regression of the hepatoma. When the inhibitor-treated tumor was allowed to grow in a new host, MT-I promoter was remethylated, which suggested de novo methylation. The activities of both de novo (3-fold) and maintenance DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) (5-fold) were higher in the hepatoma than in the host liver. The mRNA levels of the de novo methyltransferases DNMT3a and DNMT3b were 3- and 6-fold higher, respectively, in the tumor implicating transcriptional up-regulation of these two genes in this tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis showed exclusive localization of DNMT3a in the nuclei of both the liver and hepatoma, whereas DNMT3b was detected in the nuclei as well as the cytoplasm. Immunoblot assay showed that the levels of DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b proteins in the hepatoma were 5-, 10-, and 4-fold higher, respectively, than in the liver. The mRNA level of the major methyl CpG-binding protein (MeCP2) was 8-fold higher in the tumor compared with the liver. Immunohistochemical studies showed that MeCP2 is localized exclusively in the nuclei of both tissues. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that MeCP2 was associated with the MT-I promoter in the hepatoma implicating its involvement in repressing the methylated promoter. Analysis of the DNA isolated from the liver and hepatoma by RLGS-M (restriction landmark genomic scanning with methylation-sensitive enzyme) (NotI) showed that many genes in addition to MT-I were methylated in the hepatoma. These data demonstrate suppression of the MT-I gene and probably other genes in a solid tumor by promoter methylation and have provided potential molecular mechanisms for the altered methylation profile of the genes in this tumor.
12055182	Silencing of the mouse H-rev107 gene encoding a class II tumor suppressor by CpG methylation.	H-rev107 is a tumor suppressor originally isolated in revertants of H-ras-transformed cell lines. The gene is ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues but down-regulated in primary carcinomas or in many cell lines derived from tumors, including WEHI 7.1 lymphoma cells. Here, we show that unlike in H-rev107-expressing cells or tissues the 5'-end of H-rev107 containing a CpG-rich region of 421 bp is highly methylated in WEHI 7.1 lymphoma cells, correlating with silencing of this gene. Repression of H-rev107 transcription in these cells could be relieved by chemically induced hypomethylation with 5-aza-dC. In addition, upon in vitro methylation, expression of the luciferase reporter gene driven by the H-rev107 promoter decreased by 80% in WEHI 7.1 and 293 cells. Furthermore, co-transfection of the methyl-CpG binding proteins, MeCP2 and MBD2, inhibited H-rev107 promoter activity up to 70% in SL2 cells when the promoter was methylated. By chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we observed in vivo binding of MeCP2 and MBD2 to the 5'-end of H-rev107 in WEHI 7.1 cells, which was reduced to undetectable levels upon 5-aza-dC treatment, concluding that MeCP2 and MBD2 might be involved in silencing the methylated H-rev107 gene in lymphoma cells and probably certain tumors.
12167706	Regulation of alpha-fetoprotein expression by Nkx2.8.	The alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene is an important model of developmental gene silencing and neoplastic gene reactivation. Nkx2.8 is a divergent homeodomain factor originally cloned through its binding to the promoter-coupling element (PCE), a regulatory region upstream of the AFP promoter that mediates stimulation by distant enhancers. Nkx2.8 is the only developmentally regulated factor that has been associated with AFP gene expression. Fetoprotein transcription factor, an orphan nuclear receptor, has also been shown to bind the PCE but is not developmentally regulated. The binding specificities of both families of transcription factor were determined, and overlapping sites for each were defined in the PCE. After modification of nuclear extract and gel shift analysis procedures, Nkx2.8 was identified in six AFP-positive cell lines. Transient-transfection analysis did not show transcriptional stimulation by Nkx2.8 or other active NK2 factors, which only interfered with gene expression. However, two sets of analysis demonstrated the relationship of Nkx2.8 to AFP expression: chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Nkx2.8 bound to the active AFP promoter, and antisense inhibition of Nkx2.8 mRNA translation selectively reduced expression of both the endogenous human AFP gene and transfected reporters containing the rat AFP promoter.
12415115	Identification of E2A target genes in B lymphocyte development by using a gene tagging-based chromatin immunoprecipitation system.	The transcription factors encoded by the E2A gene are known to be essential for B lymphocyte development, and ectopic expression or gene inactivation studies have revealed several potential lineage-specific E2A target genes. However, it remains unknown whether these target genes are directly regulated by E2A at the transcriptional level. We therefore generated mice carrying an affinity-tagged E2A knock-in allele to provide a system for the direct elucidation of E2A target genes based on E2A binding to target regulatory regions. Abelson-transformed pre-B cell lines derived from these mice were used in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments to identify regulatory sequences bound by E2A in the context of an early B lymphocyte environment. Significant E2A binding was detected at the promoters and enhancers of several essential B-lineage genes, including the Igkappa intronic and 3' enhancers, lambda5 and VpreB surrogate light chain promoters, the EBF locus promoter region, and the mb-1 (Igalpha) promoter. Low levels of E2A binding were observed at several other lymphoid-restricted regulatory regions including the Ig heavy chain (IgH) intronic enhancer, the IgH 3' enhancers hs3b/hs4, the RAG-2 enhancer, and the 5' regions of the B29 and TdT loci. An E2A target gene, the predicted butyrophilin-like gene NG9 (BTL-II), was also identified by using a chromatin immunoprecipitation-based cloning strategy. In summary, our studies have provided evidence that E2A is directly involved in the transcriptional regulation of a number of early B-lineage genes.
12500542	[Identification of two new p53 target genes through implementation of the modified chromatin immunoprecipitation method and inverse PCR].	Direct target loci for the transcription factor p53 were identified through the employment of a combination of a modified version of chromosomal immunoprecipitation and inverse PCR. Irradiation of Hela cells to drive DNA damage response was followed by sequential chromosomal immunoprecipitation utilizing antibodies which recognize the large subunit of RNA polymerase II and p53. Inverse PCR with degenerate oligonucleotides specific for the p53 binding site was subsequently performed on immunoprecipitated DNA and fragments containing putative p53 target genes were subcloned and sequenced. Two sequences were identified which contain near-consensus p53 binding sites as well as recognition sites for the core transcriptional machinery including RNA polymerase II and Sp1. Cotransfections of vectors containing these sequences linked to a reporter with p53 expression vectors resulted in stimulation of transcription. Application of the technology described herein may result in the identification of target loci for a wide variety of transcription factors.
12533679	Identification of the polycomb group protein SU(Z)12 as a potential molecular target for human cancer therapy.	We have previously identified SU(Z)12 as an E2F target gene. Because many E2F target genes encode proteins that are critical for the control of cell proliferation, we have further characterized the regulation and expression of SU(Z)12. To understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for expression of SU(Z)12 mRNA, we have analyzed the promoter region. We found that the SU(Z)12 gene is controlled by dual promoters, one of which functions bidirectionally. In addition to the E2F binding site, we have identified two binding sites for T cell factor (TCF)/beta-catenin complexes. Using gel mobility shift assays, we demonstrated that both TCF sites can be bound by TCF4. TCF/beta-catenin complexes have been shown to be a critical regulator of gene expression in tumors of the colon, breast, and liver. Accordingly, we have used chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to confirm that TCF4/beta-catenin complexes are bound to the SU(Z)12 promoter in colon cancer cells but not in HeLa cells. We next adapted the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay for use with primary colon tumor samples, and, using matched pairs of normal and tumor tissue obtained from several different colon cancer patients, we demonstrate that levels of beta-catenin bound to the SU(Z)12 promoter are increased in colon tumors. Finally, we show that the SU(Z)12 mRNA is up-regulated in a number of different human tumors, including tumors of the colon, breast, and liver. Recent studies have found that SU(Z)12 is a component of the Drosophila ESC-E(Z) and the human EED-EZH2 Polycomb chromatin remodeling complexes. Therefore, we suggest that SU(Z)12, which may modulate the tumor phenotype by changing gene expression profiles, may be a logical target for the design of a new antitumor agent
12657609	Kinetics of retinal lipoprotein precipitation and elimination after closure of subretinal new vessels.	PURPOSE: To study the kinetics of retinal precipitation and elimination of lipoprotein in relation to photodynamic therapy of subretinal new vessels. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study of subretinal precipitate before and after photodynamic therapy for subfoveal new vessels secondary to age-related macular degeneration in 14 eyes demonstrating precipitate at one or more visits, using digital red-free gray-scale fundus photography, intravenous fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography, and morphometric mapping. RESULTS: In 14 eyes of 14 patients, the area covered by lipoprotein precipitate increased from a mean of 0.54 optic disc areas (range, 0-2.61) before treatment to a mean of 0.65 optic disc areas (range, 0.01-3.04) at 45 d after treatment (P = 0.18). Eyes with a serous detachment at baseline, before the initial treatment (n = 10) demonstrated more treatment-related precipitation than eyes without a serous detachment at baseline (n = 4; P = 0.034). Two eyes with a large amount of precipitate and a long follow-up demonstrated net elimination of precipitate from approximately 100 days after the initial treatment, with uniexponential precipitate half-lives of 43 and 32 days. CONCLUSIONS: Photodynamic therapy for subfoveal new vessels may be associated with retinal precipitation of lipoprotein, presumably because early extraction of water and salts from the subretinal fluid increases the concentration of leaked plasma proteins. Despite reperfusion of the subretinal vessels, macromolecular leakage appears to cease within 100 days, indicating that functional maturation of the new vessels has occurred, with an associated decrease in pore size.
12799440	Histone deacetylase inhibition is associated with transcriptional repression of the Hmga2 gene.	The high-mobility-group A2 protein (HMGA2) plays important functional roles in transcriptional regulation, DNA replication and chromatin structure. In this study, the effect of histone deacetylase inhibition on the transcriptional activity of the Hmga2 gene was investigated in vivo both at the endogenous gene level and in a variety of cell lines using transiently transfected promoter constructs. Trichostatin A (TSA) repressed both transfected murine and human Hmga2 promoter constructs 3-8-fold in NIH3T3, F9 and HeLa cells. Steady-state Hmga2 mRNA levels in NIH3T3 cells decreased 4-5-fold following TSA treatment, while pre- treatment of NIH3T3 cells with the transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin D, completely blocked TSA mediated repression of the Hmga2 gene. Cross-linked chromatin immunoprecipitation (X-ChIP) analysis revealed a 5-6-fold decrease in endogenous Hmga2 promoter bound Sp1 and Sp3 proteins following TSA treatment in parallel with observed loss of acetylated histone H3 and H4. In addition, the poly-pyrimidine-tract-binding protein (PTB) was observed to bind to the Hmga2 promoter in both TSA treated and untreated NIH3T3 cells. Together, these results suggest TSA treatment leads to a decrease in Hmga2 gene transcription, and a significant decrease in promoter bound Sp1, Sp3 and acetylated histones H3 and H4.
9230703	A preparative method for crosslinking proteins to DNA in nuclei by single-pulse UV laser irradiation.	Photocrosslinking of proteins to DNA by single-pulse UV laser has been used only in analytical experiments, carried out with reconstituted complexes of a single DNA binding protein and a labeled target sequence. Here we propose a large-scale technique for irradiation of nuclei, generating preparative quantities of covalently linked protein-DNA complexes for further analysis of the partner molecules. The use of a flow cuvette allows a milligram of DNA in either nuclei or chromatin to be irradiated by a single pulse within few minutes. The efficiency of crosslinking varies from 6 to 12% of the total nuclear proteins. The presence of histones and other chromosomal proteins in the crosslinked protein-DNA complexes was demonstrated by using specific antibodies. The irradiation procedure can be fully automated using a microcomputer.
9642275	Cell cycle- and chromatin binding state-dependent phosphorylation of human MCM heterohexameric complexes. A role for cdc2 kinase.	The mammalian MCM protein family, presently with six members, exists in the nuclei in two forms, chromatin-bound and unbound. The former dissociates from chromatin with progression through the S phase. Recently, we have established a procedure to isolate chromatin-bound and unbound complexes containing all six human MCM (hMCM) proteins by immunoprecipitation. In the present study, we applied this procedure to HeLa cells synchronized in each of the G1, S, and G2/M phases and could detect hMCM heterohexameric complexes in all three. In addition, depending on the cell cycle and the state of chromatin association, hMCM2 and 4 in the complexes were found to variously change their phosphorylation states. Concentrating attention on G2/M phase hyperphosphorylation, we found hMCM2 and 4 in the complexes to be good substrates for cdc2/cyclin B in vitro. Furthermore, when cdc2 kinase was inactivated in temperature-sensitive mutant murine FT210 cells, the G2/M hyperphosphorylation of the murine MCM2 and MCM4 and release of the MCMs from chromatin in the G2 phase were severely impaired. Taken together, the data suggest that the six mammalian MCM proteins function and undergo cell cycle-dependent regulation as heterohexameric complexes and that phosphorylation of the complexes by cdc2 kinase may be one of mechanisms negatively regulating the MCM complex-chromatin association.
10591994	Subnuclear distribution of the entire complement of linker histone variants in Arabidopsis thaliana.	Linker histones (e.g. H1, H5, H1 degrees ) are thought to exert control on chromatin function by restricting nucleosomal dynamics. All higher eukaryotes possess a diverse family of linker histones, which may exhibit functional specialization. Arabidopsis thaliana apparently contains a minimal complement of linker histone structural variants and therefore is an ideal model for investigating functional differentiation among linker histones. Histones H1-1 and H1-2 are relatively similar proteins that are expressed in a wide variety of tissues and make up the majority of linker histone while H1-3 is a highly divergent minor variant protein that is induced by drought stress. We are interested in determining whether the in vivo distribution of each of these proteins also differs. To this end, we have produced subtype-specific antibodies and have localized each of the three proteins at the intranuclear and DNA sequence levels by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, respectively. Antibodies against linker histones H1-1 and H1-2 decorate nuclei in patterns very similar to 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, but different than the staining pattern of total histones. In contrast, antibodies made against two regions of H1-3 bind to chromatin in a diffuse pattern distinct from the DAPI-staining pattern. We also describe a technique to determine the localization of plant linker histone variants along regions of chromatin, employing in vivo chemical DNA-protein cross-linking to preserve native associations followed by immunoprecipitation with subtype-specific antibodies. We use this technique to demonstrate that, in contrast to the major linker histones, H1-3 does not bind the repetitive sequences pAL1 and 5S rDNA. In addition, we show that linker histones are bound to the compacted nucleosomal arrays at the telomere but with reduced stoichiometry. Taken together, our results suggest that plants, as has been shown for animals, possess a variant linker histone that is differentially localized.
10594348	An efficient method for simultaneous isolation of biologically active transcription factors and DNA.	Transcription factors play a crucial role in gene regulation during different stages of eukaryotic development as well as in controlling various cellular disorders involving the immune system. In order to study the role of cellular DNAs and the effects of certain biologically active regulatory proteins, which can affect gene expression, we have developed a rapid and efficient method for preparing highly purified DNAs as well as nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, simultaneously. These DNAs and proteins can be effectively analyzed to determine their genetic integrity and binding motifs to specific DNA sequences, respectively. This protocol avoids the drastic use of mechanical shearing of cells, aggressive use of detergents or high speed ultracentrifugation steps, as well as facilitating the ease of collecting samples in a sequential and effective manner with minimal time lapse during processing. Such an approach permits the analysis of a large number of samples in a short time. The current technique uses a non-ionic detergent to isolate nuclei, and obtain the cytosolic extract, a low-ionic strength buffer to wash off the detergent and a high-salt buffer to extract nuclear proteins including transcription factors. The remainder of the cellular products are processed for DNA extraction. This method will be particularly useful to evaluate the time course effects of various cell signal transducing biological modifiers such as cytokines or mitogens, as well as drugs used in therapy, especially in infectious diseases and also in immunological or neoplastic disorders, with minimal physical contact to the laboratory personnel. This rapid DNA and protein isolation method can be widely used in various systems to analyze the modulation of DNA characteristics and transcriptionally active proteins as biomarkers in different human diseases.
10801889	Histone H2A.Z is widely but nonrandomly distributed in chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster.	Variant histones that differ in amino acid sequence from S-phase histones are widespread in eukaryotes, yet the structural changes they cause to nucleosomes and how those changes affect relevant cellular processes have not been determined. H2A.F/Z is a highly conserved family of H2A variants. H2Av, the H2A.F/Z variant of Drosophila melanogaster, was localized in polytene chromosomes by indirect immunofluorescence and in diploid chromosomes by chromatin immunoprecipitation. H2Av was widely distributed in the genome and not limited to sites of active transcription. H2Av was present in thousands of euchromatic bands and the heterochromatic chromocenter of polytene chromosomes, and the H2Av antibody precipitated both transcribed and nontranscribed genes as well as noncoding euchromatic and heterochromatic sequences. The distribution of H2Av was not uniform. The complex banding pattern of H2Av in polytene chromosomes did not parallel the concentration of DNA, as did the pattern of immunofluorescence using H2A antibodies, and the density of H2Av measured by immunoprecipitation varied between different sequences. Of the sequences assayed, H2Av was least abundant on 1. 688 satellite sequences and most abundant on the hsp70 genes. Finally, transcription caused, to an equivalent extent, both H2Av and H2A to be less tightly associated with DNA.
10956666	Rad22 protein, a rad52 homologue in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, binds to DNA double-strand breaks.	DNA double-strand breaks can be introduced by exogenous agents or during normal cellular processes. Genes belonging to the RAD52 epistasis group are known to repair these breaks in budding yeast. Among these genes, RAD52 plays a central role in homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. Despite its importance, its mechanism of action is not yet clear. It is known, however, that the human homologue of Rad52 is capable of binding to DNA ends in vitro. Herein, we show that Rad22 protein, a Rad52 homologue in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, can similarly bind to DNA ends at double-strand breaks. This end-binding ability was demonstrated in vitro by electron microscopy and by protection from exonuclease attack. We also showed that Rad22 specifically binds near double-strand break associated with mating type switching in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. This is the first evidence that a recombinational protein directly binds to DNA double-strand breaks in vivo.
11158302	Acetylation of a specific promoter nucleosome accompanies activation of the epsilon-globin gene by beta-globin locus control region HS2.	On stably replicating episomes, transcriptional activation of the epsilon-globin promoter by the beta-globin locus control region HS2 enhancer is correlated with an increase in nuclease sensitivity which is limited to the TATA-proximal nucleosome (N1). To elucidate what underlies this increase in nuclease sensitivity and the link between chromatin modification and gene expression, we examined the nucleoprotein composition and histone acetylation status of transcriptionally active and inactive promoters. Micrococcal nuclease digestion of active promoters in nuclei released few nucleosome-like nucleoprotein complexes containing N1 sequences in comparison to results with inactive promoters. We also observed that N1 DNA fragments from active promoters are of a subnucleosomal length. Nevertheless, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that histones H3 and H4 are present on N1 sequences from active promoters, with H3 being dramatically hyperacetylated compared with that from inactive promoters and vector sequences. Strikingly, H3 in the adjacent upstream nucleosome (N2) does not appear to be differentially acetylated in active and inactive promoters, indicating that the nucleosome modification of the promoter that accompanies transactivation by HS2 is highly directed and specific. However, global acetylation of histones in vivo by trichostatin A did not activate transcription in the absence of HS2, suggesting that HS2 contributes additional activities necessary for transactivation. N1 sequences from active promoters also contain reduced levels of linker histone H1. The detection of a protected subnucleosomal sized N1 DNA fragment and the recovery of N1 DNA sequences in immunoprecipitations using anti-acetylated H3 and H4 antibodies argue that N1 is present, but in an altered conformation, in the active promoters.
11164922	Rapid method for the isolation of full length adenoviral genomes by bacterial intermolecular homologous recombination.	Recombinant adenoviruses are used widely in gene therapy research. Much work has been carried out to remove specific components of the wild type adenovirus (e.g. E1 gene) in order to make them safer for human use. In addition to such efforts, it is vitally important to ensure that the production of recombinant adenoviruses meet safety guidelines not only with regard to the absence of replication competent adenoviruses but for other variant species that may be present in a viral preparation. In this report, a time and cost efficient method is described for the isolation of full length adenovirus genomes without resorting to plaque purification. The procedure uses a bacterial homologous recombination system and results in the conversion of the double-stranded linear adenovirus genome into a circularized plasmid form that can be easily analyzed by restriction digestion, PCR, DNA sequencing or used in transient transfection studies. Also, the adenovirus plasmids that are generated may also be rescued back into virus form if needed. The entire procedure takes 4 days or less instead of weeks that plaque purification or dilution cloning requires. Furthermore, the method does not require the use of tissue culture materials or facilities. More importantly, this procedure allows for a more extensive and thorough examination of any viral preparation, since it allows for the detection of variants incapable of propagation without the assistance of co-infecting intact adenoviral genomes. Under standard conditions of plaque purification, these variant genomes are not detected. It is predicted that far more variant genomes will be observed using this rapid method than would otherwise be detected by standard plaque purification methods.
11267833	Diversity of the damage recognition step in the global genomic nucleotide excision repair in vitro.	The XPC-HR23B complex, a mammalian factor specifically involved in global genomic nucleotide excision repair (NER) has been shown to bind various forms of damaged DNA and initiate DNA repair in cell-free reactions. To characterize the binding specificity of this factor in more detail, a method based on immunoprecipitation was developed to assess the relative affinity of XPC-HR23B for defined lesions on DNA. Here we show that XPC-HR23B preferentially binds to UV-induced (6-4) photoproducts (6-4PPs) as well as to cholesterol, but not to the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD), 8-oxoguanine (8-oxo-G), O6-methylguanine (O6-Me-G), or a single mismatch. Human whole cell extracts could efficiently excise 6-4PPs and cholesterol in an XPC-HR23B-dependent manner, but not 8-oxo-G, O6-Me-G or mismatches. Thus, there was good correlation between the binding specificity of XPC-HR23B for certain types of lesion and the ability of human cell extracts to excise these lesions, supporting the model that XPC-HR23B initiates global genomic NER. Although, XPC-HR23B does not preferentially bind to CPDs, the excision of CPDs in human whole cell extracts was found to be absolutely dependent on XPC-HR23B, in agreement with the in vivo observation that CPDs are not removed from the global genome in XP-C mutant cells. These results suggest that, in addition to the excision repair pathway initiated by XPC-HR23B, there exists another sub-pathway for the global genomic NER that still requires XPC-HR23B but is not initiated by XPC-HR23B. Possible mechanisms will be discussed.
11279041	The chromatin structure of the dual c-myc promoter P1/P2 is regulated by separate elements.	The proto-oncogene c-myc is transcribed from a dual promoter P1/P2, with transcription initiation sites 160 base pairs apart. Here we have studied the transcriptional activation of both promoters on chromatin templates. c-myc chromatin was reconstituted on stably transfected, episomal, Epstein-Barr virus-derived vectors in a B cell line. Episomal P1 and P2 promoters showed only basal activity but were strongly inducible by histone deacetylase inhibitors. The effect of promoter mutations on c-myc activity, chromatin structure, and E2F binding was studied. The ME1a1 binding site between P1 and P2 was required for the maintenance of an open chromatin configuration of the dual c-myc promoters. Mutation of this site strongly reduced the sensitivity of the core promoter region of P1/P2 to micrococcal nuclease and prevented binding of polymerase II (pol II) at the P2 promoter. In contrast, mutation of the P2 TATA box also abolished binding of pol II at the P2 promoter but did not affect the chromatin structure of the P1/P2 core promoter region. The E2F binding site adjacent to ME1a1 is required for repression of the P2 promoter but not the P1 promoter, likely by recruitment of histone deacetylase activity. Chromatin precipitation experiments with E2F-specific antibodies revealed binding of E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-4 to the E2F site of the c-myc promoter in vivo if the E2F site was intact. Taken together, the analyses support a model with a functional hierarchy for regulatory elements in the c-myc promoter region; binding of proteins to the ME1a1 site provides a nucleosome-free region of chromatin near the P2 start site, binding of E2F results in transcriptional repression without affecting polymerase recruitment, and the TATA box is required for polymerase recruitment.
11355342	Isolation of extrachromosomal elements by histone immunoprecipitation.	Here, we describe a gentle and effective method for the rapid and reproducible isolation of histone-bound extrachromosomal DNA molecules called extrachromosomal elements (EEs). This method facilitates the harvest of a specific population of EEs following their isolation from cultured cells, primary tissues, and tumor cells. Active EEs are bound to histone proteins, and these histone-bound EEs carry actively transcribing genes such as c-myc. Our method exploits the presence of histones on EEs and serves as a first-step purification procedure, allowing for the cloning or multivariant analysis of an immunopurified sample of EEs. We isolated EEs from 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT)-activated Myc-ER-regulatable Pre-B ABM cells. Following one round of immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate the purification of histone-bound EEs. We confirmed that our purification enriched for EEs that carry genes by fluorescent in situ hybridization of EEs (FISH-EEs), and we probed non-enriched and immunopurified EEs with a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) cDNA probe that is known to detect extrachromosomal amplification in Myc-activated cells. We demonstrate the enrichment of immunoprecipitated DHFR-containing extrachromosomal DNA molecules.
11726209	Analysis of chromatin-immunopurified MeCP2-associated fragments.	As molecular biologists, we are continuing to unravel the interactions by which DNA binding proteins mediate the expression of genes. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) technique provides us with an exquisite tool to investigate the interplay between chromatin structure and its role in regulating transcription, replication, and recombination in vivo. We describe a robust assay used to identify the molecular determinants associated with chromatin. In this article we illustrate the ChIP technique and use the transcriptionally silent-hypermethylated multidrug resistance (MDR1) gene as the platform for methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) localization on chromatin. Driven by the hypothesis that repression is strongly dependent on the methylation profile of the endogenous promoter, we demonstrate that MDR1 is targeted by MeCP2. Methylated MDR1 chromatin is highly enriched with MeCP2 and is in striking contrast to localization observed in cells in which MDR1 is transcriptionally active. In a distinct model system we discuss experimental methods used to immunopurify the MeCP2 repressor complex on chromatin and quantify protein-DNA association by competitive PCR approach.
11799066	Isolating human transcription factor targets by coupling chromatin immunoprecipitation and CpG island microarray analysis.	Previously, identification of promoters regulated by mammalian transcription factors has relied upon overexpression studies. Here we present the identification of a large set of promoters that are bound by E2F in physiological conditions. Probing a human CpG microarray with chromatin immunoprecipitated using an antibody to E2F4, we have identified 68 unique target loci; 15% are bidirectional promoters and 25% recruit E2F via a mechanism distinct from the defined consensus site. Interestingly, although E2F has been shown previously to regulate genes involved in cell cycle progression, many of the new E2F target genes encode proteins involved in DNA repair or recombination. We suggest that human CpG microarrays, in combination with chromatin immunoprecipitation, will allow rapid identification of target promoters for many mammalian transcription factors.
11865062	Precipitous release of methyl-CpG binding protein 2 and histone deacetylase 1 from the methylated human multidrug resistance gene (MDR1) on activation.	Overexpression of the human multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) is a negative prognostic factor in leukemia. Despite intense efforts to characterize the gene at the molecular level, little is known about the genetic events that switch on gene expression in P-glycoprotein-negative cells. Recent studies have shown that the transcriptional competence of MDR1 is often closely associated with DNA methylation. Chromatin remodeling and modification targeted by the recognition of methylated DNA provide a dominant mechanism for transcriptional repression. Consistent with this epigenetic model, interference with DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase activity alone or in combination can reactivate silent genes. In the present study, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation to monitor the molecular events involved in the activation and repression of MDR1. Inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase (5-azacytidine [5aC]) and histone deacetylase (trichostatin A [TSA]) were used to examine gene transcription, promoter methylation status, and the chromatin determinants associated with the MDR1 promoter. We have established that methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is involved in methylation-dependent silencing of human MDR1 in cells that lack the known transcriptional repressors MBD2 and MBD3. In the repressed state the MDR1 promoter is methylated and assembled into chromatin enriched with MeCP2 and deacetylated histone. TSA induced significant acetylation of histones H3 and H4 but did not activate transcription. 5aC induced DNA demethylation, leading to the release of MeCP2, promoter acetylation, and partial relief of repression. MDR1 expression was significantly increased following combined 5aC and TSA treatments. Inhibition of histone deacetylase is not an overriding mechanism in the reactivation of methylated MDR1. Our results provide us with a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanism necessary for repression of MDR1.
11940647	Enhanced expression of the transcription factor Nrf2 by cancer chemopreventive agents: role of antioxidant response element-like sequences in the nrf2 promoter.	Induction of phase 2 enzymes, which neutralize reactive electrophiles and act as indirect antioxidants, is an important mechanism for protection against carcinogenesis. The transcription factor Nrf2, which binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) found in the upstream regulatory region of many phase 2 genes, is essential for the induction of these enzymes. We have investigated the effect of the potent enzyme inducer and anticarcinogen 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T) on the fate of Nrf2 in murine keratinocytes. Both total and nuclear Nrf2 levels increased rapidly and persistently after treatment with D3T but could be blocked by cotreatment with cycloheximide. Nrf2 mRNA levels increased approximately 2-fold 6 h after D3T treatment. To examine the transcriptional activation of Nrf2 by D3T, the proximal region (1 kb) of the nrf2 promoter was isolated. Deletion and mutagenesis analyses demonstrated that nrf2 promoter-luciferase reporter activity was enhanced by treatment with D3T and that ARE-like sequences were required for this activation. Gel shift assays with nuclear extracts from PE cells indicated that common factors bind to typical AREs and the ARE-like sequences of the nrf2 promoter. Direct binding of Nrf2 to its own promoter was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Overexpression of Nrf2 increased the activity of the nrf2 promoter-luciferase reporter, while expression of mutant Nrf2 protein repressed activity. Thus, Nrf2 appears to autoregulate its own expression through an ARE-like element located in the proximal region of its promoter, leading to persistent nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 and protracted induction of phase 2 genes in response to chemopreventive agents.
12562764	In vivo cloning and characterization of a new growth suppressor protein TOE1 as a direct target gene of Egr1.	Egr1, an immediate early transcription factor, responds to diverse stimuli and affects gene transcription to accomplish its biological effects. One important effect of Egr1 expression is to decrease the growth and tumorigenic potential of several tumor cell types. To identify important Egr1 target genes, we have adapted a methodology involving formaldehyde-induced protein-DNA cross-linking, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and multiplex PCR. Using this approach, we report the cloning of a new Egr1 target gene that is able to account, at least in part, for the growth inhibitory activity of Egr1. We have named this new protein TOE1 for target of Egr1.
12627232	In vivo characterization of regulatory polymorphisms by allele-specific quantification of RNA polymerase loading.	In vivo characterization of regulatory polymorphisms is a key requirement for next-generation human genetic analysis. Here we describe haploChIP, a method that uses chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and mass spectrometry to identify differential protein-DNA binding in vivo associated with allelic variants of a gene. We demonstrate this approach with the imprinted gene SNRPN. HaploChIP showed close correlation between the level of bound phosphorylated RNA polymerase II at the SNRPN locus and allele-specific expression. Application of the approach to the TNF/LTA locus identified functionally important haplotypes that correlate with allele-specific transcription of LTA. The haploChIP method may be useful in high-throughput screening for common DNA polymorphisms that affect gene regulation in vivo.
12685742	Identification of some plasticizers compounds in landfill leachate.	In this work it was described a simple method for extraction of plasticizer compounds (mainly phthalate esters and bisphenol A (BPA)) from landfill leachate samples. The samples were submitted to an extraction procedures based on precipitation, solid phase extraction (SPE) and ionic exchange chromatography (IEC). Firstly the landfill leachate sample was acidified by addition of HCl concentrated, in order to precipitate the organic compounds that are less soluble in water. The precipitate was washed with several solvents. The aqueous phase was then submitted to SPE with XAD-4 resin and IEC with Amberlyst A-27 resin. The instrumental analysis was performed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometer detector (GC/MSD) and the compounds were identified by the GC/MSD library (Wiley) and by using some standard substances. These methodologies allow the isolation and identification of the following compounds: dioctylphthalate, diisobutilphthalate, BPA, benzoic acid, palmitic acid and diisopentylphthalate. The methods are very simple, rapid and selective, for plasticizers extraction from landfill leachate matrices.
7730396	A possible mechanism for the inhibition of ribosomal RNA gene transcription during mitosis.	"When cells enter mitosis, RNA synthesis ceases. Yet the RNA polymerase I (pol I) transcription machinery involved in the production of pre-rRNA remains bound to the nucleolus organizing region (NOR), the chromosome site harboring the tandemly repeated rRNA genes. Here we examine whether rDNA transcription units are transiently blocked or ""frozen"" during mitosis. By using fluorescent in situ hybridization we were unable to detect nascent pre-rRNA chains on the NORs of mouse 3T3 and rat kangaroo PtK2 cells. Appropriate controls showed that our approach was sensitive enough to visualize, at the light microscopic level, individual transcriptionally active rRNA genes both in situ after experimental unfolding of nucleoli and in chromatin spreads (""Miller spreads""). Analysis of the cell cycle-dependent redistribution of transcript-associated components also revealed that most transcripts are released from the rDNA at mitosis. Upon disintegration of the nucleolus during mitosis, U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and the nucleolar proteins fibrillarin and nucleolin became dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and were excluded from the NORs. Together, our data rule out the presence of ""frozen Christmas-trees"" at the mitotic NORs but are compatible with the view that inactive pol I remains on the rDNA. We propose that expression of the rRNA genes is regulated during mitosis at the level of transcription elongation, similarly to what is known for a number of genes transcribed by pol II. Such a mechanism may explain the decondensed state of the NOR chromatin and the immediate transcriptional reactivation of the rRNA genes following mitosis."
8626478	Identification of novel Pax-2 binding sites by chromatin precipitation.	The Pax genes encode a family of developmental transcription factors that bind to specific DNA sequences via the paired domain and are necessary for the morphogenesis of a variety of tissues. The murine Pax-2 gene, through alternative splicing, encodes two nuclear proteins, Pax-2A and Pax-2B, which are transiently expressed during the differentiation of specific neural cell types and early kidney formation. In order to identify potential in vivo Pax-2 target sequences, chromatin from embryonic neural tube was immunoprecipitated with Pax-2 specific antibodies and cloned. Two unique immunoprecipitated clones containing three specific Pax-2 binding sites were identified by functional binding assays using Pax-2 proteins produced in both Escherichia coli and eukaryotic cells. In vitro DNA binding assays, using Pax-5 and Pax-8 DNA recognition sequences as well as the three immunopurified Pax-2 binding sites, demonstrated that both forms of the Pax-2 protein bind DNA with a similar specificity and that this binding is mediated by the paired domain. The binding sites identified in this report share significant homology among themselves and with previously defined consensus sequences for Pax-5 and Pax-2. The genomic clones can now be used as sequence tags to identify potential target loci.
9212165	In vivo protein-DNA interactions on a glucocorticoid response unit of a liver-specific gene: hormone-induced transcription factor binding to constitutively open chromatin.	Transcription from the liver promoter of a 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2) gene depends on the presence of glucocorticoids that act via a glucocorticoid response unit (GRU) located in the first intron. The promoter and the GRU are in a constitutively open chromatin configuration. To determine how glucocorticoids would affect factor binding to the GRU in absence of chromatin remodeling, we have used a combination of in vitro DNA-binding assays and in vivo genomic footprinting in rat hepatocytes and hepatoma cells. We found that, in the absence of glucocorticoids, the GRU binds nuclear factor-I (NF-I). Glucocorticoid treatment modified factor binding to the NF-I site and induced the binding of hepatocyte nuclear factor-3 (HNF-3). Transfection assays showed that HNF-3 cooperates with the glucocorticoid receptor in stimulating transcription. In contrast with the lack of effect of glucocorticoids on factor binding to constitutively open GRUs of other genes, HNF-3 binding to the open PFK-2 GRU was hormone-dependent. Therefore, the PFK-2 GRU behaves as a novel type of GRU.
9417927	Clusters of nucleosomes containing chromosomal protein HMG-17 in chromatin.	Chromosomal proteins HMG-14 and HMG-17 are nucleosome binding proteins which can function as architectural elements to alter the structure of the chromatin fiber and enhance transcription from chromatin templates. Here we study the spatial organization of these HMG proteins in the nucleus and the distribution of nucleosomes containing HMG-17 in the chromatin fiber. By confocal immunofluorescence microscopy we find that HMG-14/17 proteins are clustered into foci containing either HMG-14 or HMG-17. These results suggest that HMG-14/17 proteins segregate into distinct nuclear domains. Indeed, immunofractionation of defined length oligonucleosomes, with affinity pure antibodies to HMG-17, indicates that oligonucleosomes containing HMG-17 are devoid of HMG-14. Quantitative analysis indicates that in cellular chromatin nucleosomes containing HMG-17 are clustered. The average size of the cluster is six contiguous HMG-17-containing nucleosomes. The nucleosomes in this cluster contain either two or zero molecules of HMG-17 and a complete set of four core histones. We suggest that HMG-14/17 proteins modify the nucleosomal organization of the 30 nm chromatin fiber, to unfold the higher order chromatin structure and facilitate access to the underlying DNA sequence. Clustering of architectural elements, such as HMG proteins and linker histone subtypes into distinct domains, may lead to structural and functional heterogeneity along the chromatin fiber.
9601011	Heritable chromatin states induced by the Polycomb and trithorax group genes.	In Drosophila the Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (trxG) genes are required to maintain differential expression patterns of many important developmental regulatory genes. The PcG is responsible for heritable silencing throughout development. At target genes PcG response elements (PREs) attract PcG protein complexes and induce the formation of higher-order chromatin structures. We have mapped the distribution of Polycomb and other PcG members at various target genes by using an improved formaldehyde cross-linking and chromatin immunoprecipitation technique. We find that Polycomb spreads locally from PREs over several kilobases, thereby probably stabilizing the silencing complexes. Members of the trxG co-localize at PREs. GAGA factor was found to be constitutively bound to PREs independently of gene activity. PREs associated with active genes appear to have increased amounts of bound GAGA. We have developed a system capable of switching a PRE between the on/off modes. PREs and trxG-regulated elements are common chromosomal elements through which the proteins of the PcG/trxG exert their maintenance function on adjacent chromatin structures.
9815165	Water-soluble conjugate of double-stranded DNA and Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) for one-pot affinity precipitation separation of DNA-binding proteins.	Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) having a terminal psoralen group was synthesized and covalently bound to plasmid pBR 322 DNA through a photochemical reaction. The resulting conjugate exhibited temperature-responsive precipitation due to the aggregation of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) chains when heated above 31 degreesC. This system was used for the one-pot separation of restriction endonuclease EcoRI.
10523648	Structural and functional cross-talk between a distant enhancer and the epsilon-globin gene promoter shows interdependence of the two elements in chromatin.	We investigated the requirements for enhancer-promoter communication by using the human beta-globin locus control region (LCR) DNase I-hypersensitive site 2 (HS2) enhancer and the epsilon-globin gene in chromatinized minichromosomes in erythroid cells. Activation of globin genes during development is accompanied by localized alterations of chromatin structure, and CACCC binding factors and GATA-1, which interact with both globin promoters and the LCR, are believed to be critical for globin gene transcription activation. We found that an HS2 element mutated in its GATA motif failed to remodel the epsilon-globin promoter or activate transcription yet HS2 nuclease accessibility did not change. Accessibility and transcription were reduced at promoters with mutated GATA-1 or CACCC sites. Strikingly, these mutations also resulted in reduced accessibility at HS2. In the absence of a globin gene, HS2 is similarly resistant to nuclease digestion. In contrast to observations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, HS2-dependent promoter remodeling was diminished when we mutated the TATA box, crippling transcription. This mutation also reduced HS2 accessibility. The results indicate that the epsilon-globin promoter and HS2 interact both structurally and functionally and that both upstream activators and the basal transcription apparatus contribute to the interaction. Further, at least in this instance, transcription activation and promoter remodeling by a distant enhancer are not separable.
10579484	Molecular genetic analysis of the drought-inducible linker histone variant in Arabidopsis thaliana.	Linker histones are ubiquitous structural components of chromatin that have been shown to influence the expression of a subset of genes in diverse organisms. Plants contain a minor linker histone variant that is expressed in most tissues of all organs, and is induced during drought stress. Based on reporter gene analysis in roots, His1-3 is expressed almost exclusively in emerging secondary roots in unstressed plants, but is primarily expressed in the root meristem and elongation zone of stressed plants. In shoots, expression is higher in younger tissues than older tissues. In order to investigate the function of H1-3, we have generated lines with altered levels of H1-3. Plants expressing an antisense His1-3 transcript exhibit a greatly impaired induction (5% of wild-type RNA levels during stress) of His1-3 transcripts in shoots during drought and contain decreased protein relative to wild-type control plants. In plants overexpressing His1-3, more H1-3 is bound to chromatin than in unstressed wild-type plants. None of the plants containing these transgenes display phenotypic aberrations or differences in water content during drought stress. Additionally, the expression of several drought-responsive genes is not significantly altered in lines misexpressing His1-3.
10982332	Promoter-specific targeting of human SWI-SNF complex by Epstein-Barr virus nuclear protein 2.	The multiprotein human SWI-SNF (hSWI-SNF) complex is a chromatin-remodeling machine that facilitates transcription by overcoming chromatin-mediated gene repression. We had previously shown that hSNF5/INI1, an intrinsic, consistent component of the hSWI/SNF complex, is associated with Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) and have proposed that EBNA2 directs this complex to key EBNA2-responsive viral and cellular genes. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR, we show that antibodies directed against components of the hSWI-SNF complex preferentially precipitate chromatin-associated DNA that contains a targeted EBNA2-responsive element in the context of both episomal and cellular chromatin. This enrichment does not occur in EBNA2-negative cells or when the EBNA2-responsive element is mutated. The stable association of the hSWI-SNF complex with the EBNA2-responsive promoter can also be disrupted by deletion of the TATA element, suggesting that EBNA2 in itself is insufficient to mediate stable targeting of the hSWI-SNF complex. These results demonstrate that recruitment of the hSWI-SNF complex to selected promoters can occur in vivo through its interaction with site-specific activator proteins and that stable targeting may require the presence of basal transcription factors.
11473119	Recruitment of multiple interferon regulatory factors and histone acetyltransferase to the transcriptionally active interferon a promoters.	Type I interferon (IFN) plays a critical role in the innate immunity against viral infection. Expression of IFNA genes in infected cells is cell type-dependent and is regulated at the transcriptional level. The present study is focused on the molecular mechanism underlying the differential expression of human IFNA1 and A2 genes. Two nucleotides, at positions -98 and -81 of IFNA1 and A2 promoter, were pivotal to the differential expression. The DNA pull-down and chromatin precipitation assays have shown that nuclear interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and IRF-7 as well as IRF-1 bind to IFNA1 virus-responsive element (VRE). Interestingly, overexpression of IRF-7 increased the otherwise weak binding of both IRF-3 and IRF-7 to IFNA2 VRE. These data together with the results of two-step chromatin immunoprecipitation strongly suggest that the IRF-3 and IRF-7 bind to IFNA1 promoter as a dimer. Furthermore, binding of IRF-3 and IRF-7 to IFNA VRE is associated with the presence of acetylated histone H3, suggesting that histone acetyltransferase(s) is tethered together with virus-activated IRF-3 and IRF-7 to the IFNA1 promoter. In addition, the constitutively active IRF-3 (5D) and IRF-7 (2D) mutants activate the endogenous IFNA genes in uninfected cells; however, the expression profile of IFNA is not identical to that induced by viral infection.
11689684	Methylation-mediated proviral silencing is associated with MeCP2 recruitment and localized histone H3 deacetylation.	The majority of 5-methylcytosine in mammalian DNA resides in endogenous transposable elements and is associated with the transcriptional silencing of these parasitic elements. Methylation also plays an important role in the silencing of exogenous retroviruses. One of the difficulties inherent in the study of proviral silencing is that the sites in which proviruses randomly integrate influence the probability of de novo methylation and expression. In order to compare methylated and unmethylated proviruses at the same genomic site, we used a recombinase-based targeting approach to introduce an in vitro methylated or unmethylated Moloney murine leukemia-based provirus in MEL cells. The methylated and unmethylated states are maintained in vivo, with the exception of the initially methylated proviral enhancer, which becomes demethylated in vivo. Although the enhancer is unmethylated and remodeled, the methylated provirus is transcriptionally silent. To further analyze the repressed state, histone acetylation status was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses, which revealed that localized histone H3 but not histone H4 hyperacetylation is inversely correlated with proviral methylation density. Since members of the methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) family of proteins recruit histone deacetylase activity, these proteins may play a role in proviral repression. Interestingly, only MBD3 and MeCP2 are expressed in MEL cells. ChIPs with antibodies specific for these proteins revealed that only MeCP2 associates with the provirus in a methylation-dependent manner. Taken together, our results suggest that MeCP2 recruitment to a methylated provirus is sufficient for transcriptional silencing, despite the presence of a remodeled enhancer.
12198550	A chromatin remodelling complex that loads cohesin onto human chromosomes.	Nucleosomal DNA is arranged in a higher-order structure that presents a barrier to most cellular processes involving protein DNA interactions. The cellular machinery involved in sister chromatid cohesion, the cohesin complex, also requires access to the nucleosomal DNA to perform its function in chromosome segregation. The machineries that provide this accessibility are termed chromatin remodelling factors. Here, we report the isolation of a human ISWI (SNF2h)-containing chromatin remodelling complex that encompasses components of the cohesin and NuRD complexes. We show that the hRAD21 subunit of the cohesin complex directly interacts with the ATPase subunit SNF2h. Mapping of hRAD21, SNF2h and Mi2 binding sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments reveals the specific association of these three proteins with human DNA elements containing Alu sequences. We find a correlation between modification of histone tails and association of the SNF2h/cohesin complex with chromatin. Moreover, we show that the association of the cohesin complex with chromatin can be regulated by the state of DNA methylation. Finally, we present evidence pointing to a role for the ATPase activity of SNF2h in the loading of hRAD21 on chromatin.
12527906	Identification of target genes for EWS/ATF-1 chimeric transcription factor.	Chromatin immunoprecipitation is a useful technique to detect in vivo direct interaction between any transcription factor and its binding site on genomic DNA. We applied this skill to identify the direct target gene for EWS/ATF-1 by coupling with a GFP reporter assay. This novel approach isolated 62 of cloned DNA fragments responding upon EWS/ATF-1 expression and 16 of 62 clones included putative ATF-1 binding sites. Further analysis revealed that six of the cloned fragments included possible regulatory regions of ATM, GPP34, ARNT2, NKX6.1, NYD-SP28 and POSH. Most of these clones upregulated reporter activity by overexpression of EWS/ATF-1, suggesting that putative ATF-1 binding sites in these clones are functional elements for ATF-1 in vivo. Consistently, endogenous expression of these genes was upregulated by EWS/ATF-1. Interestingly, the clone containing the promoter region of POSH, which is known to be a strong inducer of apoptosis, repressed reporter activity by overexpression of EWS/ATF-1. Correspondingly, EWS/ATF-1 expression decreased endogenous POSH expression, suggesting that six isolated genes may be involved in direct regulation by EWS/ATF-1. Moreover, induction of POSH brought apoptotic cell death to KAS, the clear cell sarcoma (CCS) cell line, suggesting that repressed expression of POSH in CCS may be relevant to the normal signaling pathway in apoptosis.
12791241	Equine trypsin: purification and development of a radio-immunoassay.	Shock is accompanied by generalised splanchnic hypoperfusion, and splanchnic organs like the pancreas can be damaged, as shown in animal experimental models and in humans, by the presence of high plasma concentrations of trypsin and other pancreatic enzymes. In order to design a radioimmunoassay technique (RIA) for the measurement of equine trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) in biological fluids, trypsin was purified (with purity > or = 96%) from the equine pancreas by extraction in an acid medium, ammonium sulfate precipitations, gel filtration chromatography and, after activation of trypsinogen into trypsin, affinity chromatography. Gel polyacrylamide electrophoresis showed a monomeric enzyme with a molecular weight of 27 kDa. The purified equine trypsin served for the immunisation of rabbits in order to obtain a specific antiserum, and the labelled antigen was prepared by iodination of equine trypsin with 125I. The RIA was based on the binding of the antigen to the antibody followed by the separation of the antigen-antibody complex by immunoprecipitation in the presence of sheep anti-rabbit gammaglobulins and the assay of the radioactivity in the precipitate. The RIA showed good sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy and reproducibility. The reference mean value of TLI in the plasma of healthy horses (n = 20) was 30.01+/-6.84 ng/mL (upper confidence limit 50.52 ng/mL; p < 0.01). Three horses with non strangulating intestinal obstruction without shock showed TLI values within normal limits whereas 5 of 7 horses with strangulation obstruction showed TLI levels above the upper confidence limit. Further studies using the RIA and the enzymatic assay should be performed in order to confirm the role of the pancreas in equine intestinal obstruction.
14647463	Direct association between PU.1 and MeCP2 that recruits mSin3A-HDAC complex for PU.1-mediated transcriptional repression.	PU.1, a member of the Ets family of transcription factors, is implicated in hematopoietic cell differentiation through its interactions with other transcriptional factors and cofactors. To identify a novel protein(s) binding to PU.1, we carried out affinity purification using a column of Glutathione-Sepharose beads bound to GST-PU.1 fusion protein and isolated several individual proteins using murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell extracts. Sequence analysis of these proteins revealed that one was MeCP2 a methyl CpG binding protein. GST-pull-down assay and immunoprecipitation assay showed that PU.1 bound directly to MeCP2 via its Ets domain and MeCP2 bound to PU.1 via either its amino terminal domain or trans-repression domain. MeCP2 repressed transcriptional activity of PU.1 on a reporter construct with trimerized PU.1 binding sites. This downregulation was recovered in the presence of histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA). MeCP2 was integrated in PU.1-mSin3A-HDAC complex but not in PU.1-CBP complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that PU.1 and MeCP2 were collocated at the PU.1 binding site on the reporter construct and the PU.1 binding site of the intervening sequence 2 (IVS2) region in the intron of the beta-globin gene, which has been proposed to regulate expression of the gene, in undifferentiated MEL cells. The complex disappeared from the region during the course of erythroid differentiation of MEL cells. Our results suggest that MeCP2 acts as a corepressor of PU.1 probably due to facilitating complex formation with mSin3A and HDACs.
7503181	Evaluation of the Hybrid Capture human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid detection test.	OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate the sensitivity and accuracy of a new, nonradioactive human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid detection method. STUDY DESIGN: Cervical samples from 520 women were assayed for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid with both the Hybrid Capture test and polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid was detected with Hybrid Capture in 106 (42%) of 254 samples from women with no evidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and 211 (79%) of 266 with cervical intraepithelial lesions or cervical cancer. There was a good correlation between Hybrid Capture and polymerase chain reaction. Hybrid Capture correctly identified 92% of samples found to contain a human papillomavirus type with a high or intermediate oncogenic risk with polymerase chain reaction. Although Hybrid Capture can quantify the amount of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid present in a sample, no correlation was observed between the relative amount of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid detected with Hybrid Capture and the grade of cervical lesion. CONCLUSION: The Hybrid Capture test is a sensitive and accurate method for identifying human papillomavirus types of high and intermediate oncogenic risk in clinical specimens.
7891290	Secondary structure characterization of microparticulate insulin powders.	The secondary structure content of microparticulate insulin powders produced by the supercritical antisolvent (SAS) precipitation technique was investigated via Raman spectroscopy. Precipitate samples were generated at 25 and 35 degrees C processing temperatures. Both precipitate samples gave amide I band spectra that were shifted roughly +10 cm-1 relative to the commercial powder. The corresponding secondary structure estimates had significantly increased beta-sheet contents with concomitant decreases in alpha-helix contents relative to the commercial protein; the sum of beta-turn and random coil content remained essentially unchanged. The magnitude of the perturbation was slightly greater for the 35 degrees C sample. Dissolution of the commercial powder and precipitates in 0.01 M HCl yielded solution structure estimates similar to that of the commercial powder. An analysis of insulin in dimethyl sulfoxide, the suspending solvent in the SAS process, indicated that some, but not all, of the structural change observed for the precipitate samples may be attributed to solvent exposure. These results are suggestive of extensive beta-sheet-mediated intermolecular interactions in precipitate states, consistent with analyses of irreversible protein aggregate/fibril states. Interestingly, unlike irreversible protein aggregates, the insulin powders recover essentially full biological activity on reconstitution.
8306968	The chromatin-associated protein H-NS alters DNA topology in vitro.	H-NS is one of the two most abundant proteins in the bacterial nucleoid and influences the expression of a number of genes. We have studied the interaction of H-NS with DNA; purified H-NS was demonstrated to constrain negative DNA supercoils in vitro. This provides support for the hypothesis that H-NS influences transcription via changes in DNA topology, and is evidence of a structural role for H-NS in bacterial chromatin. The effects of H-NS on topology were only observed at sub-saturating concentrations of the protein. In addition, a preferred binding site on DNA was identified by DNase I footprinting at sub-saturating H-NS concentrations. This site corresponded to a curved sequence element which we previously showed, by in vivo studies, to be a site at which H-NS influences transcription of the proU operon. When present in saturating concentrations, H-NS did not constrain supercoils and bound to DNA in a sequence-independent fashion, covering all DNA molecules from end to end, suggesting that H-NS may form distinct complexes with DNA at different H-NS:DNA ratios. The data presented here provide direct support for the hypothesis that H-NS acts at specific sites to influence DNA topology and, hence, transcription.
9358188	Isolation of nuclei for chromatin analysis in fission yeast.	The methods available for analysis of the chromatin of Schizosaccharomyces pombe are time consuming (>8 h) and/or result in some degradation of the chromatin. Here we report an optimised method for the preparation of spheroplasts and the isolation of nuclei which takes <25 min and is suitable for analysis of chromatin structure by micrococcal nuclease, restriction endonuclease or by immunoprecipitation.
10931841	Direct examination of histone acetylation on Myc target genes using chromatin immunoprecipitation.	Overexpression of c-Myc can lead to altered transcriptional regulation of cellular genes and to neoplastic transformation. Although DNA binding is clearly required, the mechanism by which recruitment of c-Myc to target promoters results in transcriptional activation is highly debated. Much of this controversy comes from the difficulty in clearly defining a true Myc target gene. We have previously determined that cad is a bona fide Myc target gene and thus now use the cad promoter as a model to study Myc function. Others have shown that Myc can interact indirectly with histone acetylases and have suggested that Myc mediates transcriptional activation by causing an increase in the levels of acetylated histones on target promoters. To directly test this model, we employed a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to examine the levels of acetylated histones on the cad promoter. Although Myc was bound to the cad promoter in S phase but not in G(0) phase, we found high levels of acetylated histones on the promoter in both stages. We also examined acetylated histones on the cad promoter before and after differentiation of U937 cells. Although the levels of c-Myc bound to the cad promoter were greatly reduced after differentiation, we saw high levels of acetylated histones on the cad promoter both before and after differentiation. Finally, we found that a 30-fold change in binding of N-Myc to the telomerase promoter did not result in a concomitant change in histone acetylation. Thus, recruitment of a Myc family member to a target promoter does not necessarily influence the amount of acetylated histones at that promoter. Further investigations are in progress to define the role of Myc in transcriptional activation.
11245435	Altered profiles in nuclear matrix proteins associated with DNA in situ during progression of breast cancer cells.	Nuclear matrix proteins (NMPs) show promise as informative biomarkers in following the pathogenesis of breast cancer. The nuclear matrix is a dynamic RNA-protein network involved in the organization and expression of chromatin. Cisplatin, which preferentially cross-links nuclear matrix proteins to DNA in situ, may be used to identify NMPs that organize and/or regulate the processing of DNA. In this study, we analyzed the nuclear matrix proteins from an estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell line panel consisting of MCF-7, MIII, LCC1, and LCC2 cell lines. This cell line panel reflects the stages of malignant progression in breast cancer. Proteins isolated from nuclear matrices and proteins cross-linked to nuclear DNA in situ with cisplatin were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Specific changes in nuclear matrix proteins bound to nuclear DNA were identified. In concordance with estrogen independence and antiestrogen insensitivity, a loss in cisplatin cross-linking of specific NMPs to nuclear DNA was observed. Our results suggest that progression of breast cancer is accompanied by a reorganization of chromosomal domains, which may lead to alterations in gene expression.
11813249	Isolation of transcriptionally active chromatin from human breast cancer cells using Sulfolink coupling gel chromatography.	The process of transcription unfolds the nucleosome. The unfolded nucleosome structure will be maintained as long as the histones are in a highly acetylated state. Typically the cysteine residue at position 110 of histone H3 is buried in the interior of the nucleosome. However, the transcribed unfolded nucleosome has its H3 cysteine exposed, offering a tag to isolate and study transcribed nucleosomes. In this study, we applied Sulfolink Coupling Gel chromatography to isolate unfolded nucleosomes from estrogen dependent human cancer T5 cells. Inhibition of histone deacetylase activity did not enhance the yield of unfolded nucleosomes from these cells. We show that the estrogen receptor and c-myc transcribed DNA sequences are associated with unfolded nucleosomes. In chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIPs) assays, we found that the coding regions of the estrogen receptor and c-myc genes are bound to highly acetylated H3 and H4 in cultured T5 Cells. We conclude that in cultured T5 breast cancer cells H3 and H4 are in highly acetylated states maintaining the unfolded structure of the transcribed nucleosome and facilitating subsequent rounds of elongation.
11821378	Binding of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) to Ku but not to DNA-PKcs.	The nonhomologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) pathway is responsible for repairing a major fraction of double strand DNA breaks in somatic cells of all multicellular eukaryotes. As an indispensable protein in the NHEJ pathway, Ku has been hypothesized to be the first protein to bind at the DNA ends generated at a double strand break being repaired by this pathway. When bound to a DNA end, Ku improves the affinity of another DNA end-binding protein, DNA-PK(cs), to that end. The Ku.DNA-PK(cs) complex is often termed the DNA-PK holoenzyme. It was recently shown that myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (IP(6)) stimulates the joining of complementary DNA ends in a cell free system. Moreover, the binding data suggested that IP(6) bound to DNA-PK(cs) (not to Ku). Here we clearly show that, in fact, IP(6) associates not with DNA-PK(cs), but rather with Ku. Furthermore, the binding of DNA ends and IP(6) to Ku are independent of each other. The possible relationship between inositol phosphate metabolism and DNA repair is discussed in light of these findings.
11884609	CENP-A, -B, and -C chromatin complex that contains the I-type alpha-satellite array constitutes the prekinetochore in HeLa cells.	CENP-A is a component of centromeric chromatin and defines active centromere regions by forming centromere-specific nucleosomes. We have isolated centromeric chromatin containing the CENP-A nucleosome, CENP-B, and CENP-C from HeLa cells using anti-CENP-A and/or anti-CENP-C antibodies and shown that the CENP-A/B/C complex is predominantly formed on alpha-satellite DNA that contains the CENP-B box (alphaI-type array). Mapping of hypersensitive sites for micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion indicated that CENP-A nucleosomes were phased on the alphaI-type array as a result of interactions between CENP-B and CENP-B boxes, implying a repetitive configuration for the CENP-B/CENP-A nucleosome complex. Molecular mass analysis by glycerol gradient sedimentation showed that MNase digestion released a CENP-A/B/C chromatin complex of three to four nucleosomes into the soluble fraction, suggesting that CENP-C is a component of the repetitive CENP-B/CENP-A nucleosome complex. Quantitative analysis by immunodepletion of CENP-A nucleosomes showed that most of the CENP-C and approximately half the CENP-B took part in formation of the CENP-A/B/C chromatin complex. A kinetic study of the solubilization of CENPs showed that MNase digestion first released the CENP-A/B/C chromatin complex into the soluble fraction, and later removed CENP-B and CENP-C from the complex. This result suggests that CENP-A nucleosomes form a complex with CENP-B and CENP-C through interaction with DNA. On the basis of these results, we propose that the CENP-A/B/C chromatin complex is selectively formed on the I-type alpha-satellite array and constitutes the prekinetochore in HeLa cells.
12004059	POZ domain transcription factor, FBI-1, represses transcription of ADH5/FDH by interacting with the zinc finger and interfering with DNA binding activity of Sp1.	The POZ domain is a protein-protein interaction motif that is found in many transcription factors, which are important for development, oncogenesis, apoptosis, and transcription repression. We cloned the POZ domain transcription factor, FBI-1, that recognizes the cis-element (bp -38 to -22) located just upstream of the core Sp1 binding sites (bp -22 to +22) of the ADH5/FDH minimal promoter (bp -38 to +61) in vitro and in vivo, as revealed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The ADH5/FDH minimal promoter is potently repressed by the FBI-1. Glutathione S-transferase fusion protein pull-down showed that the POZ domains of FBI-1, Plzf, and Bcl-6 directly interact with the zinc finger DNA binding domain of Sp1. DNase I footprinting assays showed that the interaction prevents binding of Sp1 to the GC boxes of the ADH5/FDH promoter. Gal4-POZ domain fusions targeted proximal to the GC boxes repress transcription of the Gal4 upstream activator sequence-Sp1-adenovirus major late promoter. Our data suggest that POZ domain represses transcription by interacting with Sp1 zinc fingers and by interfering with the DNA binding activity of Sp1.
12023811	Short-range interactions and size of ligands bound to DNA strongly influence adsorptive phase transition caused by long-range interactions.	Long-range interaction between all the ligands bound to DNA molecule may give rise to adsorption with the character of phase transition of the first kind (D. Y. Lando, V. B. Teif, J. Biomol. Struct & Dynam. 18, 903-911 (2000)). In this case, the binding curve, c(c(o)), is characterized by a sudden change of the relative concentration of bound ligands ((c)) at a critical concentration of free (unbound) ligands, c(o)=c(ocr), from a low c value to a high one where c(o) is molar concentration of free ligands. Such a transition might be caused by some types of DNA condensation or changes in DNA topology. For the study of the conditions necessary for adsorption with the character of phase transition, a calculation procedure based on the method of the free energy minimum is developed. The ligand size and two types of interactions between ligands adsorbed on DNA molecule are taken into consideration: long-range interaction between all the ligands bound to DNA and contact interactions between neighboring ligands. It was found that a) Stronger long-range interaction is required for longer ligands to induce phase transition that is occurred at greater c(ocr) values; b) Pure contact interaction between neighboring ligands can not itself initiate phase transition. However contact cooperativity strongly decreases the threshold value of energy of long-range interaction necessary to give rise to the transition.
12153140	Profiling methyl-CpG specific determinants on transcriptionally silent chromatin.	Transcriptional activity is closely associated with DNA methylation and chromatin remodelling. Evidence is emerging that a family of methylation specific (methyl-CpG binding domain, MBD) proteins have the capacity to bind to methylated sequences and repress transcription. Recent advances in this area reveal that many of the MBD proteins are associated with histone deacetylase (HDAC) dependant repression. The capacity of MBD association to repress transcription would largely be defined by promoter structure and this is best explained by the position and density of DNA methylation. The mechanism of specific targeting of MBD family members to methylated sequences remains largely unknown. In order to understand the mechanistic details of silencing the current challenge is to identify and map these molecular determinants assembled on native chromatin in model systems of human development and disease. Downstream targets such as the methylated Fragile X Mental Retardation gene 1 (FMR1) gene and tumour suppressor genes are likely candidates. In this article, we describe a powerful strategy that involves the immunoprecipitation of in vivo formaldehyde fixed chromatin to identify MBD binding complexes directly isolated from the natural chromosomal environment. We demonstrate the methylated human Multidrug Resistance gene 1 (MDR1) is enriched with transcriptional repressors that belong to the MBD family and this would account for transcriptional silencing.
10075735	The essential role of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC6 nucleotide-binding site in cell growth, DNA synthesis, and Orc1 association.	Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc6 is a protein required for the initiation of DNA replication. The biochemical function of the protein is unknown, but the primary sequence contains motifs characteristic of nucleotide-binding sites. To study the requirement of the nucleotide-binding site for the essential function of Cdc6, we have changed the conserved Lys114 at the nucleotide-binding site to five other amino acid residues. We have used these mutants to investigate in vivo roles of the conserved lysine in the growth rate of transformant cells and the complementation of cdc6 temperature-sensitive mutant cells. Our results suggest that replacement of Lys with Glu (K114E) and Pro (K114P) leads to loss-of-function in supporting cell growth, replacement of the Lys with Gln (K114Q) or Leu (K114L) yields partially functional proteins, and replacement with Arg yields a phenotype equivalent to wild-type, a silent mutation. To investigate what leads to the growth defects derived from the mutations at the nucleotide-binding site, we evaluated its gene functions in DNA replication by the assays of the plasmid stability and chromosomal DNA synthesis. Indeed, the K114P and K114E mutants showed the complete retraction of DNA synthesis. In order to test its effect on the G1/S transition of the cell cycle, we have carried out the temporal and spatial studies of yeast replication complex. To do this, yeast chromatin fractions from synchronized culture were prepared to detect the Mcm5 loading onto the chromatin in the presence of the wild-type Cdc6 or mutant cdc6(K114E) proteins. We found that cdc6(K114E) is defective in the association with chromatin and in the loading of Mcm5 onto chromatin origins. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of nucleotide-binding function, we have demonstrated that the Cdc6 protein associates with Orc1 in vitro and in vivo. Intriguingly, the interaction between Orc1 and Cdc6 is disrupted when the cdc6(K114E) protein is used. Our results suggest that a proper molecular interaction between Orc1 and Cdc6 depends on the functional ATP-binding of Cdc6, which may be a prerequisite step to assemble the operational replicative complex at the G1/S transition.
10579938	In vivo cross-linking and immunoprecipitation for studying dynamic Protein:DNA associations in a chromatin environment.	Chromatin structure plays important roles in regulating many DNA-templated processes, such as transcription, replication, and recombination. Considerable progress has recently been made in the identification of large, multisubunit complexes dedicated to these nuclear processes, all of which occur on nucleosomal templates. Mapping specific genomic loci relative to the position of selectively modified or unique histone variants or nonhistone components provides valuable insights into how these proteins (and their modifications) function in their normal chromatin context. Here we describe a versatile and high-resolution method which involves two basic steps: (1) in vivo formaldehyde cross-linking of intact cells followed by (2) selective immunoprecipitation of protein-DNA complexes with specific antibodies. This method allows for detailed analyses of protein-DNA interactions in a native chromatin environment. Recently, this technique has been successfully employed to map the boundaries of specifically modified (e.g., acetylated) histones along target genes, to define the cell cycle-regulated assembly of origin-dependent replication and centromere-specific complexes with remarkable precision, and to map the in vivo position of reasonably rare transcription factors on cognate DNA sites. Thus, the basic chromatin immunoprecipitation technique is remarkably versatile and has now been used in a wide range of cell types, including budding yeast, fly, and human cells. As such, it seems likely that many more studies, centered around chromatin structure and protein-DNA interactions in its native setting, will benefit from this technique. In this article, a brief review of the history of this powerful approach and a discussion of the basic method are provided. Procedures for protein recovery as well as limitations and extensions of the method are also presented.
10580997	In vitro poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated histones H1a and H1t modulate rat testis chromatin condensation differently.	Rat testis H1 proteins were poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated in vitro. The modifying product, poly(ADP-ribose), was found covalently bound to each histone variant at various extents and exhibited distinct structural features (linear and short, rather than branched and long chains). Interest was focused on the somatic H1a, particularly abundant in the testis, as compared with other tissues, and the testis-specific H1t, which appears only at the pachytene spermatocyte stage of germ cell development. These H1s were modified with poly(ADP-ribose) by means of two in vitro experimental approaches. In the first system, each variant was incubated with purified rat testis poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase in the presence of [(32)P] NAD. In parallel, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated H1s were also prepared following incubation of intact rat testis nuclei with [(32)P] NAD. In both experiments, the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins were purified from the native forms by means of phenyl boronic agarose chromatography. The results from both analyses were in agreement and showed qualitative differences with regard to the poly(ADP-ribose) covalently associated with H1a and H1t. Comparison of the bound polymers clearly indicated that the oligomers associated with H1a were within 10-12 units long, whereas longer chains (</=20 ADP-R units) were linked to H1t. Individual poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated H1s were complexed with homologous H1-depleted oligonucleosomes (0.5-2.5 kbp) in order to measure their ability to condensate chromatin, in comparison with the native ones. Circular dichroism showed that the negative charges of the oligomeric polyanion, although present in limited numbers, highly influenced the DNA-binding properties of the analyzed H1s. In particular, the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated H1a and H1t had opposite effects on the condensation of H1-depleted oligonucleosomes.
10759893	A human homologue of yeast anti-silencing factor has histone chaperone activity.	BACKGROUND: Structural changes in chromatin play essential roles in regulating eukaryotic gene expression. Silencing, potent repression of transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, occurs near telomeres and at the silent mating-type loci, as well as at rDNA loci. This type of repression relates to the condensation of chromatin that occurs in the heterochromatin of multicellular organisms. Anti-silencing is a reaction by which silenced loci are de-repressed. Genetic studies revealed that several factors participate in the anti-silencing reaction. However, actions of factors and molecular mechanisms underlying anti-silencing remain unknown. RESULTS: Here we report the functional activity of a highly evolutionarily conserved human factor termed CIA (CCG1-interacting factor A), whose budding yeast homologue ASF1 has anti-silencing activity. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we isolated histone H3 as an interacting factor of CIA. We also showed that CIA binds to histones H3/H4 in vitro, and that the interacting region of histone H3 is located in the C-terminal helices. Considering the functional role of CIA as a histone-interacting protein, we found that CIA forms a nucleosome-like structure with DNA and histones. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that human CIA, whose yeast homologue ASF1 is an anti-silencing factor, possesses histone chaperone activity. This leads to a better understanding of the relationship between chromatin structural changes and anti-silencing processes.
11238381	In vivo chromatin remodeling by yeast ISWI homologs Isw1p and Isw2p.	Isw1p and Isw2p are budding yeast homologs of the Drosophila ISWI chromatin-remodeling ATPase. Using indirect-end-label and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we show both independent and cooperative Isw1p- and Isw2p-mediated positioning of short nucleosome arrays in gene-regulatory elements at a variety of transcription units in vivo. We present evidence that both yeast ISWI complexes regulate developmental responses to starvation and that for Isw2p, recruitment by different DNA-binding proteins controls meiosis and haploid invasive growth.
11309512	Selective association of the methyl-CpG binding protein MBD2 with the silent p14/p16 locus in human neoplasia.	DNA methylation of tumor suppressor genes is a common feature of human cancer. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene p16/Ink4A is hypermethylated in a wide range of malignant tissues and the p14/ARF gene located 20 kb upstream on chromosome 9p21 is also methylated in carcinomas. p14/ARF (ARF, alternative reading frame) does not inhibit the activities of cyclins or cyclin-dependent kinase complexes; however, the importance of the two gene products in the etiology of cancer resides in their involvement in two major cell cycle regulatory pathways: p53 and the retinoblastoma protein, Rb, respectively. Distinct first exons driven from separate promoters are spliced onto the common exons 2 and 3 and the resulting proteins are translated in different reading frames. Both genes are expressed in normal cells but can be alternatively or coordinately silenced when their CpG islands are hypermethylated. Herein, we examined the presence of methyl-CpG binding proteins associated with aberrantly methylated promoters, the distribution of acetylated histones H3 and H4 by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, and the effect of chemical treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5aza-dC) and trichostatin A on gene induction in colon cell lines by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. We observed that the methyl-CpG binding protein MBD2 is targeted to methylated regulatory regions and excludes the acetylated histones H3 and H4, resulting in a localized inactive chromatin configuration. When methylated, the genes can be induced by 5aza-dC but the combined action of 5aza-dC and trichostatin A results in robust gene expression. Thus, methyl-CpG binding proteins and histone deacetylases appear to cooperate in vivo, with a dominant effect of DNA methylation toward histone acetylation, and repress expression of tumor suppressor genes hypermethylated in cancers.
11313463	Kinetics of p53 binding to promoter sites in vivo.	Downstream target genes of p53 are thought to mediate its tumor-suppressive activity, but it is unknown whether differential transactivation of these genes is regulated at the level of p53 binding to their promoters. To address this issue, p53 binding in vivo to consensus sites in the p21(Waf1), MDM2, and PIG3 promoters was investigated in cells exposed to adriamycin (ADR) or ionizing radiation as well as in an inducible p53 cell line. p53-DNA complexes were cross-linked in vivo by treating the cells with formaldehyde and processed by chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR. This methodology allowed for the analysis of relevant p53-DNA complexes by preventing redistribution of cellular components upon collection of cell extracts. Increased p53 binding to the p21(Waf1), MDM2, and PIG3 promoters occurred within 2 h after p53 activation; however, significant increases in PIG3 transcription did not occur until 15 h after p53 binding. Gel shift analyses indicated that p53 had lower affinity for the consensus binding site in the PIG3 promoters compared to its consensus sites in the p21 and MDM2 genes, which suggests that additional factors may be required to stabilize the interaction of p53 with the PIG3 promoter. Further, acetylated p53 (Lys382) was found in chemically cross-linked complexes at all promoter sites examined after treatment of cells with ADR. In summary, the kinetics of p53 binding in vivo to target gene regulatory regions does not uniformly correlate with target gene mRNA expression for the p53 target genes examined. Our results suggest that target genes with low-affinity p53 binding sites may require additional events and will have delayed kinetics of induction compared to those with high-affinity binding sites.
12127990	Hrp3, a chromodomain helicase/ATPase DNA binding protein, is required for heterochromatin silencing in fission yeast.	Hrp3, a paralog of Hrp1, is a novel member of the CHD1 (chromo-helicase/ATPase-DNA binding 1) protein family of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Although it has been considered that CHD1 proteins are required for chromatin modifications in transcriptional regulations, little is known about their roles in vivo. In this study, we examined the effects of Hrp3 on heterochromatin silencing using several S. pombe reporter strains. The phenotypic analysis revealed that hrp3(+) is not an essential gene for cell viability. However, Hrp3 is required for transcriptional repression at silence loci of mat3. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that Hrp3 directly associates with mat3 chromatin. Thus, our results strongly suggest that Hrp3 is involved in heterochromatin silencing and plays a direct role as a chromatin remodeling factor at mat3 in vivo.
12724208	Chromatin as a tool for the study of genome function in cancer.	"The transition to malignancy requires an extensive reconfiguration of the genome's expression program that does not result entirely from actual changes in primary DNA sequence-i.e., mutation. Epigenetic-meta-DNA-gene expression states result from an assembly over a given locus of a poorly understood nucleoprotein entity that includes histones and other architectural components of chromatin, nonhistone DNA-bound regulators, and additional chromatin-bound polypeptides. This structure is rapidly reestablished in the wake of the DNA replication fork, thus ensuring its persistence in rapidly proliferating cells and thereby yielding an exceptionally stable mode of gene expression. Chromatin is the perfect vehicle for enabling such genome control. During S phase both covalently modified histones and histone-associated regulatory proteins distribute to the newly synthesized daughter chromatids in a form of ""molecular dowry"" inherited from the G(1) state of the genome, and impose a specific mode of function on the underlying DNA. An extensively studied example of chromatin-based epigenetic inheritance connects DNA methylation to the targeting of chromatin remodeling and modification. In a broad sense, however, genome reprogramming in cancer is associated with the remodeling of a multitude of regulatory DNA stretches-e.g., promoters, enhancers, locus control regions (LCRs), insulators, etc.-into a specific chromatin architecture. This architectural entity provides a general molecular signature of the cancer epigenome that complements and significantly expands its DNA methylation-based component."
12887907	Recruitment of the recombinational repair machinery to a DNA double-strand break in yeast.	Repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination requires members of the RAD52 epistasis group. Here we use chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to examine the temporal order of recruitment of Rad51p, Rad52p, Rad54p, Rad55p, and RPA to a single, induced DSB in yeast. Our results suggest a sequential, interdependent assembly of Rad proteins adjacent to the DSB initiated by binding of Rad51p. ChIP time courses from various mutant strains and additional biochemical studies suggest that Rad52p, Rad55p, and Rad54p each help promote the formation and/or stabilization of the Rad51p nucleoprotein filament. We also find that all four Rad proteins associate with homologous donor sequences during strand invasion. These studies provide a near comprehensive view of the molecular events required for the in vivo assembly of a functional Rad51p presynaptic filament.
12897158	Occupancy and function of the -150 sterol regulatory element and -65 E-box in nutritional regulation of the fatty acid synthase gene in living animals.	Upstream regulatory factor (USF) and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) play key roles in the transcriptional regulation of the fatty acid synthase (FAS) gene by feeding and insulin. Due to the dual binding specificity of SREBP, as well as the presence of multiple consensus sites for these transcription factors in the FAS promoter, their physiologically relevant functional binding sites have been controversial. Here, in order to determine the occupancy of the putative USF and SREBP binding sites, we examined their protein-DNA interactions in living animals by using formaldehyde cross-linking and immunoprecipitation of chromatin and tested the function of these elements by employing mice transgenic for a reporter gene driven by various 5' deletions as well as site-specific mutations of the FAS promoter. We show that the -332 and -65 E-boxes are bound by USF in both fasted and refed mice, while the -150 SRE is bound by SREBP-1 only in refed mice. We also found that mutation of either the -150 SRE or the -65 E-box abolishes the feeding-induced activation of the FAS promoter in transgenic mice. Furthermore, in vivo occupancy of the FAS promoter by SREBP in the fed state can be prevented by mutation not only of the -150 SRE but, unexpectedly, of the -65 E-box as well. We conclude that the FAS promoter is activated during refeeding via the induced binding of SREBP to the -150 SRE and that USF binding to the -65 E-box is also required for SREBP binding and activation of the FAS promoter.
13678919	Frequency and clinical significance of ischemic preconditioning during percutaneous coronary intervention.	OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine the short- and long-term clinical consequences of ischemic preconditioning (IP) during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND: Ischemic preconditioning has been demonstrated in animal models to significantly diminish the extent of myocardial necrosis consequent to coronary occlusion. Surrogate markers of ischemic injury (ST segment shift, lactate release, creatine kinase release) in humans have been shown to be similarly diminished with IP elicited during PCI. There are no studies of the frequency of inducibility of IP during PCI, nor are there longer-term data on the clinical relevance of IP. METHODS: A total of 382 patients underwent elective PCI employing a previously validated protocol to elicit IP. Procedural, in-hospital, and one-year outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Ischemic preconditioning was elicited in 80% of patients and was associated with a significant reduction in the likelihood of in-hospital adverse cardiac events (IP group, 12.1%; non-IP group, 44.1%; p < 0.0001). Women and diabetic patients were less likely to exhibit IP. By one year, patients failing to manifest IP were at significantly greater risk of post-discharge death or non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) (non-IP group, 25.9%; IP group, 11.1%; p < 0.002). Failure to manifest IP was significantly and independently associated with an increased risk of death or non-fatal MI by one year. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically relevant short- and long-term cardioprotection can be found in association with IP during PCI. In-hospital adverse ischemic events are significantly diminished in patients with IP, as are the risks of death or non-fatal MI at one year. Failure to elicit IP during PCI serves as an independent marker of increased risk of future ischemic events.
8250225	Isolation and characterization of the outer membrane proteins of Serratia marcescens W225.	The study addressed the general problem of fractionating cell envelopes in order to isolate the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria. Whereas the cells are normally transformed into spheroplasts prior to disintegration and membrane separation, Serratia marcescens was found to be resistant to spheroplast formation using the procedures available, which were originally developed for Escherichia coli. An efficient technique for spheroplasting S. marcescens was therefore developed; this comprised combining osmotic shock and lysozyme-EDTA treatment of sucrose-conditioned cells. Spheroplasting efficiency and the amount of outer membrane protein recovered were highly dependent on the spheroplasting technique used. Separation of the outer and inner membranes was performed by two methods, isopyenic centrifugation and selective detergent solubilization with Sarkosyl. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and the analysis of specific inner membrane marker enzymes revealed that the protein obtained by detergent solubilization was much purer than that obtained by isopycnic centrifugation. The outer membrane isolated accounted for 60% of the envelope proteins and had a buoyant density of 1.2502 g/cm3. The protein profile of the outer membrane determined by SDS-PAGE resolved into 12 distinct protein bands, 3 of which represented major proteins.
8520086	Dissolution of phenytoin precipitate with sodium bicarbonate in an occluded central venous access device.	OBJECTIVE: To report a case of restored patency of a central venous access device occluded by precipitate of phenytoin sodium injection. CASE SUMMARY: A patient experienced total occlusion of an implanted subcutaneous port caused by precipitation of phenytoin. Phenytoin sodium injection was mixed inadvertently with dextrose 5% in NaCl 0.45% injection during intravenous administration. Dextrose 5% in NaCl 0.45% injection, which is acidic (pH 4.0), caused the phenytoin sodium injection, a basic solution (pH 12.0), to precipitate. Local instillation of sodium bicarbonate 8.4% injection to decrease the pH of the medium restored patency of the occluded port. DISCUSSION: There are reports of local instillation of solvent restoring central ports occluded by lipid-containing parenteral nutrient admixture, calcium phosphate salt precipitate, and coagulated blood. No report of local instillation into an occluded port to dissolve precipitate of phenytoin could be found. Several factors are involved in the precipitation and dissolution of phenytoin. The key factor in this case was the hydrogen ion concentration (pH) of the solution. Decreased pH caused the precipitation, but increased pH caused the dissolution of the precipitate of phenytoin. CONCLUSIONS: Sodium bicarbonate injection was a suitable agent for clearing precipitate of phenytoin in this case of an occluded implanted central venous access device.
8524231	Modular structure of chromosomal proteins HMG-14 and HMG-17: definition of a transcriptional enhancement domain distinct from the nucleosomal binding domain.	Chromosomal proteins HMG-14 and HMG-17 are the only known nuclear proteins which specifically bind to the nucleosome core particle and are implicated in the generation and/or maintenance of structural features specific to active chromatin. The two proteins facilitate polymerase II and III transcription from in vitro- and in vivo-assembled circular chromatin templates. Here we used deletion mutants and specific peptides to identify the transcriptional enhancement domain and delineate the nucleosomal binding domain of the HMG-14 and -17 proteins. Deletion of the 22 C-terminal amino acids of HMG-17 or 26 C-terminal amino acids of HMG-14 reduces significantly the ability of the proteins to enhance transcription from chromatin templates. In contrast, N-terminal truncation mutants had the same transcriptional enhancement activity as the full-length proteins. We conclude that the negatively charged C-terminal region of the proteins is required for transcriptional enhancement. Chromatin transcription enhancement assays, which involve binding competition between the full-length proteins and peptides derived from their nucleosomal binding regions, indicate that the minimal nucleosomal binding domain of human HMG-17 is 24 amino acids long and spans residues 17 to 40. The results suggest that HMG-14 and -17 proteins have a modular structure and contain distinct functional domains.
8588455	Evidence for the direct involvement of lamins in the assembly of a replication competent nucleus.	Monoclonal antibodies linked to paramagnetic immunobeads (Dynabeads) have been used to investigate the distribution of lamin B3 in fractions of Xenopus egg extracts. Lamin B3 behaved as if it were completely soluble and did not co-precipitate with membrane fractions. Sperm pronuclei assembled in lamin depleted egg extracts were compared to pronuclei assembled in mock depleted extracts by field emission in-lens electron scanning microscopy (FEISEM). This technique revealed that the surface structures of the nuclear envelopes, including nuclear pores, appeared to be identical, indicating that lamin depletion does not affect nuclear envelope assembly. One-dimensional and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to analyze soluble proteins co-precipitated with lamin B3 on Dynabeads. Our results indicate that two major species (molecular mass: 105 kDa and 57 kDa) specifically co-precipitate with lamin B3 as well as several minor species. At least three proteins which co-precipitate with lamin B3 were identified as nuclear matrix proteins. Lamin B3 was separated from these proteins and re-inoculated into lamin depleted extracts. This resulted in partial rescue of both lamina assembly and DNA replication. These results imply that lamin B3 is directly involved in the assembly of structures required for the initiation of DNA replication.
8599938	Evidence for a shared structural role for HMG1 and linker histones B4 and H1 in organizing chromatin.	The high mobility group proteins 1 and 2 (HMG1/2) and histone B4 are major components of chromatin within the nuclei assembled during the incubation of Xenopus sperm chromatin in Xenopus egg extract. To investigate their potential structural and functional roles, we have cloned and expressed Xenopus HMG1 and histone B4. Purified histone B4 and HMG1 form stable complexes with nucleosomes including Xenopus 5S DNA. Both proteins associate with linker DNA and stabilize it against digestion with micrococcal nuclease, in a similar manner to histone H1. However, neither histone B4 nor HMG1 influence the DNase I or hydroxyl radical digestion of DNA within the nucleosome core. We suggest that HMG1/2 and histone B4 have a shared structural role in organizing linker DNA in the nucleosome.
8858134	Rapid identification of homeodomain binding sites in the Wnt-5a gene using an immunoprecipitation strategy.	Here we describe an immunoprecipitation approach for identifying homeodomain binding sites within uncharacterized genomic sequences of a putative downstream target gene, Wnt-5a. Immunoprecipitation of Wnt-5a genomic fragments was performed using a purified Msx1 homeodomain polypeptide (Msx1) and its corresponding antisera (alpha-Msx1). This resulted in isolation of three fragments containing multiple DNA binding sites for Msx1, as confirmed by DNA binding studies. The three fragments were contiguous within a 3.4 kb intronic sequence of Wnt-5a. Moreover, at least one of the Msx1 sites has been conserved throughout evolution, suggesting that these sites may comprise or contribute to a regulatory element for Wnt-5a. We propose that the immunoprecipitation strategy permits a rapid, initial approach for identifying functionally-relevant homeodomain binding sites within target genes whose regulatory sequences have not yet been previously elucidated.
8939603	The Xenopus origin recognition complex is essential for DNA replication and MCM binding to chromatin.	BACKGROUND: The origin recognition complex (ORC) and the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) protein complex were initially discovered in yeast and shown to be essential for DNA replication. Homologues of ORC and MCM proteins exist in higher eukaryotes, including Xenopus. The Xenopus MCM proteins and the Xenopus homologues of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Orc 1p and Orc2p (XOrc1 and XOrc2) have recently been shown to be essential for DNA replication. Here, we describe the different but interdependent functions of the ORC and MCM complexes in DNA replication in Xenopus egg extracts. RESULTS: The XOrc1 and XOrc2 proteins are present in the same multiprotein complex in Xenopus egg extracts. Immunodepletion of ORC inhibits DNA replication of Xenopus sperm nuclei. Mixing MCM-depleted and ORC-depleted extracts restores replication capacity. ORC does not co-localize with sites of DNA replication during elongation. However, at initiation the two staining patterns overlap. In contrast to MCMs, which are displaced from chromatin during S phase, XOrc1 and XOrc2 are nuclear chromatin-bound proteins throughout interphase and move to the cytoplasm in mitosis. Permeable HeLa G1- and G2-phase nuclei can replicate in ORC-depleted extract, consistent with the presence of chromatin-bound ORC in both pre-replicative and post-replicative nuclei. Interestingly, the binding of ORC to chromatin does not require the presence of MCMs; however, the binding of MCM proteins to chromatin is dependent on the presence of ORC. CONCLUSIONS: The Xenopus ORC and the MCM protein complex perform essential, non-redundant functions in DNA replication. Xenopus ORC is bound to chromatin throughout interphase but, in contrast to S. cerevisiae ORC, it appears to be, at least partly, displaced from chromatin during mitosis. The binding of MCM proteins requires the presence of ORC. Thus, the assembly of replication-competent chromatin involves the sequential binding of ORC and MCMs to DNA.
9169194	Chromosomal mapping of core histone acetylation by immunoselection.	Acetylation of specific lysine residues in the N-terminal domains of core histones is a biochemical marker of active genes. To determine the spatial and temporal distribution of this reversible posttranslational modification, affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies recognizing the epitope epsilon-acetyllysine have been used in immunoselection procedures with mononucleosomes and salt-soluble chromatin fragments generated by micrococcal nuclease. The DNA of the antibody-selected chromatin was slot-blotted and probed with a variety of gene sequences: an enhanced hybridization signal, with respect to that from the DNA of the input chromatin, demonstrated elevated acetylation levels on the histones associated with the probing sequences. Using chicken embryonic erythrocytes as chromatin source and probes from the beta globin locus, it was shown that both the embryonic epsilon and adult beta genes are acetylated at 5 and 15 days, and the acetylation uniformly covers the whole of the locus, precisely comapping with the 33 kb of open chromatin structure. Studies with proliferating human K562 cells show that the inactive but poised PDGF-beta gene is already hyperacetylated and that its acetylation status is not enhanced on induction. These results indicate that acetylation is not a consequence of transcription but a prerequisite and that it may be responsible for either generating or maintaining the open structure of poised and active genes.
9740716	Chromatin structure and analysis of mechanisms of activators and repressors.	Some transcriptional repressors appear to organize chromatin structure as at least part of their mechanism. Some transcriptional activators appear to alter or remodel chromatin structure as at least part of their mechanism. Understanding transcriptional regulation thus requires methods for investigation of the chromatin structure of specific genes in different states of functional activity. This paper reviews chemical and enzymatic approaches to determination of chromatin structure, the methods used for analysis of the results, and criteria for interpretation of the data to infer chromatin structures.
10841543	Nutrient regulation of gene expression by the sterol regulatory element binding proteins: increased recruitment of gene-specific coregulatory factors and selective hyperacetylation of histone H3 in vivo.	We have evaluated the mechanism for sterol-regulated gene expression by the sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) in intact cells. We show that activation of SREBPs by sterol depletion results in the increased binding of Sp1 to a site adjacent to SREBP in the promoter for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene in vivo. Similarly, sterol depletion resulted in the increased recruitment of two distinct SREBP coregulatory factors, NF-Y and CREB, to the promoter for hydroxymethyl glutaryl CoA reductase, another key gene of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis. Furthermore, increased acetylation of histone H3 but not H4 was also detected in chromatin from both promoters on SREBP activation. Thus, SREBP activation results in the similar selective recruitment of different coregulatory generic transcription factors to two separate cholesterol-regulated promoters. These studies demonstrate the utility of the chromatin immunoprecipitation technique for analyzing the differential action of low-abundance transcription factors in fundamental regulatory events in intact cells. Our results also provide key in vivo support for the mechanism proposed from cell-free experiments, where SREBP increased the binding of Sp1 to the LDL receptor promoter. Finally, our findings also indicate that subtle differences in the pattern of core histone acetylation play a role in selective gene activation.
11230169	A novel chromatin immunoprecipitation and array (CIA) analysis identifies a 460-kb CENP-A-binding neocentromere DNA.	Centromere protein A (CENP-A) is an essential histone H3-related protein that constitutes the specialized chromatin of an active centromere. It has been suggested that this protein plays a key role in the epigenetic marking and transformation of noncentromeric genomic DNA into functional neocentromeres. Neocentromeres have been identified on more than two-thirds of the human chromosomes, presumably involving different noncentromeric DNA sequences, but it is unclear whether some generalized sequence properties account for these neocentromeric sites. Using a novel method combining chromatin immunoprecipitation and genomic array hybridization, we have identified a 460-kb CENP-A-binding DNA domain of a neocentromere derived from the 20p12 region of an invdup (20p) human marker chromosome. Detailed sequence analysis indicates that this domain contains no centromeric alpha-satellite, classical satellites, or other known pericentric repetitive sequence motifs. Putative gene loci are detected, suggesting that their presence does not preclude neocentromere formation. The sequence is not significantly different from surrounding non-CENP-A-binding DNA in terms of the prevalence of various interspersed repeats and binding sites for DNA-interacting proteins (Topoisomerase II and High-Mobility-Group protein I). Notable variations include a higher AT content similar to that seen in human alpha-satellite DNA and a reduced prevalence of long terminal repeats (LTRs), short interspersed repeats (SINEs), and Alus. The significance of these features in neocentromerization is discussed.
11676976	Reactivity of macroprolactin in common automated immunoassays.	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate a simple assay for macroprolactin for use with the Bayer Immuno 1 analyzer, and to compare the reactivity of macroprolactin in commonly used automated prolactin assays. METHODS: Macroprolactin in serum was precipitated in a buffer containing 13.3% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, redissolved, and assayed on the Bayer Immuno 1 for PRL. Presence of macroprolactin was confirmed in some sera by FPLC using a Pharmacia Superose 12 column, followed by prolactin assay of the fractions on the Immuno 1. Sera with and without macroprolactin were then also assayed on the Abbott AxSYM, Bayer Centaur, Beckman Access, and Roche Elecsys. RESULTS: The PEG precipitation assay is simple and reproducible (CVs < 15%), and we established a normal range of < 20% precipitation of total PRL by PEG. The assay correlates well with the amount of macroprolactin separated by FPLC as a peak with a MW of approximately 180 kDa. Macroprolactin showed the following cross-reactivities in commonly used PRL assays: Roche Elecsys > Bayer Immuno 1 > Abbott AxSYM > Bayer Centaur > Beckman Access, with the Centaur showing more variability than other assays. CONCLUSION: Macroprolactin can be easily quantitated using the Immuno 1 PRL assay after PEG precipitation. It cross-reacts to different degrees with common prolactin assays, and is a major source of variability between them.
11713309	Altered chromatin structure associated with methylation-induced gene silencing in cancer cells: correlation of accessibility, methylation, MeCP2 binding and acetylation.	Silencing of tumor-suppressor genes by hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands is well documented in human cancer and may be mediated by methyl-CpG-binding proteins, like MeCP2, that are associated in vivo with chromatin modifiers and transcriptional repressors. However, the exact dynamic between methylation and chromatin structure in the regulation of gene expression is not well understood. In this study, we have analyzed the methylation status and chromatin structure of three CpG islands in the p14(ARF)/p16(INK4A) locus in a series of normal and cancer cell lines using methylation-sensitive digestion, MspI accessibility in intact nuclei and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. We demonstrate the existence of an altered chromatin structure associated with the silencing of tumor-suppressor genes in human cancer cell lines involving CpG island methylation, chromatin condensation, histone deacetylation and MeCP2 binding. The data showed that MeCP2 could bind to methylated CpG islands in both promoters and exons; MeCP2 does not interfere with transcription when bound at an exon, suggesting a more generalized role for the protein beyond transcriptional repression. In the absence of methylation, it is demonstrated that CpG islands located in promoters versus exons display marked differences in the levels of acetylation of associated histone H3, suggesting that chromatin remodeling can be achieved by methylation-independent processes and perhaps explaining why non-promoter CpG islands are more susceptible to de novo methylation than promoter islands.
12032298	A core-BRAF35 complex containing histone deacetylase mediates repression of neuronal-specific genes.	BRAF35, a structural DNA-binding protein, initially was identified as a component of a large BRCA2-containing complex. Biochemical analysis revealed the presence of a smaller core-BRAF35 complex devoid of BRCA2. Here we report the isolation of a six-subunit core-BRAF35 complex with the capacity to deacetylate histones, termed the BRAF-histone deacetylase complex (BHC), from human cells. BHC contains polypeptides reminiscent of the chromatin-remodeling complexes SWI/SNF and NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and deacetylating). Similar to NuRD, BHC contains an Mi2-like subunit, BHC80, and a PHD zinc-finger subunit as well as histone deacetylases 1/2 and an MTA-like subunit, the transcriptional corepressor CoREST. We show that BHC mediates repression of neuron-specific genes through the cis-regulatory element known as the repressor element 1 or neural restrictive silencer (RE1/NRS). Chromatin-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate the recruitment of BHC by the neuronal repressor REST. Expression of BRAF35 containing a single point mutation in the HMG domain of the protein abrogated REST-mediated transcriptional repression. These results demonstrate a role for core-BRAF35-containing complex in the regulation of neuron-specific genes through modulation of the chromatin structure.
12629508	Identification of novel pRb binding sites using CpG microarrays suggests that E2F recruits pRb to specific genomic sites during S phase.	The retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein is an important regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation. Many studies have shown that pRb can negatively regulate the activity of the E2F family of transcription factors during G(0) and G(1) phases of the cell cycle, perhaps by serving as a bridge between the E2Fs and transcriptional repressors such as histone deacetylases and methylases. However, pRb has also been shown to localize to discrete DNA foci during S phase, a time at which pRb is thought to be dissociated from E2F. Numerous other DNA binding proteins have been shown to interact with pRb, suggesting that pRb may control progression through S phase by binding to sites in the genome distinct from E2F target gene promoters. To test this hypothesis, we have identified novel pRb binding sites within the human genome using an unbiased approach which relies upon a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and CpG microarray analysis. To provide the greatest opportunity of finding distinct sets of pRb binding sites, we examined pRb binding in chromatin obtained from human Raji cells synchronized in either G(0)/G(1) phase or S phase. These experiments have allowed us to identify a large set of new genomic binding sites for the pRb protein. We found that some sites are occupied by pRb only during G(0)/G(1) phase, as would be predicted from previous models of pRb function. We also identified sites to which pRb bound only during S phase and other sites which were bound constitutively by pRb. Surprisingly, we found that E2F1 was present at most of the CpG islands bound by pRb, independent of the phase of the cell cycle. Thus, although pRb has the potential to interact with numerous transcription factors, our data suggest that the majority of DNA-bound pRb is recruited to E2F target promoters during both G(0)/G(1) and S phases.
9099751	In vivo interaction of human MCM heterohexameric complexes with chromatin. Possible involvement of ATP.	The MCM protein family, which consists of at least six members, has been implicated in the regulatory machinery causing DNA to replicate once in the S phase. Mammalian MCM proteins are present in the nucleus in two different forms, one extractable by nonionic detergents and the other resistant to such extraction. The latter is assumed to be tightly associated with nuclear structures and released at the time of initiation of replication. However, details of the mode of binding remain unclear. In the present study, we found that, in nonionic detergent-permeabilized nuclei, the association of human MCM (hMCM) proteins with them could be stabilized by the addition of ATP. The hMCMs bound to the nuclei in the presence of ATP were released by digestion with nucleases, suggesting that they are chromatin-associated. The nuclease-directed solubilization of the chromatin-bound hMCMs thus provided a means to analyze them as well as soluble hMCMs by co-immunoprecipitation. The results indicate that the six hMCM members exist as heterocomplexes, whether bound or unbound. We therefore propose that hMCM proteins may function in DNA replication as heterohexamers associated with chromatin and that ATP is possibly involved in the association. Nuclease digestion-immunoprecipitation techniques of the type described here should facilitate further elucidation of the mode of interaction between hMCMs and chromatin.
10465765	Spermine-induced aggregation of DNA, nucleosome, and chromatin.	"We have analyzed the conditions of aggregation or precipitation of DNA in four different states: double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), mononucleosome core particles (NCP), and H1-depleted chromatin fragments (ChF) in the presence of the multivalent cation spermine (4+). In an intermediate regime of DNA concentration, these conditions are identical for the four states. This result demonstrates that the mechanism involved is general from flexible chains to rigid rods and quasi-colloidal states. It is dominated by local electrostatic attractions that are considered, for instance, by the ""ion-bridging"" model. The onset of precipitation does not require the electroneutrality of the DNA chains. Above a given spermine concentration dsDNA aggregates remain neutral, whereas NCP aggregates turn positively charged. The difference is thought to originate from the extension of the positively charged proteic tails of the NCP. This suggests that local fluctuations of polyamine concentrations can induce either positively or negatively charged chromatin domains."
10499801	Identification of cohesin association sites at centromeres and along chromosome arms.	"A multisubunit cohesin complex holds sister chromatids together after DNA replication. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we detected cohesin association with centromeres and with discrete sites along chromosome arms from S phase until metaphase in S. cerevisiae. Short DNA sequences (130-280 bp) are sufficient to confer cohesin association. Cohesin association with a centromere depends on Mif2p, the centromere binding factor CBF3, and a centromere-specific histone variant, Cse4p. Because only active centromeres confer cohesin association with centromeric DNA, we suggest that cohesin is recruited by the same chromatin structure that confers the attachment of microtubules. Propagation of this structure might be partly epigenetic. Finally, cohesion associated with ""minimal"" centromeres is insufficient to resist the splitting force exerted by microtubules and appears to be reinforced by cohesion provided by their flanking DNA sequences."
11278346	Nickel resistance and chromatin condensation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing a maize high mobility group I/Y protein.	Expression of a maize cDNA encoding a high mobility group (HMG) I/Y protein enables growth of transformed yeast on a medium containing toxic nickel concentrations. No difference in the nickel content was measured between yeast cells expressing either the empty vector or the ZmHMG I/Y2 cDNA. The ZmHMG I/Y2 protein contains four AT hook motifs known to be involved in binding to the minor groove of AT-rich DNA regions. HMG I/Y proteins may act as architectural elements modifying chromatin structure. Indeed, a ZmHMG I/Y2-green fluorescent protein fusion protein was observed in yeast nuclei. Nickel toxicity has been suggested to occur through an epigenetic mechanism related to chromatin condensation and DNA methylation, leading to the silencing of neighboring genes. Therefore, the ZmHMG I/Y2 protein could prevent nickel toxicity by interfering with chromatin structure. Yeast cell growth in the presence of nickel and yeast cells expressing the ZmHMG I/Y2 cDNA increased telomeric URA3 gene silencing. Furthermore, ZmHMG I/Y2 restored a wild-type level of nickel sensitivity to the yeast (Delta)rpd3 mutant. Therefore, nickel resistance of yeast cells expressing the ZmHMG I/Y2 cDNA is likely achieved by chromatin structure modification, restricting nickel accessibility to DNA.
11682627	A unique downstream estrogen responsive unit mediates estrogen induction of proteinase inhibitor-9, a cellular inhibitor of IL-1beta- converting enzyme (caspase 1).	Recently, proteinase inhibitor 9 (PI-9) was identified as the first endogenous inhibitor of caspase 1 (IL-1beta-converting enzyme). The regulation of PI-9 expression, therefore, has great importance in the control of inflammatory processes. We reported that PI-9 mRNA and protein are rapidly and directly induced by estrogen in human liver cells. Using transient transfections to assay PI-9 promoter truncations and mutations, we demonstrate that this strong estrogen induction is mediated by a unique downstream estrogen responsive unit (ERU) approximately 200 nucleotides downstream of the transcription start site. Using primers flanking the ERU in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrate estrogen-dependent binding of ER to the cellular PI-9 promoter. The ERU consists of an imperfect estrogen response element (ERE) palindrome immediately adjacent to a direct repeat containing two consensus ERE half-sites separated by 13 nucleotides (DR13). In transient transfections, all four of the ERE half-sites in the imperfect ERE and in the DR13 were important for estrogen inducibility. Transfected chicken ovalbumin upstream transcription factor I and II down-regulated estrogen-mediated expression from the ERU. EMSAs using purified recombinant human ERalpha demonstrate high-affinity binding of two ER complexes to the ERU. Further EMSAs showed that one ER dimer binds to an isolated DR13, supporting the view that one ER dimer binds to the imperfect ERE and one ER dimer binds to DR13. Deoxyribonuclease I footprinting showed that purified ER protected all four of the half-sites in the ERU. Our finding that a direct repeat can function with an imperfect ERE palindrome to confer estrogen inducibility on a native gene extends the repertoire of DNA sequences able to function as EREs.
12004060	The origin recognition complex marks a replication origin in the human TOP1 gene promoter.	The locations of the origin recognition complex (ORC) in mammalian genomes have been elusive. We have therefore analyzed the DNA sequences associated with human ORC via in vivo cross-linking and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Antibodies specific for hOrc2 protein precipitate chromatin fragments that also contain other ORC proteins, suggesting that the proteins form multisubunit complexes on chromatin in vivo. A binding region for ORC was identified at the CpG island upstream of the human TOP1 gene. Nascent strand abundance assays show that the ORC binding region coincides with an origin of bidirectional replication. The TOP1 gene includes two well characterized matrix attachment regions. The matrix attachment region elements analyzed contain no ORC and constitute no sites for replication initiation. In initial attempts to use the chromatin immunoprecipitation technique for the identification of additional ORC sites in the human genome, we isolated a sequence close to another actively transcribed gene (TOM1) and an alphoid satellite sequence that underlies centromeric heterochromatin. Nascent strand abundance assays gave no indication that the heterochromatin sequence serves as a replication initiation site, suggesting that an ORC on this site may perform functions other than replication initiation.
12054903	Identification of unknown target genes of human transcription factors using chromatin immunoprecipitation.	The standard chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay is used to examine the specific association of transcription factors with DNA in the context of living cells. Here we review two modifications to this protocol which are designed to identify novel target genes of transcription factors in mammalian cells. The main advantage to both of these approaches is that only DNA sequences directly bound by a factor within the context of a living cell will be identified. Therefore, artifacts associated with overexpression and/or alterations in signaling pathways are avoided. The first modification we describe, a ChIP cloning strategy, can be used to isolate any genomic fragment specifically associated with a particular factor. It requires no special equipment or reagents other than a high-affinity antibody to be used for immunoprecipitation of the factor of interest. However, it is most useful for the isolation of a small number of genomic targets. In contrast, the second modification, which combines ChIP with specialized CpG microarrays, is ideal for a more global analysis of target genes. Advantages, common problems, and detailed protocols for these two ChIP techniques are discussed.
12054904	Characterizing transcription factor binding sites using formaldehyde crosslinking and immunoprecipitation.	In their article, A.S. Weinmann and P.J. Farnham (2002, Methods 26) described new techniques for isolating in vivo binding sites for any DNA-binding protein. In this article, we describe complementary methods for detailed in vivo characterizations of such identified protein-DNA interactions. First, we describe how formaldehyde crosslinking and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), in conjunction with transient transfections or the use of cell lines containing stably integrated constructs or episomes, can be employed to identify which specific nucleotides of a region of DNA are required for recruitment of a particular transcription factor. In contrast to in vivo footprinting, this method not only specifies which nucleotides are bound, but also identifies the protein(s) involved in binding. Next, we discuss the use of the ChIP assay to study how binding of a transcription factor is altered by passage through the cell cycle, by overexpression or deletion of another factor, or during tumorigenesis. Finally, a look toward the future suggests that the ChIP assay may be combined with Western blot analysis or mass spectrometry to identify additional proteins that interact with a transcription factor of interest.
12167709	GAGA factor and the TFIID complex collaborate in generating an open chromatin structure at the Drosophila melanogaster hsp26 promoter.	The upstream regulatory region of the Drosophila melanogaster hsp26 gene includes two DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DH sites) that encompass the critical heat shock elements. This chromatin structure is required for heat shock-inducible expression and depends on two (CT)n*(GA)n elements bound by GAGA factor. To determine whether GAGA factor alone is sufficient to drive formation of the DH sites, we have created flies with an hsp26/lacZ transgene wherein the entire DNA segment known to interact with the TFIID complex has been replaced by a random sequence. The replacement results in a loss of heat shock-inducible hsp26 expression and drastically diminishes nuclease accessibility in the chromatin of the regulatory region. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments show that the decrease in TFIID binding does not reduce GAGA factor binding. In contrast, the loss of GAGA factor binding resulting from (CT)n mutations decreases TFIID binding. These data suggest that both GAGA factor and TFIID are necessary for formation of the appropriate chromatin structure at the hsp26 promoter and predict a regulatory mechanism in which GAGA factor binding precedes and contributes to the recruitment of TFIID.
12424244	Telomeric DNA ends are essential for the localization of Ku at telomeres in fission yeast.	The Ku70-Ku80 heterodimer is a conserved protein complex essential for the non-homologous end-joining pathway. Ku proteins are also involved in telomere maintenance, although their precise roles remain to be elucidated. In fission yeast, pku70(+), the gene encoding the Ku70 homologue, has been reported. Here we report the identification and characterization of pku80(+), the gene encoding Ku80. Both pku70(+) and pku80(+) are essential for efficient non-homologous end-joining. We also found that the pku70 and pku80 mutants are sensitive to methyl methanesulfonate and hydroxyurea, suggesting their roles in the S phase. The pku80 mutant shows telomere shortening and tandem amplification of a subtelomeric sequence but no defects in the telomere position effect, as was previously reported for the pku70 mutant. By using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we demonstrated that Pku70 and Pku80 physically interact with telomeric repeats and subtelomeric sequences. Interestingly, this telomere association of Pku proteins is independent of Taz1, a telomeric DNA-binding protein. We also showed that the Pku proteins do not associate with ectopically integrated telomeric repeats in the internal region of circular chromosomes. These results indicate that the physical end of DNA is necessary for the localization of Pku80 at telomeres.
12618455	Additional targets of the Bacillus subtilis global regulator CodY identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation and genome-wide transcript analysis.	Additional targets of CodY, a GTP-activated repressor of early stationary-phase genes in Bacillus subtilis, were identified by combining chromatin immunoprecipitation, DNA microarray hybridization, and gel mobility shift assays. The direct targets of CodY newly identified by this approach included regulatory genes for sporulation, genes that are likely to encode transporters for amino acids and sugars, and the genes for biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids.
7637960	Effects of cycloheximide on chromatin-bound and -unbound PCNA in HeLa cells.	We examined the effects of cycloheximide on the amount of chromatin-bound and -unbound PCNA subpopulations in HeLa cells. The chromatin-bound PCNA content decreased rapidly in the presence of cycloheximide, whereas the reduction of the total amount of PCNA was minimal even 24 h after the treatment with cycloheximide. From these data, the half-life of PCNA was estimated to be 31.0 h for chromatin-bound PCNA and 276.8 h for the total.
7903220	Mapping Polycomb-repressed domains in the bithorax complex using in vivo formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin.	The Polycomb group (Pc-G) proteins are responsible for keeping developmental regulators, like homeotic genes, stably and inheritably repressed during Drosophila development. Several similarities to a protein class involved in heterochromatin formation suggest that the Pc-G exerts its function at the higher order chromatin level. Here we have mapped the distribution of the Pc protein in the homeotic bithorax complex (BX-C) of Drosophila tissue culture cells. We have elaborated a method, based on the in vivo formaldehyde cross-linking technique, that allows a substantial enrichment for Pc-interacting sites by immunoprecipitation of the cross-linked chromatin with anti-Pc antibodies. We find that the Pc protein quantitatively covers large regulatory regions of repressed BX-C genes. Conversely, we find that the Abdominal-B gene is active in these cells and the region devoid of any bound Pc protein.
9882682	NAD-dependent DNA-binding activity of the bifunctional NadR regulator of Salmonella typhimurium.	NadR is a 45-kDa bifunctional regulator protein. In vivo genetic studies indicate that NadR represses three genes involved in the biosynthesis of NAD. It also participates with an integral membrane protein (PnuC) in the import of nicotinamide mononucleotide, an NAD precursor. NadR was overexpressed and purified as a His-tagged fusion in order to study its DNA-binding properties. The protein bound to DNA fragments containing NAD box consensus sequences. NAD proved to be the relevant in vivo corepressor, but full NAD dependence of repressor activity required nucleotide triphosphates. DNA footprint analysis and gel shift assays suggest that NadR binds as a multimer to adjacent NAD boxes. The DNA-repressor complex would sequester a potential RNA polymerase binding site and thereby decrease expression of the nad regulon.
10036140	Precipitation of dilute chromatographic samples (ng/ml) containing interfering substances for SDS-PAGE.	SDS-PAGE of chromatographic fractions requires prior removal of salts, detergents, denaturants, or organic solvents which may perturb the electrophoretic separation. Likewise, to successfully visualize minute amounts of protein present in chromatographic fractions, they must often be concentrated before analysis by SDS-PAGE. In this study, we used a dye precipitation procedure for simultaneous removal of interfering substances and concentration of dilute samples (ng/ml) before analysis by SDS-PAGE. Nanogram amounts of protein (143 ng) were effectively precipitated with a pyrogallol red-molybdate reagent from commonly used chromatographic buffers containing various interfering solutes or solvents. Proteins were successfully precipitated from solution in the presence of organic solvents (acetonitrile, methanol, 2-propanol), chaotropic agents (6 M urea, 6 M guanidine-HCl), a protein stabilizer (40% sucrose), metal chelators (30 mM EDTA and 30 mM EGTA), or high salt (1.0 M NaCl). Detergents, at concentrations up to twice their critical micelle concentrations, from the nonionic class (Triton X-100, Tween 20) or from the zwitterionic class (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) did not inhibit protein precipitation. Some interference was observed when proteins were precipitated in the presence of ammonium sulfate (0. 5-2.0 M). Proteins did not precipitate in the presence of ionic detergents (SDS and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide). The sensitivity of the combined pyrogallol red-molybdate precipitation/SDS-PAGE procedure is approximately 7 ng. Two other methods of precipitating proteins (trichloroacetic acid and phenol-ether) both exhibited varying degrees of effectiveness, ranging from 714 to 7 ng/ml, in the precipitation of individual proteins. In summary, the pyrogallol red-molybdate protein precipitation procedure facilitates the SDS-PAGE analysis of dilute protein samples (ng/ml) from chromatographic fractions of various compositions. The method is useful for rapid pilot-scale protein fractionation and facilitates the ongoing propensity of researchers to work with minuscule amounts of protein.
10515209	Purification and initial characterization of primate satellite chromatin.	Nucleoprotein hybridization, a method for the purification of specific DNA sequences as chromatin, was employed to fractionate primate centromeric alpha satellite chromatin as a first step in the identification and analysis of novel centromere-enriched proteins. In order to optimize the amount of material available for further study, cultured African green monkey cells were employed because satellite DNA represents approximately 25% of the genome. Two chromatin preparations were compared for the yield and total protein content of purified material. Regardless of the preparation, alpha satellite sequences were enriched to near purity. Since intact satellite chromatin is relatively refractile to the enzymatic digestion steps in the method, the total amount of solubilized material available for purification is rather low. In contrast, nuclei treated with acidic washes to extract histone H1 provided solubilized material enriched in satellite sequences. In addition, this material is more efficiently utilized in an affinity chromatography step. However, the extraction of many non-histones at low pH resulted in very low yields of protein in the purified fraction. Two-dimensional gel comparisons of proteins associated with H1-containing satellite chromatin after iodination of total chromatin proteins revealed a number of polypeptides enriched to varying degrees in the purified fraction. The electrophoretic mobilities of a few enriched polypeptides corresponded to previously identified heterochromatin-associated proteins while many others appear to be novel. The work presented validates nucleoprotein hybridization as a purification method for highly repeated sequences as chromatin in analytical amounts. The fact that a number of the enriched proteins are visible in stained gels of bulk chromatin proteins suggests that further biochemical analysis can be carried out on these polypeptides directly.
10707833	The role of adenylate cyclase in ischemic preconditioning in the rat heart: a cytochemical study.	Using catalytic cytochemistry the AC activity was studied during ischemic preconditioning (IP) (5 min occlusion of LAD and 10 min reperfusion) followed by 30 min regional ischemia in isolated Langendorff-perfused rat heart. In controls the specific precipitate of AC reaction was found on the sarcolemma (SL) and the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (JSR) of cardiomyocytes. After prolonged ischemia the reaction product was absent, whereas IP followed by prolonged ischemia protected the AC activity on SL and JSR. IP-induced enhancement of AC activity in this model was accompanied by significant reduction of ischemia/reperfusion fibrillation. The results suggest involvement of AC system in mechanisms of IP.
11564866	Use of chromatin immunoprecipitation to clone novel E2F target promoters.	We have taken a new approach to the identification of E2F-regulated promoters. After modification of a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we cloned nine chromatin fragments which represent both strong and weak in vivo E2F binding sites. Further characterization of three of the cloned fragments revealed that they are bound in vivo not only by E2Fs but also by members of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein family and by RNA polymerase II, suggesting that these fragments represent promoters regulated by E2F transcription complexes. In fact, database analysis indicates that all three fragments correspond to genomic DNA located just upstream of start sites for previously identified mRNAs. One clone, ChET 4, corresponds to the promoter region for beclin 1, a candidate tumor suppressor protein. We demonstrate that another of the clones, ChET 8, is strongly bound by E2F family members in vivo but does not contain a consensus E2F binding site. However, this fragment functions as a promoter whose activity can be repressed by E2F1. Finally, we demonstrate that the ChET 9 promoter contains a consensus E2F binding site, can be activated by E2F1, and drives expression of an mRNA that is upregulated in colon and liver tumors. Interestingly, the characterized ChET promoters do not display regulation patterns typical of known E2F target genes in a U937 cell differentiation system. In summary, we have provided evidence that chromatin immunoprecipitation can be used to identify E2F-regulated promoters which contain both consensus and nonconsensus binding sites and have shown that not all E2F-regulated promoters show identical expression profiles.
11867748	GATA-1 binding sites mapped in the beta-globin locus by using mammalian chIp-chip analysis.	The expression of the beta-like globin genes is intricately regulated by a series of both general and tissue-restricted transcription factors. The hemapoietic lineage-specific transcription factor GATA-1 is important for erythroid differentiation and has been implicated in regulating the expression of the erythroid-specific genes including the genes of the beta-globin locus. In the human erythroleukemic K562 cell line, only one DNA region has been identified previously as a putative site of GATA-1 interaction by in vivo footprinting studies. We mapped GATA-1 binding throughout the beta-globin locus by using chIp-chip analysis of K562 cells. We found that GATA-1 binds in a region encompassing the HS2 core element, as was previously identified, and an additional region of GATA-1 binding upstream of the gammaG gene. This approach will be of general utility for mapping transcription factor binding sites within the beta-globin locus and throughout the genome.
12213815	Identification of direct p73 target genes combining DNA microarray and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses.	The newly discovered p53 family member, p73, has a striking homology to p53 in both sequence and modular structure. Ectopic expression of p73 promotes transcription of p53 target genes and recapitulates the most characterized p53 biological effects such as growth arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation. Unlike p53-deficient mice that develop normally but are subject to spontaneous tumor formation, p73-deficient mice exhibit severe defects in the development of central nervous system and suffer from inflammation but are not prone to tumor development. These phenotypes suggest different biological activities mediated by p53 and p73 that might reflect activation of specific sets of target genes. Here, we have analyzed the gene expression profile of H1299 cells after p73alpha or p53 activation using oligonucleotide microarrays capable of detecting approximately 11,000 mRNA species. Our results indicate that p73alpha and p53 activate both common and distinct groups of genes. We found 141 and 320 genes whose expression is modulated by p73alpha and p53, respectively. p73alpha up-regulates 85 genes, whereas p53 induces 153 genes, of which 27 are in common with p73alpha. Functional classification of these genes reveals that they are involved in many aspects of cell function ranging from cell cycle and apoptosis to DNA repair. Furthermore, we report that some of the up-regulated genes are directly activated by p73alpha or p53.
12364596	Human Mcm proteins at a replication origin during the G1 to S phase transition.	Previous work with yeast cells and with Xenopus egg extracts had shown that eukaryotic pre-replication complexes assemble on chromatin in a step-wise manner whereby specific loading factors promote the recruitment of essential Mcm proteins at pre-bound origin recognition complexes (ORC with proteins Orc1p-Orc6p). While the order of assembly--Mcm binding follows ORC binding--seems to be conserved in cycling mammalian cells in culture, it has not been determined whether mammalian Mcm proteins associate with ORC-bearing chromatin sites. We have used a chromatin immunoprecipitation approach to investigate the site of Mcm binding in a genomic region that has previously been shown to contain an ORC-binding site and an origin of replication. Using chromatin from HeLa cells in G1 phase, antibodies against Orc2p as well as antibodies against Mcm proteins specifically immunoprecipitate chromatin enriched for a DNA region that includes a replication origin. However, with chromatin from cells in S phase, only Orc2p-specific antibodies immunoprecipitate the origin-containing DNA region while Mcm-specific antibodies immunoprecipitate chromatin with DNA from all parts of the genomic region investigated. Thus, human Mcm proteins first assemble at or adjacent to bound ORC and move to other sites during genome replication.
9443820	Characterization of the binding of nuclear envelope precursor vesicles and chromatin, and purification of the vesicles.	The binding of nuclear envelope precursor vesicles and chromatin was characterized by using an in vitro system constituted from a Xenopus egg extract and demembranated Xenopus sperm chromatin. The results of binding studies in the presence of salts, urea, and a chelator showed that the binding involves an ionic interaction. Chemical modification studies suggested that a protein(s) in the vesicles, which is responsible for the binding with chromatin, has essential lysine, histidine, and methionine residues. The vesicle protein could not be extracted from vesicles with 1 M KCl, 2 M urea, or 0.1 M Na2CO3, suggesting that it is an intrinsic membrane protein. The protein was denatured with 8 M urea and 0.1 M Na2CO3, and could be renatured by incubation at 23 degrees C, suggesting that the native conformation of the protein is important for the binding. Affinity purification of nuclear envelope precursor vesicles was achieved by binding to chromatin and dissociation with 0.24 M NaCl. The vesicle fraction thus obtained exhibited the ability to form nuclear envelope on incubation with chromatin in Xenopus egg cytosol without any other membrane fraction. These results suggested that there is a nuclear envelope precursor vesicle population containing both a chromatin targeting protein and vesicle fusion machinery.
10218619	Protective effects of ischemic preconditioning on lung ischemia reperfusion injury: an in-vivo rabbit study.	BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to determine the effect of ischemic preconditioning on the extent of normothermic lung ischemia reperfusion injury in rabbits in vivo. METHODS: Thirty male Japanese white rabbits were randomized into two groups. Fifteen rabbits were treated with ischemic preconditioning (their left lung hilus clamped for 10 minutes and released for 15 minutes (group IP)). Fifteen rabbits were not treated with ischemic preconditioning (group C). Then the left lung hilus of both groups were occluded for 60 minutes and reperfused for 60 minutes. Mean arterial pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, and core temperature were recorded. Femoral artery blood samples and lung tissue samples were collected after ischemic preconditioning and after 60 minutes of reperfusion. RESULTS: The lung tissue showed little injury after ischemic preconditioning. After 60 minutes of reperfusion, the angiotensin II (A II) and arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) levels in group IP were significantly higher than those in group C, mean pulmonary artery pressure in group IP was significantly lower than that in group C, the wet/dry ratio and malondialdehyde content of lung tissue in group IP was significantly lower than that in group C, the superoxide dismutase contents of lung tissue in group IP was significantly higher than that in group C, and histological findings showed less damage in group IP than in group C. CONCLUSION: Lung ischemic preconditioning could reduce normothermic rabbit lung ischemia-reperfusion injury. The possible mechanisms are increased production of endogenous A II and reduced formation of oxygen free radicals during lung ischemia for 60 minutes followed by reperfusion for 60 minutes.
10498903	Distinction between AP1 and NF-E2 factor-binding at specific chromatin regions in mammalian cells.	Specific nuclear factor-DNA complexes formed within the promoters and enhancers are essential for transcriptional regulation. For eukaryotic systems, however, some DNA motif(s) are capable of binding to a family of related factors, thus making it difficult to identify the factor actually binding on the chromatic DNA in vivo and modulating the local transcription processes. To resolve this matter, we have refined a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Using the assay, we could directly link the regulatory functions of two members of the AP1/NF-E2 transcription factor family and their stable binding in vivo within distinct chromatin regions. The study demonstrated the feasibility of a general scheme in the determination of the identity of specific factor(s), among a group of family members, bound at unique sequence(s) in living mammalian cells.
11254108	DNA-protein cross-linking in nuclei of immature and mature chicken erythrocytes.	DNA-protein cross-linkages were formed in isolated nuclei from immature and mature chicken erythrocytes by reaction with cis-diammine dichloroplatinum. On the basis of electrophoretic behaviour, the most abundant proteins involved in the cross-linking appeared to be present also in preparations of nuclear matrix. The maturation of the erythrocyte, which is accompanied by transcriptional inactivation, leads to a decrease in the amount of DNA-interacting proteins, to a loss of proteins capable of a specific recognition of DNA sequences and, unexpectedly, to the appearence of some new DNA-protein interactions. At least three cross-linked proteins were found predominantly or exclusively in nuclei of immature cells, and three others in those of mature ones. The three DNA-bound proteins, typical of mature erythrocytes, were not found among the components of a high-salt preparation of nuclear matrix. The results obtained suggest that, in addition to the well-known histone H5 and MENT protein, these newly identified DNA-bound proteins contribute to the formation of the condensed, inactive chromatin characteristic of mature erythrocyte.
11517328	Human DNA replication initiation factors, ORC and MCM, associate with oriP of Epstein-Barr virus.	The 165-kb chromosome of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is replicated by cellular enzymes only once per cell cycle in human cells that are latently infected. Here, we report that the human origin recognition complex, ORC, can be detected in association with an EBV replication origin, oriP, in cells by using antibodies against three different subunits of human ORC to precipitate crosslinked chromatin. Mcm2, a subunit of the MCM replication licensing complex, was found to associate with oriP during G(1) and to dissociate from it during S phase. The detection of ORC and Mcm2 at oriP was shown to require the presence of the 120-bp replicator of oriP. Licensing and initiation of replication at oriP of EBV thus seem to be mediated by ORC. This is an example of a virus apparently using ORC and associated factors for the propagation of its genome.
12417704	Centromeric retroelements and satellites interact with maize kinetochore protein CENH3.	Maize centromeres are composed of CentC tandem repeat arrays, centromeric retrotransposons (CRs), and a variety of other repeats. One particularly well-conserved CR element, CRM, occurs primarily as complete and uninterrupted elements and is interspersed thoroughly with CentC at the light microscopic level. To determine if these major centromeric DNAs are part of the functional centromere/kinetochore complex, we generated antiserum to maize centromeric histone H3 (CENH3). CENH3, a highly conserved protein that replaces histone H3 in centromeres, is thought to recruit many of the proteins required for chromosome movement. CENH3 is present throughout the cell cycle and colocalizes with the kinetochore protein CENPC in meiotic cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrates that CentC and CRM interact specifically with CENH3, whereas knob repeats and Tekay retroelements do not. Approximately 38 and 33% of CentC and CRM are precipitated in the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, consistent with data showing that much, but not all, of CENH3 colocalizes with CentC.
12490152	In vivo functional dissection of human inner kinetochore protein CENP-C.	CENP-C is a fundamental component of the inner kinetochore plate and contributes to the formation of functional centromeres in eukaryotic organisms. Recruitment of CENP-C to kinetochore requires other centromere proteins, particularly CENP-A, CENP-H, and CENP-I. However, how CENP-C is correctly localized at the kinetochore is not clearly determined, mainly due to the functional variety of its domains, which hints at a complex recruitment mechanism. Here, by both immunofluorescent labeling and chromatin/immunoprecipitation we could show that human CENP-C contains two distinct domains, one in the central region, between amino acids 426 and 537, and the second one in the carboxyl terminal region, between amino acids 638 and 943, which are both capable of localizing at centromeres and binding alpha-satellite DNA. The presence of two domains that iterate the same function despite being significantly different in their amino acid sequence and structure suggests that CENP-C may target the centromere by establishing multiple contacts with both the DNA and protein constituents of the kinetochore.
12490953	Role for a Drosophila Myb-containing protein complex in site-specific DNA replication.	There is considerable interest in the developmental, temporal and tissue-specific patterns of DNA replication in metazoans. Site-specific DNA replication at the chorion loci in Drosophila follicle cells leads to extensive gene amplification, and the organization of the cis-acting DNA elements that regulate this process may provide a model for how such regulation is achieved. Two elements important for amplification of the third chromosome chorion gene cluster, ACE3 and Ori-beta, are directly bound by Orc (origin recognition complex), and two-dimensional gel analysis has revealed that the primary origin used is Ori-beta (refs 7-9). Here we show that the Drosophila homologue of the Myb (Myeloblastosis) oncoprotein family is tightly associated with four additional proteins, and that the complex binds site-specifically to these regulatory DNA elements. Drosophila Myb is required in trans for gene amplification, showing that a Myb protein is directly involved in DNA replication. A Drosophila Myb binding site, as well as the binding site for another Myb complex member (p120), is necessary in cis for replication of reporter transgenes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments localize both proteins to the chorion loci in vivo. These data provide evidence that specific protein complexes bound to replication enhancer elements work together with the general replication machinery for site-specific origin utilization during replication.
7933113	Activation of adenovirus-coded protease and processing of preterminal protein.	Adenoviruses code for a protease that is essential for infectivity and is activated by a disulfide-linked peptide, derived from the C terminus of the virus structural protein pVI (pVI-CT). The protease was synthesized at relatively high levels late in infection and was detected in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of adenovirus-infected cells. DNA was not found to be a cofactor of the protease, as previously proposed (W. F. Mangel, W. J. McGrath, D. Toledo, and C. W. Anderson, Nature [London] 361:274-275, 1993), but a role for DNA in facilitating the activation of the protease by pVI-CT in vivo cannot be ruled out. Adenovirus preterminal protein is a substrate for the virus-coded protease, with digestion to the mature terminal protein proceeding via the formation of two intermediates. Each of the three cleavage sites in the preterminal protein was identified by N-terminal sequencing and shown to conform to the substrate specificity of adenovirus protease, (M,L,I)XGX-X. Functional studies revealed that preterminal protein and intermediates but not mature terminal protein associated with adenovirus polymerase, while only the intact preterminal protein and none of its digestion products bound to DNA. These results suggest that the virus-coded protease may influence viral DNA replication by cleavage of both genome-bound and freely soluble preterminal protein, with consequent alterations to their functional properties.
8980231	RSC, an essential, abundant chromatin-remodeling complex.	A novel 15-subunit complex with the capacity to remodel the structure of chromatin, termed RSC, has been isolated from S. cerevisiae on the basis of homology to the SWI/SNF complex. At least three RSC subunits are related to SWI/SNF polypeptides: Sth1p, Rsc6p, and Rsc8p are significantly similar to Swi2/Snf2p, Swp73p, and Swi3p, respectively, and were identified by mass spectrometric and sequence analysis of peptide fragments. Like SWI/SNF, RSC exhibits a DNA-dependent ATPase activity stimulated by both free and nucleosomal DNA and a capacity to perturb nucleosome structure. RSC is, however, at least 10-fold more abundant than SWI/SNF complex and is essential for mitotic growth. Contrary to a report for SWII/SNF complex, no association of RSC (nor of SWI/SNF complex) with RNA polymerase II holoenzyme was detected.
10333179	Effect of in vivo histone hyperacetylation on the state of chromatin fibers.	We evaluated the contribution of in vivo histone acetylation to the folding of chromatin into its higher-order structures. We have compared high-order folding patterns of hyperacetylated vs. unmodified chromatin in living green monkey kidney cells (CV1 line) using intercalator chloroquine diphospate to induce alterations in the twist of internucleosomal linker DNA. We have shown that histone hyperacetylation induced by antibiotic Trichostatin A significantly alters intercalator-mediated chromatin folding pattern.
10889043	Differential in vivo modifications of the HMGI(Y) nonhistone chromatin proteins modulate nucleosome and DNA interactions.	"The HMGI(Y) family of ""high mobility group"" nonhistone proteins are architectural transcription factors whose overexpression is highly correlated with both cancerous transformation and increased malignancy and metastatic potential of tumors in vivo. Here we report on the types of posttranslational modifications found in vivo on the HMG-I and HMG-Y proteins isolated from two human breast epithelial cell lines, MCF-7 and MCF-7/PKC-alpha, that represent different stages of neoplastic progression. The MCF-7 cell line exhibits many characteristics of normal breast epithelial cells and does not form tumors when injected into nude mice, whereas the MCF-7/PKC-alpha cell line, a derivative of MCF-7 that expresses a transgene coding for the enzyme protein kinase C-alpha (PKC-alpha), is both malignant and highly metastatic. Using MALDI mass spectrometry, we show that the HMG-Y protein is more highly modified than the HMG-I protein in both the MCF-7 and the MCF-7/PKC-alpha cells. Significantly, the HMG-Y protein isolated from the highly metastatic MCF-7/PKC-alpha cells possesses a unique constellation of phosphorylations, methylations, and acetylations not found on the HMG-I protein isolated from either the MCF-7 or MCF-7/PKC-alpha cells. We further demonstrate that some of the same amino acid residues phosphorylated on recombinant HMGI(Y) proteins by purified PKC in vitro are also phosphorylated on the HMG-I(Y) proteins isolated from MCF-7/PKC-alpha cells, suggesting that PKC phosphorylates these proteins in vivo. Quantitative substrate binding analyses indicate that the biochemical modifications present on the HMG-I and HMG-Y proteins differentially influence the ability of these proteins to interact with both A.T-rich DNA substrates and nucleosome core particles in vitro, suggesting a similar modulation of such binding affinities in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of differences in the types of in vivo biochemical modifications found on the HMG-I and HMG-Y proteins in cells and also the first experimental evidence suggesting a possible linkage between such posttranslational modifications and the neoplastic potential of cells."
11094072	c-Myb binds to a sequence in the proximal region of the RAG-2 promoter and is essential for promoter activity in T-lineage cells.	The RAG-2 gene encodes a component of the V(D)J recombinase which is essential for the assembly of antigen receptor genes in B and T lymphocytes. Previously, we reported that the transcription factor BSAP (PAX-5) regulates the murine RAG-2 promoter in B-cell lines. A partially overlapping but distinct region of the proximal RAG-2 promoter was also identified as an important element for promoter activity in T cells; however, the responsible factor was unknown. In this report, we present data demonstrating that c-Myb binds to a Myb consensus site within the proximal promoter and is critical for its activity in T-lineage cells. We show that c-Myb can transactivate a RAG-2 promoter-reporter construct in cotransfection assays and that this transactivation depends on the proximal promoter Myb consensus site. By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) strategy, fractionation of chromatin with anti-c-Myb antibody specifically enriched endogenous RAG-2 promoter DNA sequences. DNase I genomic footprinting revealed that the c-Myb site is occupied in a tissue-specific fashion in vivo. Furthermore, an integrated RAG-2 promoter construct with mutations at the c-Myb site was not enriched in the ChIP assay, while a wild-type integrated promoter construct was enriched. Finally, this lack of binding of c-Myb to a chromosomally integrated mutant RAG-2 promoter construct in vivo was associated with a striking decrease in promoter activity. We conclude that c-Myb regulates the RAG-2 promoter in T cells by binding to this consensus c-Myb binding site.
11114889	Phosphorylation of histone H3 correlates with transcriptionally active loci.	Posttranslational modifications of the N-terminal tails of the core histones within the nucleosome particle are thought to act as signals from the chromatin to the cell for various processes. The experiments presented here show that the acetylation of histones H3 and H4 in polytene chromosomes does not change during heat shock. In contrast, the global level of phosphorylated H3 decreased dramatically during a heat shock, with an observed increase in H3 phosphorylation at the heat shock loci. Additional experiments confirm that this change in phosphorylated H3 distribution is dependent on functional heat shock transcription factor activity. These experiments suggest that H3 phosphorylation has an important role in the induction of transcription during the heat shock response.
12409468	Heterogeneity in the modification and involvement of chromatin components of the CpG island of the silenced human CDH1 gene in cancer cells.	The structural alteration of chromatin has a key role in regulating gene expression. The alteration of chromatin is mediated by modification of its components. Detailed understanding of the relationship between these modifications, notably, methylation of the full-length CpG island, the association of methyl-CpG binding proteins (MBPs), and the acetylation and methylation of histones in gene silencing is vitally important. Currently, however, the manner in which chromatin components, associated with a specific gene, are modified is poorly understood. Here we provide in vivo evidence in cancer cells of the differential association between CpG methylation, MBPs, and histone modification in the entire CpG island of the human E-cadherin (CDH1) gene. Of the cell lines with CDH1 transcriptional repression, the distribution of methyl-CpGs in the CpG island differed markedly. In a cell line with gene silencing, the promoter region was almost methylation-free. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that the acetylation status of histone H4 differed between cell lines. However, deacetylated histone H3 was associated with the CpG island in all silenced cell lines. Binding of MeCP2 was also detected in all silenced cell lines. Additional binding of MBD1 protein was detected in a cell line in which the promoter region was poorly methylated and only histone H3 was deacetylated. Binding of MBD2 protein was detected in all other silenced cell lines. Histone H3 lysine 9 was methylated in all silenced cells, while histone H3 lysine 4 was methylated in some silenced cell lines. These results demonstrate that chromatin components associated with inactive CDH1 chromatin is heterogeneously modified and suggests the presence of multiple pathways for the formation of inactive chromatin.
12528897	Increased exchange rate of histone H1 on chromatin by exogenous myogenin expression.	To explore the molecular mechanism of chromatin remodeling involved in the regulation of transcriptional activation of specific genes by a myogenic regulatory factor Myogenin, we used NIH3T3 fibroblasts with a stably integrated H1.1-GFP fusion protein to monitor histone H1 movement directly by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in living cells. The observation from FRAP experiments with myogenin transfected fibroblasts showed that the exchange rate of histone H1 in chromatin was obviously increased, indicating that forced expression of exogenous Myogenin can induce chromatin remodeling. The hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 from myogenin transfected fibroblasts was detected by triton-acid-urea (TAU)/SDS (2-D) electrophoresis and Western blot with specific antibodies against acetylated N-termini of histones H3 and H4. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the nAChR alpha-subunit gene was expressed in the transfected fibroblasts. These results suggest that the expression of exogenous Myogenin can induce chromatin remodeling and activate the transcription of Myogenin-targeted gene in non-muscle cells.
12624958	[Use of the modified method of chromatin immunoprecipitation for the isolation of actively transcribed loci].	A modified version of the chromosomal immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was implemented for discrete isolation and characterization of actively transcribed genes. Specifically, it was demonstrated with the gene II/9-1 of Sciara coprophila as a model locus that significant enhancement in the isolation of actively transcribed versus repressed and inactive genes can be achieved through the ChIP methodology. A combination of solid-phase magnetic bead technology with chromosomal immunoprecipitation using antibodies that recognize the large subunit (c) of RNA polymerase II resulted in efficient isolation of the promoter region of gene II/9-1 exclusively during the amplification stage of larval development, when the gene is actively transcribed. It is postulated that the novel technology described herein can be applied to a wide variety of systems for efficient isolation and in vivo assessment of actively transcribed genes regulated by virtually any given transcription factor.
12695333	Genomic targets of the human c-Myc protein.	The transcription factor Myc is induced by mitogenic signals and regulates downstream cellular responses. If overexpressed, Myc promotes malignant transformation. Myc modulates expression of diverse genes in experimental systems, but few are proven direct targets. Here, we present a large-scale screen for genomic Myc-binding sites in live human cells. We used bioinformatics to select consensus DNA elements (CACGTG or E-boxes) situated in the 5' regulatory region of genes and measured Myc binding to those sequences in vivo by quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation. Strikingly, most promoter-associated E-boxes showed selective recovery with Myc, unlike non-E-box promoters or E-boxes in bulk genomic DNA. Promoter E-boxes were distributed in two groups bound by Myc at distinct frequencies. The high-affinity group included an estimated 11% of all cellular loci, was highly conserved among different cells, and was bound independently of Myc expression levels. Overexpressed Myc associated at increased frequency with low-affinity targets and, at extreme levels, also with other sequences, suggesting that some binding was not sequence-specific. The strongest DNA-sequence parameter defining high-affinity targets was the location of E-boxes within CpG islands, correlating with an open, preacetylated state of chromatin. Myc further enhanced histone acetylation, with or without accompanying induction of mRNA expression. Our findings point to a high regulatory and biological diversity among Myc-target genes.
12819204	Organization and function of APT, a subcomplex of the yeast cleavage and polyadenylation factor involved in the formation of mRNA and small nucleolar RNA 3'-ends.	Messenger RNA 3'-end formation is functionally coupled to transcription by RNA polymerase II. By tagging and purifying Ref2, a non-essential protein previously implicated in mRNA cleavage and termination, we isolated a multiprotein complex, holo-CPF, containing the yeast cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) and six additional polypeptides. The latter can form a distinct complex, APT, in which Pti1, Swd2, a type I protein phosphatase (Glc7), Ssu72 (a TFIIB and RNA polymerase II-associated factor), Ref2, and Syc1 are associated with the Pta1 subunit of CPF. Systematic tagging and purification of holo-CPF subunits revealed that yeast extracts contain similar amounts of CPF and holo-CPF. By purifying holo-CPF from strains lacking Ref2 or containing truncated subunits, subcomplexes were isolated that revealed additional aspects of the architecture of APT and holo-CPF. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to localize Ref2, Ssu72, Pta1, and other APT subunits on small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes and primarily near the polyadenylation signals of the constitutively expressed PYK1 and PMA1 genes. Use of mutant components of APT revealed that Ssu72 is important for preventing readthrough-dependent expression of downstream genes for both snoRNAs and polyadenylated transcripts. Ref2 and Pta1 similarly affect at least one snoRNA transcript.
8682808	PstB protein of the phosphate-specific transport system of Escherichia coli is an ATPase.	The PstB protein of the phosphate-specific transport (Pst) system of Escherichia coli bound and hydrolyzed ATP, producing ADP. Urea-treated denatured PstB did not bind ATP. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the immune serum-precipitable PstB protein was determined, and it corresponded to that deduced from the DNA sequence.
10619130	The mammalian centromere: structural domains and the attenuation of chromatin modeling.	The centromere-kinetochore complex can be divided into distinct domains based on structure and function. Previous work has used CREST auto-antibodies with various microscopic techniques to map the locations of proteins within the centromere-kinetochore complex and to analyze the maturation of prekinetochores before mitosis. Here we have focused on the centromere-specific histone Centromere Protein (CENP)-A and its spatial relationship to other histones and histone modifications found in condensed chromatin. We demonstrate that the phosphorylation of histone H3 is essentially excluded from a specific region of centromeric chromatin, defined by the presence of CENP-A. Interspersion of CENP-B with phosphorylated H3 in the inner centromere indicates that the exclusion of H3 modification is not a general property of alpha-satellite DNA. We also demonstrate that these regions are functionally distinct by fragmenting mitotic chromatin into motile centromere-kinetochore fragments that contain CENP-A with little or no phosphorylated H3 and nonmotile fragments that contain exclusively phosphorylated H3. The sequence of CENP-A diverges from H3 in a number of key residues involved in chromosome condensation and in transcription, potentially allowing a more specialized chromatin structure within centromeric heterochromatin, on which kinetochore plates may nucleate and mature. This specialized centromere subdomain would be predicted to have a very tight and static nucleosome structure as a result of the absence of H3 phosphorylation and acetylation.
11239001	Chromatin-bound PCNA complex formation triggered by DNA damage occurs independent of the ATM gene product in human cells.	Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a processivity factor for DNA polymerases delta and epsilon, is involved in DNA replication as well as in diverse DNA repair pathways. In quiescent cells, UV light-induced bulky DNA damage triggers the transition of PCNA from a soluble to an insoluble chromatin-bound form, which is intimately associated with the repair synthesis by polymerases delta and epsilon. In this study, we investigated the efficiency of PCNA complex formation in response to ionizing radiation-induced DNA strand breaks in normal and radiation-sensitive Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) cells by immunofluorescence and western blot techniques. Exposure of normal cells to gamma-rays rapidly triggered the formation of PCNA foci in a dose-dependent manner in the nuclei and the PCNA foci (40-45%) co-localized with sites of repair synthesis detected by bromodeoxyuridine labeling. The chromatin-bound PCNA gradually declined with increasing post-irradiation times and almost reached the level of unirradiated cells by 6 h. The PCNA foci formed after gamma-irradiation was resistant to high salt extraction and the chromatin association of PCNA was lost after DNase I digestion. Interestingly, two radiosensitive primary fibroblast cell lines, derived from AT patients harboring homozygous mutations in the ATM gene, displayed an efficient PCNA redistribution after gamma-irradiation. We also analyzed the PCNA complex induced by a radiomimetic agent, Bleomycin (BLM), which produces predominantly single- and double-strand DNA breaks. The efficiency and the time course of PCNA complex induced by BLM were identical in both normal and AT cells. Our study demonstrates for the first time that the ATM gene product is not required for PCNA complex assembly in response to DNA strand breaks. Additionally, we observed an increased interaction of PCNA with the Ku70 and Ku80 heterodimer after DNA damage, suggestive of a role for PCNA in the non-homologous end-joining repair pathway of DNA strand breaks.
12052885	Kinetics of a gamma interferon response: expression and assembly of CIITA promoter IV and inhibition by methylation.	Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were employed to assess the kinetics of transcription factor assembly and histone modifications that occur during gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) induction of CIITA gene expression. CIITA is the master regulator of major histocompatibility complex class II transcription. Promoter IV (PIV), the major IFN-gamma responsive promoter for CIITA expression, requires both STAT1 and IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) for induction by IFN-gamma. STAT1 binding to PIV was detected first and was accompanied by a modest acetylation of histones H3 and H4 that were associated with the region. Despite these changes, which occurred within 30 min of IFN-gamma treatment, CIITA mRNA was not detected until IRF-1 protein was synthesized and bound to its site, a process that required >120 min. In contrast to these events, fetal trophoblast-like cell lines, which are refractory to CIITA induction by IFN-gamma, failed to assemble the above factors or modify their chromatin, suggesting that accessibility to the promoter is blocked. Bisulfite sequencing of PIV showed strong hypermethylation of PIV, providing a link between methylation, chromatin structure, and factor binding. Together, this analysis provides a kinetic view of the activation of the CIITA gene in response to IFN-gamma and shows that regulatory factor assembly, chromatin modification, and gene expression proceed in discrete steps.
12054899	Localizing transcription factors on chromatin by immunofluorescence.	This article contains a detailed protocol for localizing transcription factors on Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes by immunofluorescence. The large polytene chromosomes from third-instar larval salivary gland cells allow mapping of chromosome-associated proteins at high resolution. Thus, this method has been used to investigate how broadly transcription factors function and to identify and characterize cis-acting protein domains, trans-acting proteins, and trans-acting DNA elements that are necessary for chromosomal association of transcription factors. The ability to directly visualize transcription factors bound to chromosomes during a transcriptionally active stage of the cell cycle has greatly enhanced our understanding of how transcription factors function in vivo.
12620799	Chromatin repression by COUP-TFII and HDAC dominates activation by NF-kappaB in regulating major histocompatibility complex class I transcription in adenovirus tumorigenic cells.	In adenovirus type 12 transformed cells, the down-regulation of MHC class I transcription contributes to the tumorigenic phenotype and is solely mediated by Ad12 E1A. Previous in vitro studies with class I enhancer sequences have indicated that there is an increased binding of repressor COUP-TFII and its associated HDAC and a decreased binding of activator NF-kappaB. In this study, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay in order to determine in vivo whether these proteins regulate class I transcription by affecting chromatin. The ChIP assay revealed that there is lack of chromatin histone acetylation in the region of the class I enhancer in Ad12-transformed cells. This is regulated by histone deacetylation as it was further demonstrated in vivo that COUP-TFII and HDAC are associated with the class I enhancer chromatin. In agreement with in vitro studies, NF-kappaB could be recruited to the class I enhancer following induction by TNF-alpha. However, this enhancer-bound NF-kappaB failed to up-regulate class I expression because the class I enhancer chromatin remained repressed as a result of histone deacetylation by HDAC in association with COUP-TFII. Thus, we have demonstrated for the first time that repression of chromatin through histone deacetylation is a major mechanism in down-regulating class I transcription in Ad12-transformed cells. Finally, Ad12 E1A, a non-DNA binding protein, was shown to be present in the natural protein complex bound to the class I enhancer.
14581449	Architecture of the budding yeast kinetochore reveals a conserved molecular core.	How kinetochore proteins are organized to connect chromosomes to spindle microtubules, and whether any structural and organizational themes are common to kinetochores from distantly related organisms, are key unanswered questions. Here, we used affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry to generate a map of kinetochore protein interactions. The budding yeast CENP-C homologue Mif2p specifically copurified with histones H2A, H2B, and H4, and with the histone H3-like CENP-A homologue Cse4p, strongly suggesting that Cse4p replaces histone H3 in a specialized centromeric nucleosome. A novel four-protein Mtw1 complex, the Nnf1p subunit of which has homology to the vertebrate kinetochore protein CENP-H, also copurified with Mif2p and a variety of central kinetochore proteins. We show that Mif2 is a critical in vivo target of the Aurora kinase Ipl1p. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated the biological relevance of these associations. We propose that a molecular core consisting of CENP-A, -C, -H, and Ndc80/HEC has been conserved from yeast to humans to link centromeres to spindle microtubules.
8605878	Chromatin binding, nuclear localization and phosphorylation of Xenopus cdc21 are cell-cycle dependent and associated with the control of initiation of DNA replication.	A Xenopus homologue of Schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc21 has been characterized as a new member of the MCM family of proteins. The cdc21 protein exhibits cell-cycle dependent chromatin binding and phosphorylation in association with S-phase control. Cdc21 binds to decondensing chromatin at the end of mitosis, localizing to numerous foci which form prior to reconstitution of the nuclear membrane. The association of cdc21 with chromatin occurs in membrane-free high speed extracts and is resistant to detergent extraction. The spatial organization of the cdc21 foci resembles that of pre-replication centres though no co-localization with RP-A was observed. Cdc21 remains bound to chromatin during the initiation of DNA replication and is displaced as the DNA replication forks progress. These subnuclear changes in localization correlate with cell-cycle-regulated changes in phosphorylation. Cdc21 binds to chromatin in an underphosphorylated state, but in early S phase the nuclear localized cdc21 is partially phosphorylated before it is displaced from the chromatin. Cytoplasmic cdc21 remains underphosphorylated but at the beginning of mitosis the entire pool of cdc21 is hyperphosphorylated, possibly by the cdc2/cyclin B kinase. These properties identify Xenopus cdc21 as a possible component of the DNA licensing factor.
9576905	The chromatin unfolding domain of chromosomal protein HMG-14 targets the N-terminal tail of histone H3 in nucleosomes.	Nonhistone chromosomal protein HMG-14 is a nucleosomal binding protein that unfolds the higher-order chromatin structure and enhances the transcriptional potential of chromatin, but not that of DNA. Both the transcriptional enhancement and the chromatin unfolding activities of HMG-14 are mediated through the C-terminal region of the protein. Here we study the molecular interactions of both this region and the N-terminal region of HMG-14 with nucleosome cores. By protein photocrosslinking we demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of HMG-14 targets a restricted region in histone H2B, whereas the C-terminal chromatin unfolding domain of HMG-14 targets a restricted region in the N terminus of histone H3. The N-terminal regions of the core histones are involved in the folding of oligonucleosomes and are the target of various activities associated with chromatin unfolding and transcriptional activation. We suggest that specific interactions between the C-terminal domain of HMG-14 and the N-terminal tail of histone H3 reduce the compaction of chromatin. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism whereby HMG-14/-17 proteins reduce the repressive effect of chromatin, and they also broaden the scope of the molecular interactions involving the N termini of the core histones in nucleosomes.
10962580	Identification of genomic DNA sequences bound by mutant p53 protein (Gly245-->Ser) in vivo.	Mutant p53 proteins were shown to exert complex DNA-interactions in vitro, like binding to MAR-DNA, but so far it is unknown whether such interactions also occur in vivo. Therefore we analysed the binding of mutant (mut) p53 (Gly245-->Ser) in Onda 11 glioma cells to cellular DNA in vivo, using p53-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) after in vivo cross-linking of mut p53 to genomic DNA with cisplatin. We identified genomic DNA fragments to which mut p53 (Gly245-->Ser) could be cross-linked in vivo. Purified recombinant mut p53 (Gly245-->Ser) was able to bind specifically to such elements in PCR-EMSA in vitro, supporting the idea that this mut p53 protein interacts with genomic DNA in vivo. The genomic DNA fragments identified are vastly different in sequence, but display as a common feature a high likelihood to adopt a non B-DNA conformation. Therefore we propose that structural determinants within these DNA elements are important for their interaction with mut p53 (Gly245-->Ser) in vivo. Oncogene (2000) 19, 4178 - 4183
11266125	Identification of a nuclear protein ArpN as a component of human SWI/SNF complex and its selective association with a subset of active genes.	The hSWI/SNF complex remodels the chromatin structure to modulate gene expression. The hSWI/SNF complex is a multiprotein complex with at least 10 different proteins in mammals. In this study, we identified the 45 kDa subunit of the hSWI/SNF complex as ArpN, an actin-related protein. ArpN has a 36% identity and 50% similarity with the human beta-actin, but cannot be classified into any known class of actin-related proteins. ArpN is exclusively localized within the nucleus and appears as the unbound, chromatin-associated, or nuclear matrix associated forms in the nucleus. In the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we found the associations of ArpN with the Ets-2 and c-mycP2 promoter regions in HeLa cells. The promoter regions of the hsp70, cyclophilin, beta-globin, TdT, and cd4 genes, however, were not associated with ArpN. The Ets-2 and c-mycP2 genes are expressed actively in HeLa cells, but beta-globin, TdT, and cd4 genes are inactive. The hsp70 and cyclophilin genes have a feature of stress-inducibility. These selective associations of ArpN with a subset of active genes support the proposition that the requirement of hSWI/SNF complex in gene activation is gene specific.
11583633	Molecular mechanisms mediating methylation-dependent silencing of ribosomal gene transcription.	Epigenetic control mechanisms silence about half of ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) in metabolically active cells. In the mouse, 40% of rDNA repeats are methylated and can be activated by 5-azacytidine treatment. In exploring the effect of methylation on rDNA transcription, we found that methylation of a single CpG dinucleotide within the upstream control element of the rDNA promoter (at -133) abrogates rDNA transcription both in transfection experiments and in in vitro assays using chromatin templates. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that methylation of the cytosine at -133 inhibits binding of the transcription factor UBF to nucleosomal rDNA, thereby preventing initiation complex formation. Thus, methylation may be a mechanism to inactivate rDNA genes and propagate transcriptional silencing through cell division.
11752617	Application of the chromatin immunoprecipitation method to identify in vivo protein-DNA associations in fission yeast.	The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) method provides an ideal tool for detecting direct or indirect interactions between proteins of interest and DNAs with known sequences. Here, we introduce the ChIP protocol used in our laboratory to identify in vivo protein-DNA association in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The cytological and genetic merits of the fission yeast for studying control of the eukaryotic cell cycle and chromosome dynamics are reinforced by application of this ChIP method.
11954959	Effect of ischemic preconditioning and mitochondrial KATP channel openers on chronic left ventricular remodeling in the ischemic-reperfused rat heart.	The influence of ischemic preconditioning (IP) and mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (mito-KATP) channel openers on chronic left ventricular (LV) remodeling remains unknown, so the effect of IP and mito-KATP channel openers on the LV pressure-volume curve was assessed in rats subjected to 30 min ischemia followed by a 3-week reperfusion. Infarct size was histologically determined at 3 weeks after reperfusion. The LV pressure-volume curve was significantly shifted left by IP, diazoxide and nicorandil compared with the controls. These effects were blocked by the selective mito-KATP channel blocker 5-hydroxydecanoate. The LV remodeling and the infarct size at 3 weeks after reperfusion correlated well, indicating that the reduction of LV remodeling in the ischemic-reperfused model was strongly influenced by attenuation of the ischemic injury. LV remodeling in the chronic phase is attenuated by IP and mito-KATP channel openers with concomitant reduction of infarct size.
12054902	Dissecting long-range transcriptional mechanisms by chromatin immunoprecipitation.	Analysis of physiological mechanisms that control transcription often requires extrapolation of in vitro measurements into in vivo mechanisms. This extrapolation is complex, as mammalian genes are commonly organized into broad chromosomal domains, and such domains cannot be readily reconstituted in vitro. Thus, the nucleoprotein structure of chromosomes constitutes a considerable impediment to elucidating transcriptional mechanisms. The development of assays to measure protein-DNA interactions and chromatin structure in living cells has greatly facilitated progress in understanding physiological transcriptional mechanisms. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a powerful approach that allows one to define the interaction of factors with specific chromosomal sites in living cells, thereby providing a snapshot of the native chromatin structure and factors bound to genes in different functional states. ChIP involves treating cells or tissue briefly with formaldehyde to crosslink proteins to DNA. An antibody against a protein suspected of binding a given cis-element is then used to immunoprecipitate chromatin fragments. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the immunoprecipitate with primers flanking the cis-element reveals whether a specific DNA sequence is recovered in an immune-specific manner and therefore whether the protein contacted the site in living cells. The central focus of this review is the use of ChIP to study transcriptional activation over long distances on chromosomes.
12740577	The role of DNA methylation in setting up chromatin structure during development.	DNA methylation inhibits gene expression in animal cells, probably by affecting chromatin structure. Biochemical studies suggest that this process may be mediated by methyl-specific binding proteins that recruit enzymatic machinery capable of locally altering histone modification. To test whether DNA methylation actually has a role in the assembly of chromatin during normal development, we used cell transfection and a transgene construct genetically programmed to be either methylated or unmethylated in all cell types of the mouse. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis shows that the presence of DNA methylation brings about the deacetylation of histone H4 and methylation of Lys9 of histone H3 (H3 Lys9) and prevents methylation of Lys4 of histone H3 (H3 Lys4), thus generating a structure identical to that of methylated sequences in the genome. These results indicate that the methylation pattern established in early embryogenesis is profoundly important in setting up the structural profile of the genome.
8993033	Analysis of chromatin structure by in vivo formaldehyde cross-linking.	Recent advances leave no doubt that higher order chromatin structures play a fundamental role in many developmentally important mechanisms of gene regulation. In particular analyses in genetic model systems like yeast and Drosophila uncovered novel proteins that are involved in the regulation of chromatin structures. Many of these proteins do not bind directly to DNA but interact in large multimeric complexes. To identify the DNA elements regulated by these multiprotein complexes, alternative approaches to the standard methods of DNA-protein analysis had to be devised. Here we present a method that preserves the architecture of the higher order chromatin structures by cross-linking cells in vivo with formaldehyde. An immunoprecipitation strategy is then used to identify the DNA targets of chromosomal proteins of interest. This method can be applied to study the distribution of proteins at high resolution over extended chromosomal regions.
9148910	Expression and characterization of the small subunit of human DNA polymerase delta.	DNA polymerase delta is a heterodimer consisting of a catalytic subunit of 125 kDa and a small subunit of 50 kDa (p50). We have overexpressed p50 in Escherichia coli and have characterized the recombinant protein. p50 was readily overexpressed using the pET vector as an insoluble protein. A procedure was developed for its purification and renaturation. Examination of the physicochemical properties of renatured p50 showed that it is a monomeric protein with an apparent molecular weight of 60,000, a Stokes radius of 34 A, and a sedimentation coefficient of 4.1 S. Its physical properties were indistinguishable from p50 expressed as a soluble protein using the pTACTAC vector. Examination of the effects of recombinant p50 on the activity of DNA polymerase delta showed that p50 is able to slightly stimulate (about 2-fold) the activity of the recombinant 125-kDa catalytic subunit using poly(dA).oligo(dT) as a template in the absence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. In the presence of proliferating cell nulear antigen, activity is stimulated about 5-fold. Seven stable hybridoma cell lines were established that produced monoclonal antibodies against p50. One of these antibodies (13D5) inhibited the activity of calf thymus DNA polymerase delta. This antibody, when coupled to a solid support, also was found to provide a method for the immunoafffinity purification of recombinant p50 and of DNA polymerase delta from calf thymus or HeLa extracts. Immunoprecipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays also confirmed that p50 interacts with the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase delta.
9169193	Chromatin studies by DNA-protein cross-linking.	Our current level of understanding of chromatin structure was to a large extent achieved with the help of DNA-protein cross-linking. The versatile inventory of cross-linking techniques allows the identification of the contacts between DNA and proteins with a single nucleotide-single amino acid precision, to detect minor components of the complex nucleoprotein systems, to reveal the interactions of the flexible protein domains with DNA, and to assay for conformational changes in the nucleosomes.
9446625	Chromatin structure in granulocytes. A link between tight compaction and accumulation of a heterochromatin-associated protein (MENT).	"To study the mechanism of heterochromatin formation in vertebrate cells, we isolated nuclei from chicken polymorphonuclear granulocytes and examined the chromatin organization. We found granulocyte chromatin to remain insoluble after nuclease digestion and to be resistant to swelling in low salt/high pH media. Both insolubility and resistance to swelling were lost after washing with 0.3 M NaCl, a procedure that released two abundant tissue-specific proteins from granulocyte nuclei. One of them (42 kDa) is identified as MENT, a protein previously shown to be associated with repressed chromatin from mature chicken erythrocytes. We show that MENT is immunolocalized in granulocyte heterochromatin, where it is one of the most abundant chromatin proteins ( approximately 2 molecules/200 base pairs of DNA). MENT is the first nuclear protein structurally related to the serine protease inhibitor family. The other abundant protein is similar to or identical with mim-1, a myeloid-specific protein that is known to be stored in cell granules and to associate with isolated nuclei. MENT (but not mim-1) binds chromatin and free DNA, and, at its physiological protein/DNA ratio, enhances compaction and the reversible Mg2+-dependent self-association of nucleosome arrays. MENT appears to promote the formation of heterochromatin by acting as a ""glue"" within and between chains of nucleosomes."
10471736	Crosslinking of proteins to DNA in human nuclei using a 60 femtosecond 266 nm laser.	We developed appropriate conditions to use a laser with 60 femtosecond pulses, a frequency of 1 KHz and a wavelength of 266 nm to efficiently crosslink proteins to DNA in human nuclei for the purpose of using immunoprecipitation to study the binding of specific proteins to specific sequences of DNA under native conditions. Irradiation of nuclei for 30 min with 1-3 GW/cm(2)pulses crosslinked 10-12% of total protein to DNA. The efficiency of crosslinking was dose and protein specific. Histones H1 and H3 were crosslinked by 15 min of irradiation with 20-25% efficiency, at least 10 times more strongly than the other histones, consistent with experiments using conventional UV light. Irradiation for 15 min did not damage proteins, as assayed by SDS-PAGE of Ku-70 and histones. Although the same level of irradiation did not cause double-strand breaks, it did make the DNA partially insensitive to Eco RI restriction enzyme, probably through formation of thymidine dimers. Immuno-analysis of crosslinked nucleoprotein showed that Ku crosslinking to nuclear DNA is detectable only in the presence of breaks in the DNA, and that nucleosomes are bound to a significant fraction of the telomeric repeat (TTAGGG) (n).
10654939	The organized chromatin domain of the repressed yeast a cell-specific gene STE6 contains two molecules of the corepressor Tup1p per nucleosome.	In yeast alpha cells the a cell-specific genes STE6 and BAR1 are packaged as gene-sized chromatin domains of positioned nucleosomes. Organized chromatin depends on Tup1p, a corepressor that interacts with the N-terminal regions of H3 and H4. If Tup1p functions to organize or stabilize a chromatin domain, the protein might be expected to be present at a level stoichiometric with nucleosomes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using Tup1p antibodies showed Tup1p to be associated with the entire genomic STE6 coding region. To determine stoichiometry of Tup1p associated with the gene, a yeast plasmid containing varying lengths of the STE6 gene including flanking control regions and an Escherichia coli lac operator sequence was constructed. After assembly into chromatin in vivo in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, minichromosomes were isolated using an immobilized lac repressor. In these experiments, Tup1p was found to be specifically associated with repressed STE6 chromatin in vivo at a ratio of about two molecules of the corepressor per nucleosome. These observations strongly suggest a structural role for Tup1p in repression and constrain models for organized chromatin in repressive domains.
11106744	ATP-driven chromatin remodeling activity and histone acetyltransferases act sequentially during transactivation by RAR/RXR In vitro.	"Using a ""crude"" chromatin-based transcription system that mimics transactivation by RAR/RXR heterodimers in vivo, we could not demonstrate that chromatin remodeling was required to relieve nucleosomal repression. Using ""purified"" chromatin templates, we show here that, irrespective of the presence of histone H1, both ATP-driven chromatin remodeling activities and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activities of coactivators recruited by liganded receptors are required to achieve transactivation. DNA footprinting, ChIP analysis, and order of addition experiments indicate that coactivator HAT activities and two ATP-driven remodeling activities are sequentially involved at distinct steps preceding initiation of transcription. Thus, both ATP-driven chromatin remodeling and HAT activities act in a temporally ordered and interdependent manner to alleviate the repressive effects of nucleosomal histones on transcription by RARalpha/RXRalpha heterodimers."
11809796	Identification of a binding region for human origin recognition complex proteins 1 and 2 that coincides with an origin of DNA replication.	We investigated the binding regions of components of the origin recognition complex (ORC) in the human genome. For this purpose, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with antibodies against human Orc1 and Orc2 proteins. We identified a binding region for human Orc proteins 1 and 2 in a <1-kbp segment between two divergently transcribed human genes. The region is characterized by CpG tracts and a central sequence rich in AT base pairs. Both, Orc1 and Orc2 proteins are found at the intergenic region in the G(1) phase, but S-phase chromatin contains only Orc2 protein, supporting the notion that Orc1p dissociates from its binding site in the S phase. Sequences corresponding to the intergenic region are highly abundant in a fraction of nascent DNA strands, strongly suggesting that this region not only harbors the binding sites for Orc1 protein and Orc2 protein but also serves as an origin of bidirectional DNA replication.
7606213	Cytochemical and immunocytochemical study of nuclear structures of Lacandonia schismatica.	The interphase nucleus of the cells of several tissues of Lacandonia schismatica was studied using electron microscopy cytochemical and immunocytochemical methods. The EDTA staining procedure, preferential for RNP, contrasted the Lacandonia granules and perichromatin fibrils. These granules were found to be relatively resistant to RNAse hydrolysis, but they were easily digested if RNAse treatment was carried out after a short hydrolysis with pronase. Bismuth oxynitrate stained granular structures about 17 nm in diameter and the periphery of a few Lacandonia granules. The anti-snURNPs bound to RNP-containing fibrils in the perichromatin and interchromatin space and also to the periphery of some Lacandonia granules. Immunolabeling of DNA demonstrated numerous filaments of extended chromatin in the perichromatin and interchromatin spaces which were closely related to Lacandonia granules. These observations suggested that Lacandonia granules are equivalent to Balbiani ring granules of nuclei with polytene chromosomes and to perichromatin granules of other plant and animal nuclei. The small number of Lacandonia granules labeled in their periphery by anti-snURNP mAb were interpreted as being immature granules in the process of formation. The external or annular part of the ring-shaped structures is heavily labeled by anti-URNP mAbs but scarcely stained by the EDTA procedure. These features indicate that this region contains abundant proteins associated with snURNAs but probably little snURNAs. The synaptonemal-like complexes previously found in the interphase nuclei of Lacandonia are formed by two parallel masses of compact chromatin, which react with anti-DNA, and a central clear space crossed by fiber.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
7998335	[Possibility of participation of proteins binding single-stranded DNA in eukaryotic DNA replication].	"Main properties of the single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSB-proteins) (type of the protein UP 1 from the calf thymus) have been analyzed. The combination of some properties allows one to say about the strong specificity of the term ""SSB-proteins type UP 1"" and their differences from the HMG-proteins and other DNA-binding proteins and enzymes. Basing on the data from literature and the author's data the hypothesis was made that eukaryotic SSB-proteins may be involved in DNA replication, though they have tight relationship with the proteins of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles. The following fact evidence for the involvement of SSB-proteins in DNA replication: 1) preferential affinity to the single-strand DNA in comparison with the single-strand RNA; 2) the contact between DNA SSB-proteins in chromatin; 3) strong proportional dependence between the content of SSB-proteins in chromatin and the intensity of DNA synthesis; 4) the dependence between the content of SSB-proteins in the cells and genomic size in different organisms; 5) the capacity of SSB-proteins to specific stimulation of DNA replicative synthesis. Apparently SSB-proteins in chromatin modulate the replication with the aid of the unwinding of DNA, stabilizing of the single-strand region in this molecule and the activation of the DNA synthesis carried out by DNA polymerase."
8729072	Effect of ischemic preconditioning on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and high energy phosphates in rat hearts.	The ability of ischemic preconditioning (IP) to protect the myocardium against prolonged ischemia may derive from improved energy balance. We therefore examined myocardial energy metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in isolated perfused rat hearts which were either subjected (IP group), or not subjected (control group), to preconditioning prior to 30 min sustained ischemia and 30 min reperfusion. Preconditioning was achieved with two cycles of 5 min ischemia followed by 5 min reperfusion. Recovery of myocardial function was significantly greater, and creatine kinase release was significantly lower, in the IP group. Although ATP hydrolysis during the sustained ischemia remained unchanged in both groups, greater preservation of high energy phosphate (eg. ATP and CP) was observed in the IP group after reperfusion. CP content immediately after preconditioning greatly exceeded pre-ischemic values. Lactate production during the sustained ischemia was significantly lower in the IP group, suggesting a decrease in anaerobic glycolysis and a probable attenuation of intracellular acidosis. Oligomycin-sensitive mitochondrial ATPase activity in the control group was significantly decreased both after the sustained ischemia and the reperfusion, but in the IP group it did not change after the preconditioning, sustained ischemia, or reperfusion. Although atractyloside-inhibitable adenine nucleotide translocase activity was markedly decreased during sustained ischemia in both groups, its activity was significantly higher after reperfusion in the IP group. These data suggest that (1) mitochondrial ATPase contributes only slightly to ATP depletion during sustained ischemia, (2) both the CP overshoot phenomenon and the decrease in anaerobic glycolysis can be attributable to cardioprotection during the sustained ischemia, and (3) the preservation of ATPase and adenine nucleotide translocase activities may be a possible explanation for the restoration of high energy phosphates after sustained ischemia-reperfusion injury in the preconditioned hearts of rats.
9256417	The N-terminal tail of histone H2A binds to two distinct sites within the nucleosome core.	"Each of the core histone proteins within the nucleosome has a central ""structured"" domain that comprises the spool onto which the DNA superhelix is wrapped and an N-terminal ""tail"" domain in which the structure and molecular interactions have not been rigorously defined. Recent studies have shown that the N-terminal domains of core histones probably contact both DNA and proteins within the nucleus and that these interactions play key roles in the regulation of nuclear processes (such as transcription and replication) and are critical in the formation of the chromatin fiber. An understanding of these complex mechanisms awaits identification of the DNA or protein sites within chromatin contacted by the tail domains. To this end, we have developed a site-specific histone protein-DNA photocross-linking method to identify the DNA binding sites of the N-terminal domains within chromatin complexes. With this approach, we demonstrate that the N-terminal tail of H2A binds DNA at two defined locations within isolated nucleosome cores centered around a position approximately 40 bp from the nucleosomal dyad and that this tail probably adopts a defined structure when bound to DNA."
9508309	Method for reduction of inhibition in a Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific ligase chain reaction DNA amplification assay.	The present study describes the identification of inhibitors of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific gap ligase chain reaction (LCR) DNA amplification assay as well as a method for their removal. A major contributor to inhibition was deduced to be a calcium phosphate precipitate, CaHPO4. The precipitate forms during N-acetyl-L-cysteine-sodium hydroxide (NALC-NaOH) decontamination, digestion, and concentration of respiratory specimens. The solubility product of CaHPO4 precipitate at pH 7.8, the pH at which gap LCR is optimized, indicates that the precipitate releases an amount of phosphate ions sufficient to inhibit amplification. A method for removal of the precipitate was identified. The precipitate is dissociated by exposing it to a mildly acidic (pH 4.1) buffer during the first of two centrifugation steps; the inhibitory phosphate ions are removed by the centrifugation steps. When 100 NALC-NaOH respiratory sediments were tested by gap LCR, none of the sediments were inhibitory when the acidic buffer was used while 24 samples were inhibitory when TE buffer, pH 7.8, was used. In another study, when the acidic buffer wash was applied to 1,440 NALC-NaOH respiratory sediments, only 10 sediments were found to be inhibitory. None of the inhibited sediments were culture positive for M. tuberculosis. This work demonstrates that when inhibition mechanisms are identified, relatively simple protocols can be used to obtain low inhibition rates and to allow the use of larger volume equivalents in amplification reactions.
10479622	Crystallization and preliminary diffraction data of 60-kDa glycosylated pollen isoallergens from Bermuda grass.	Crystals grown from a 60-kDa isoallergen mixture of Bermuda grass pollen have been obtained in 30% PEG 4000 and 25% isopropanol. The crystals diffract beyond 2-A resolution and belong to a tetragonal space group with the unit cell dimensions a = b = 86 A and c = 310 A. The preferential crystal growth of the larger isoallergens with a blocked N-terminus indicates that crystallization can isolate proteins with compact conformation.
11138610	Modified salting-out method for DNA isolation from newborn cord blood nucleated cells.	The present work describes modification of a widely used salting-out procedure to rapidly extract DNA suitable for PCR, using the ARMS method to amplify a target sequence in the beta-globin gene. The salting-out DNA extraction procedure did not completely remove or decrease the presence of inhibitors to PCR in a considerable number of cord blood samples. By introducing a simple phenol/chloroform step, before ethanol precipitation of the nucleic acid, to certain samples, we were able to eliminate or substantially reduce the presence of inhibitors to PCR without having to re-extract the samples.
11842291	Histone deacetylation inhibits IL4 gene expression in T cells.	BACKGROUND: Dysregulated expression of IL-4 has been linked with allergic diseases. IL-4 expression is controlled at the level of gene transcription by the coordinated action of multiple factors that bind regulatory promoter elements. In addition, alterations in chromatin structure are thought to play a role in regulating the expression of cytokines in the T(H)2 gene cluster, although the biochemical basis for these alterations in human T cells is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: We sought to define the role of histone acetylation in the regulation of IL4 gene expression in human T cells. METHODS: IL-4 protein production was measured by means of ELISA. IL-4 promoter activity was measured with luciferase-based reporter constructs transiently transfected into Jurkat T cells. The acetylation status of histones associated with the IL4 gene was analyzed with chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. RESULTS: IL-4 production from activated peripheral blood T cells was enhanced by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. Overexpression of the type 1 histone deacetylases 1, 2, and 3 inhibited transcription driven by the IL-4 promoter in Jurkat T cells, whereas cotransfection of the histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein potentiated IL-4 promoter activity. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we show that nucleosomes in the proximal IL-4 promoter are acetylated on T-cell activation. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the acetylation state of histones associated with the IL-4 promoter is a key regulator of IL4 gene expression.
12857954	GATA-1-dependent transcriptional repression of GATA-2 via disruption of positive autoregulation and domain-wide chromatin remodeling.	Interplay among GATA transcription factors is an important determinant of cell fate during hematopoiesis. Although GATA-2 regulates hematopoietic stem cell function, mechanisms controlling GATA-2 expression are undefined. Of particular interest is the repression of GATA-2, because sustained GATA-2 expression in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells alters hematopoiesis. GATA-2 transcription is derepressed in erythroid precursors lacking GATA-1, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we show that GATA-1 binds a highly restricted upstream region of the approximately 70-kb GATA-2 domain, despite >80 GATA sites throughout the domain. GATA-2 also binds this region in the absence of GATA-1. Genetic complementation studies in GATA-1-null cells showed that GATA-1 rapidly displaces GATA-2, which is coupled to transcriptional repression. GATA-1 also displaces CREB-binding protein (CBP), despite the fact that GATA-1 binds CBP in other contexts. Repression correlates with reduced histone acetylation domain-wide, but not altered methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4. The GATA factor-binding region exhibited cell-type-specific enhancer activity in transient transfection assays. We propose that GATA-1 instigates GATA-2 repression by means of disruption of positive autoregulation, followed by establishment of a domain-wide repressive chromatin structure. Such a mechanism is predicted to be critical for the control of hematopoiesis.
7859831	Characterization of single-stranded DNA binding proteins in rat glial-enriched nuclei.	Single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs) are those proteins which preferentially bind single-stranded DNA as opposed to double-stranded DNA and are known to be involved in recombination, amplification, and repair of DNA. To characterize single-stranded DNA binding proteins of glial cells and to examine their potential involvement in induction of neurogenic tumors in rats, nuclei were isolated from target glia and non-target liver of carcinogenically sensitive Sprague-Dawley (SD) and resistant Berlin-Druckrey-IV (BD-IV) rats of various ages and rapidly proliferating glioma cells. Nuclei were fractionated into chromatin, a preribosomal RNA protein complex, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex (hnRNP), and nucleoplasm. SSBs were isolated, quantitated, and characterized by electrophoresis. A comparison of the contents of SSBs relative to RNA and their electrophoretic profiles between chromatin and hnRNP revealed that SSBs of liver chromatin were mainly associated with RNA. However, it was found that glial chromatin, particularly that of juvenile rats, was enriched with a heterogeneous series of SSBs which were not found in liver chromatin and presumably associated with chromosomal DNA. Some of these SSBs were enriched in glial chromatin of sensitive SD rats compared with that of resistant BD-IV rats. High mobility group proteins (HMG) 1 and 2 constituted major SSB components in the nucleoplasm and a greater amount of these HMGs were found in juvenile glia, compared to adult glia and juvenile and adult liver. Fractionation of glial SSBs and determination of their biological functions may contribute to the further understanding of the role these proteins may play in the processes of carcinogenesis.
9011864	[Complex-formation of phospholipase A2 with fragments of nucleic acids and approaches to its elimination].	Formation of phospholipase A2 stable complexes with nucleic acid fragments was observed upon the isolation of the enzyme from pig pancreas. This complex could be disrupted by neither DNA precipitation with protamine chloride and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide nor chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and CM-cellulose or hydroxyapatite. The treatment of the complexes with 1 M acetic acid followed by gel-chromatography on Sephadex G-75 in 1 M acetic acid resulted in complete separation of active phospholipase A2 from DNA fragments.
9461459	Distinctive patterns of histone H4 acetylation are associated with defined sequence elements within both heterochromatic and euchromatic regions of the human genome.	The pattern of histone H4 acetylation in different genomic regions has been investigated by immunoprecipitating oligonucleosomes from a human lymphoblastoid cell line with antibodies to H4 acetylated at lysines 5, 8, 12 or 16. DNA from antibody-bound or unbound chromatin was assayed by slot blotting. Pol I and pol II transcribed genes located in euchromatin were shown to have levels of H4 acetylation at lysines 5, 8 and 12 equivalent to those in input chromatin, but to be slightly enriched in H4 acetylated at lysine 16. In no case did the acetylation level correlate with actual or potential transcriptional activity. All acetylated histone H4 isoforms were depleted in non-coding, simple repeat DNA in heterochromatin, though the extent of depletion varied with the type of heterochromatin and with the isoform. Two single copy genes that map within or adjacent to blocks of paracentric heterochromatin are depleted in H4 acetylated at lysines 5, 8 and 12, but not 16. Consensus sequences of repetitive elements of the Alu family (SINES, enriched in R bands) were associated with H4 that was more highly acetylated at all four lysines than input chromatin, while H4 associated with Kpn I elements (LINES, enriched in G bands) was significantly underacetylated.
9733749	Human minichromosome maintenance proteins and human origin recognition complex 2 protein on chromatin.	Minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) proteins and the constituents of the origin recognition complex (Orc) are essential components of the eukaryotic replication initiation apparatus. Published evidence strongly suggests that the binding of Mcm proteins to chromatin is contingent upon the prior binding of Orc proteins. Here we use two different approaches to investigate the presence of the human ORC2 protein and of Mcm proteins on chromatin of HeLa cells in various cell cycle phases. First, we mobilized chromatin-bound proteins by micrococcal nuclease and analyzed the resulting digestion products by sucrose gradient centrifugations. Under digestion conditions when Mcm proteins were almost entirely released from chromatin, ORC2 protein was found to be associated with chromatin fragments containing several hundred base pairs of DNA. Second, we used an in vivo cross-linking procedure to covalently link Mcm proteins and ORC2 to DNA by short exposure of intact HeLa cells to formaldehyde. Specific immunoprecipitations revealed that cross-linked nucleoprotein fragments carried either Mcm proteins or ORC2 protein, but not both. Based on the lengths of the DNA fragments in immunoprecipitates, we estimate that the distance between chromatin-bound ORC2 protein and chromatin-bound Mcm proteins must be at least 500-1000 base pairs in HeLa cells.
11266453	A novel chromatin protein, distantly related to histone H2A, is largely excluded from the inactive X chromosome.	Chromatin on the mammalian inactive X chromosome differs in a number of ways from that on the active X. One protein, macroH2A, whose amino terminus is closely related to histone H2A, is enriched on the heterochromatic inactive X chromosome in female cells. Here, we report the identification and localization of a novel and more distant histone variant, designated H2A-Bbd, that is only 48% identical to histone H2A. In both interphase and metaphase female cells, using either a myc epitope-tagged or green fluorescent protein-tagged H2A-Bbd construct, the inactive X chromosome is markedly deficient in H2A-Bbd staining, while the active X and the autosomes stain throughout. In double-labeling experiments, antibodies to acetylated histone H4 show a pattern of staining indistinguishable from H2A-Bbd in interphase nuclei and on metaphase chromosomes. Chromatin fractionation demonstrates association of H2A-Bbd with the histone proteins. Separation of micrococcal nuclease-digested chromatin by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation shows cofractionation of H2A-Bbd with nucleosomes, supporting the idea that H2A-Bbd is incorporated into nucleosomes as a substitute for the core histone H2A. This finding, in combination with the overlap with acetylated forms of H4, raises the possibility that H2A-Bbd is enriched in nucleosomes associated with transcriptionally active regions of the genome. The distribution of H2A-Bbd thus distinguishes chromatin on the active and inactive X chromosomes.
11730344	A new analytical scale DNA affinity binding assay for analyses of specific protein-DNA interactions.	We describe a rapid analytical assay for identification of proteins binding to specific DNA sequences. The DAPSTER assay (DNA affinity preincubation specificity test of recognition assay) is a DNA affinity chromatography-based microassay that can discriminate between specific and nonspecific protein-DNA interactions. The assay is sensitive and can detect protein-DNA interactions and larger multicomponent complexes that can be missed by other analytical methods. Here we describe in detail the optimization and utilization of the DAPSTER assay to isolate AP-1 complexes and associated proteins in multimeric complexes bound to the AP-1 DNA element.
12000849	Combining chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA footprinting: a novel method to analyze protein-DNA interactions in vivo.	A variety of methods are available to analyze protein-DNA interactions in vivo. Two of the most prominent of these methods are chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and in vivo footprinting. Both of these procedures have specific limitations. For example, the ChIP assay fails to document where exactly a protein binds in vivo. The precipitation of a specific segment of DNA with antibodies directed against DNA-binding proteins does not necessarily indicate that the protein directly interacts with a sequence in the precipitate but could rather reflect protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, the results of in vivo footprinting studies are inconclusive if a DNA sequence is analyzed that is bound by a specific protein in only a certain fraction of cells. Finally, in vivo footprinting does not indicate which protein is bound at a specific site. We have developed a new procedure that combines the ChIP assay and DMS footprinting techniques. Using this method we show here that antibodies specific for USF1 and NF-E2 precipitate the murine beta-globin promoter in MEL cells. DMS footprinting analysis of the DNA precipitated with NF-E2 antibodies revealed a protection over a partial NF-E2-binding site in the beta-globin downstream promoter region. We believe that this novel method will generally benefit investigators interested in analyzing protein-DNA interactions in vivo.
12600448	Transcriptional activation of the enterocyte differentiation marker intestinal alkaline phosphatase is associated with changes in the acetylation state of histone H3 at a specific site within its promoter region in vitro.	Enterocyte differentiation is thought to occur through the transcriptional regulation of a small subset of specific genes. A recent growing body of evidence indicates that post-translational modifications of chromatin proteins (histones) play an important role in the control of gene transcription. Previous work has demonstrated that one such modification, histone acetylation, occurs in an in vitro model of enterocyte differentiation, butyrate-treated HT-29 cells. In the present work, we sought to determine if the epigenetic signal of histone acetylation occurs in an identifiable pattern in association with the transcriptional activation of the enterocyte differentiation marker gene intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP). HT-29 cells were maintained under standard culture conditions and differentiated with sodium butyrate. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was used to compare the acetylation state of histones associated with specific regions of the IAP promoter in the two cell populations (undifferentiated vs. differentiated). Chromatin was extracted from cells and cleaved by sonication or enzymatic digestion to obtain fragments of approximately 200 to 600 base-pairs, as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction using primers designed to amplify the IAP segments of interest. The ChIP assay selects DNA sequences that are associated with acetylated histones by immunoprecipitation. Unbound segments represent DNA sequences whose histones are not acetylated. After immunoprecipitation, sequences were detected by radiolabeled polymerase chain reaction, and the relative intensity of the bands was quantified by densitometry. The relative acetylation state of histones at specific sites was determined by comparing the ratios of bound/unbound segments. We determined that in a segment of the IAP promoter between -378 and -303 base-pairs upstream from the transcriptional start site, the acetylation state of histone H3 increased twofold in the differentiated, IAP expressing cells, whereas that of histone H4 remained essentially constant. Additionally, at a distant site, between -1378 and -1303 base-pairs, the acetylation state of H3 and H4 did not change appreciably between the undifferentiated and differentiated cells. We conclude that butyrate-induced differentiation is associated with specific and localized changes in the histone acetylation state within the IAP promoter. These changes within the endogenous IAP gene may underlie its transcriptional activation in the context of the enterocyte differentiation program.
12805369	The transcription factor CCAAT-binding factor CBF/NF-Y regulates the proximal promoter activity in the human alpha 1(XI) collagen gene (COL11A1).	We have characterized the proximal promoter region of the human COL11A1 gene. Transient transfection assays indicate that the segment from -199 to +1 is necessary for the activation of basal transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrated that the ATTGG sequence, within the -147 to -121 fragment, is critical to bind nuclear proteins in the proximal COL11A1 promoter. We demonstrated that the CCAAT binding factor (CBF/NF-Y) bound to this region using an interference assay with consensus oligonucleotides and a supershift assay with specific antibodies in an EMSA. In a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and EMSA using DNA-affinity-purified proteins, CBF/NF-Y proteins directly bound this region in vitro and in vivo. We also showed that four tandem copies of the CBF/NF-Y-binding fragment produced higher transcriptional activity than one or two copies, whereas the absence of a CBF/NF-Y-binding fragment suppressed the COL11A1 promoter activity. Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant-negative CBF-B/NF-YA subunit significantly inhibited promoter activity in both transient and stable cells. These results indicate that the CBF/NF-Y proteins regulate the transcription of COL11A1 by directly binding to the ATTGG sequence in the proximal promoter region.
8255779	Characterization of a multisubunit human protein which selectively binds single stranded d(GA)n and d(GT)n sequence repeats in DNA.	A protein which selectively binds d(GA)n and d(GT)n sequence repeats in single stranded DNA has been identified in human fibroblasts. This protein, designated PGB, has been purified at least 500-fold by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by DEAE-Sepharose column chromatography and affinity chromatography in a column of d(GA)-Sepharose. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that the PGB protein bound most avidly d(GA)n and d(GT)n tracts of n > 5. It also bound other G-rich DNA sequence repeats, including dGn tracts, with lower affinities. It did not manifest significant binding affinities to single stranded M13 DNA, or to the homopolynucleotides poly dA, poly dC and poly dT, or to various DNA sequence repeats which do not contain G residues, such as d(A-C)n and d(TC)n. It did not bind double stranded d(T-C)n.d(GA)n tracts or other double stranded DNA sequences. In glycerol gradient centrifugation assays the d(GA)n- and the d(GT)n-binding activities cosedimented as a homogeneous protein species having an S20,w = 9.4 +/- 0.7 and an estimated native molecular weight of 190,000 +/- 7,000. UV crosslinking assays revealed that the protein contains 33.6 +/- 2.1 kd subunits which bind d(GA)n and d(GT)n sequences. However, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified protein followed by silver staining indicated that it may also contain other subunits that do not contact the DNA. It is proposed that binding of the PGB protein to single stranded d(GA)n or d(GT)n tracts in double stranded topologically restricted DNA may stimulate strand separation and formation of triple helices or other unusual DNA structures.
9115430	Chromatin proteins involved in the initiation of DNA replication.	Eukaryotic DNA replication is regulated at least in part by the assembly of initiation proteins onto origins of replication. The origin recognition complex (ORC) is bound to origins throughout most of the cell cycle. Other initiation proteins, such as Cdc6 and the MCM/P1 proteins, are assembled onto ORC-containing chromatin during G1 to define a prereplicative complex. During S phase, these proteins are displaced from chromatin and their reassembly is inhibited by protein-dependent kinases.
10751148	Large-scale chromatin organization of the major histocompatibility complex and other regions of human chromosome 6 and its response to interferon in interphase nuclei.	The large-scale chromatin organization of the major histocompatibility complex and other regions of chromosome 6 was studied by three-dimensional image analysis in human cell types with major differences in transcriptional activity. Entire gene clusters were visualized by fluorescence in situ hybridization with multiple locus-specific probes. Individual genomic regions showed distinct configurations in relation to the chromosome 6 terrritory. Large chromatin loops containing several megabases of DNA were observed extending outwards from the surface of the domain defined by the specific chromosome 6 paint. The frequency with which a genomic region was observed on an external chromatin loop was cell type dependent and appeared to be related to the number of active genes in that region. Transcriptional up-regulation of genes in the major histocompatibility complex by interferon-gamma led to an increase in the frequency with which this large gene cluster was found on an external chromatin loop. Our data are consistent with an association between large-scale chromatin organization of specific genomic regions and their transcriptional status.
10882726	Heterochromatin protein 1 binds to nucleosomes and DNA in vitro.	Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) is a nonhistone chromosomal protein primarily associated with the pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres in Drosophila. The molecular mechanism by which HP1 specifically recognizes and binds to chromatin is unknown. The purpose of this study was to test whether HP1 can bind directly to nucleosomes. HP1 binds nucleosome core particles and naked DNA. HP1-DNA complex formation is length-dependent and cooperative but relatively sequence-independent. We show that histone H4 amino-terminal peptides bind to monomeric and dimeric HP1 in vitro. Acetylation of lysine residues had no significant effect on in vitro binding. The C-terminal chromo shadow domain of HP1 specifically binds H4 N-terminal peptide. Neither the chromo domain nor chromo shadow domain alone binds DNA; intact native HP1 is required for such interactions. Together, these observations suggest that HP1 may serve as a cross-linker in chromatin, linking nucleosomal DNA and nonhistone protein complexes to form higher order chromatin structures.
11006266	XIST RNA associates with specific regions of the inactive X chromatin.	Microscopy studies have shown that XIST RNA colocalizes with the inactive X chromosome (Xi). However, the molecular basis for this colocalization is unknown. Here we provide two lines of evidence from chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments that XIST RNA physically associates with the Xi chromatin. First, XIST RNA can be co-precipitated by antiserum against macroH2A, a histone H2A variant enriched in the Xi. Second, XIST RNA can be co-precipitated by antisera that recognize unacetylated, but not acetylated, isoforms of histones H3 and H4. The specificity of XIST RNA association with hypoacetylated chromatin, together with the previous finding that hypoacetylated histone H4 is enriched at promoters of X-inactivated genes, raises the possibility that XIST RNA may contribute to the hypoacetylation of specific regions of the Xi so as to alter the expression of X-linked genes.
11571307	Transcription factor FoxA (HNF3) on a nucleosome at an enhancer complex in liver chromatin.	Nucleosome-like particles and acetylated histones occur near active promoters and enhancers, and certain transcription factors can recognize their target sites on the surface of a nucleosome in vitro; yet it has been unclear whether transcription factors can occupy target sites on nucleosomes in native chromatin. We developed a method for sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation of distinct nuclear proteins that are simultaneously cross-linked to nucleosome-sized genomic DNA segments. We find that core histone H2A co-occupies, along with the FoxA (hepatocyte nuclear factor-3) transcription factor, DNA for the albumin transcriptional enhancer in native liver chromatin, where the enhancer is active. Because histone H2A on nuclear DNA is only known to exist in nucleosomes, we conclude that transcription factors can form a stable complex on nucleosomes at an active enhancer element in vivo.
12101404	An algorithm for finding protein-DNA binding sites with applications to chromatin-immunoprecipitation microarray experiments.	Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by cDNA microarray hybridization (ChIP-array) has become a popular procedure for studying genome-wide protein-DNA interactions and transcription regulation. However, it can only map the probable protein-DNA interaction loci within 1-2 kilobases resolution. To pinpoint interaction sites down to the base-pair level, we introduce a computational method, Motif Discovery scan (MDscan), that examines the ChIP-array-selected sequences and searches for DNA sequence motifs representing the protein-DNA interaction sites. MDscan combines the advantages of two widely adopted motif search strategies, word enumeration and position-specific weight matrix updating, and incorporates the ChIP-array ranking information to accelerate searches and enhance their success rates. MDscan correctly identified all the experimentally verified motifs from published ChIP-array experiments in yeast (STE12, GAL4, RAP1, SCB, MCB, MCM1, SFF, and SWI5), and predicted two motif patterns for the differential binding of Rap1 protein in telomere regions. In our studies, the method was faster and more accurate than several established motif-finding algorithms. MDscan can be used to find DNA motifs not only in ChIP-array experiments but also in other experiments in which a subgroup of the sequences can be inferred to contain relatively abundant motif sites. The MDscan web server can be accessed at http://BioProspector.stanford.edu/MDscan/.
12789273	Global transcriptional program of p53 target genes during the process of apoptosis and cell cycle progression.	The temporal gene expression profile during the entire process of apoptosis and cell cycle progression in response to p53 in human ovarian cancer cells was explored with cDNA microarrays representing 33 615 individual human genes. A total of 1501 genes (4.4%) were found to respond to p53 (approximately 80% of these were repressed by p53) using 2.5-fold change as a cutoff. It was anticipated that most of p53 responsive genes resulted from the secondary effect of p53 expression at late stage of apoptosis. To delineate potential p53 direct and indirect target genes during the process of apoptosis and cell cycle progression, microarray data were combined with global p53 DNA-binding site analysis. Here we showed that 361 out of 1501 p53 responsive genes contained p53 consensus DNA-binding sequence(s) in their regulatory region, approximately 80% of which were repressed by p53. This is the first time that a large number of p53-repressed genes have been identified to contain p53 consensus DNA-binding sequence(s) in their regulatory region. Hierarchical cluster analysis of these genes revealed distinct temporal expression patterns of transcriptional activation and repression by p53. More genes were activated at early time points, while more repressed genes were found after the onset of apoptosis. A small-scale quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that in vivo p53-DNA interaction was detected in eight out of 10 genes, most of which were repressed by p53 at the early onset of apoptosis, suggesting that a portion of p53 target genes in the human genome could be negatively regulated by p53 via sequence-specific DNA binding. The approaches and genes described here should aid the understanding of global gene regulatory network of p53.
14521963	A comprehensive search for HNF-3alpha-regulated genes in mouse hepatoma cells by 60K cDNA microarray and chromatin immunoprecipitation/PCR analysis.	To characterize the regulatory pattern by a specific transcription regulatory factor, we used a combination of expression analysis with the mouse cDNA microarray composed of 60,000 cDNA clones and cross-linking/chromatin immunoprecipitation (X-ChIP) followed by comparative PCR. Overexpression of mouse hepatocyte nuclear factor-3alpha (HNF-3alpha) in a mouse hepatoma cell line resulted in accompanied perturbed expression of more than 1500 genes. Search for HNF-3alpha consensus recognition sequences in the upstream regions of their coding sequences, which were mapped on the mouse genome, enabled us to mine 300 genes as the potential HNF-3alpha-regulated genes and classify 135 annotated ones into several functional categories. Further X-ChIP/PCR analysis demonstrated in vivo binding of HNF-3alpha to the 5(')-flanking sequences of 25 members selected out of these genes. Besides known HNF-3alpha-regulated genes such as albumin and alpha-fetoprotein genes, the genes newly identified as the HNF-3alpha-regulated ones include three encoding CDP-diacylglycerol-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase, phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, and phospholipase A2, which are located en suite in the lipid metabolic pathway in liver. The potential usefulness of the present approach to extensive characterization of gene expression framework directed by a specific transcription regulatory factor is discussed.
10541550	Drosophila ORC specifically binds to ACE3, an origin of DNA replication control element.	In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sequence-specific DNA binding by the origin recognition complex (ORC) is responsible for selecting origins of DNA replication. In metazoans, origin selection is poorly understood and it is unknown whether specific DNA binding by metazoan ORC controls replication. To address this problem, we used in vivo and in vitro approaches to demonstrate that Drosophila ORC (DmORC) binds to replication elements that direct repeated initiation of replication to amplify the Drosophila chorion gene loci in the follicle cells of egg chambers. Using immunolocalization, we observe that ACE3, a 440-bp chorion element that contains information sufficient to drive amplification, directs DmORC localization in follicle cells. Similarly, in vivo cross-linking and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate association of DmORC with both ACE3 and two other amplification control elements, AER-d and ACE1. To demonstrate that the in vivo localization of DmORC is related to its DNA-binding properties, we find that purified DmORC binds to ACE3 and AER-d in vitro, and like its S. cerevisiae counterpart, this binding is dependent on ATP. Our findings suggest that sequence-specific DNA binding by ORC regulates initiation of metazoan DNA replication. Furthermore, adaptation of this experimental approach will allow for the identification of additional metazoan ORC DNA-binding sites and potentially origins of replication.
11745577	Hydroxyapatite coating on titanium by thermal substrate method in aqueous solution.	A new hydrocoating method (the thermal substrate method) is proposed for coating calcium phosphates such as hydroxyapatite (HA), on titanium substrates in an aqueous solution. Several factors (e.g., the type of ion source, the heating time and temperature, and the surface roughness of the substrate) affected the characteristics of the precipitate formed by this method. The solution used included 3 mmol dm(-3) Ca(H(2)PO(4))(2) and 7 mmol dm(-3) CaCl(2), and its pH was adjusted to 6.5. The experimental studies were conducted under the following conditions: temperature 45-160 degrees C, heating time 10-20 min, and surface roughness of substrate #120-#2000 grid ground using energy paper. A high quality of precipitate, whose predominant component was HA, was obtained on titanium substrates by the thermal substrate method in an aqueous solution. No significant difference in the precipitates was found with the type of ion source. The amount of HA precipitate increased with increasing temperature and with increasing heating time. The features of the precipitate were different, depending on the surface roughtness of the substrate: HA regularly nucleated along the grooves of the rough surface (#120 and #400 grid), and in the case of the fine surface (#1200-#2000 grid), a uniform precipitation occurred.
11981037	DNA binding-independent induction of IkappaBalpha gene transcription by PPARalpha.	PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate energy homeostasis. In addition, PPARs furthermore control the inflammatory response by antagonizing the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway. We recently demonstrated that PPARalpha activators increase IkappaBalpha mRNA and protein levels in human aortic smooth muscle cells. Here, we studied the molecular mechanisms by which PPARalpha controls IkappaBalpha expression. Using transient transfection assays, it is demonstrated that PPARalpha potentiates p65-stimulated IkappaBalpha transcription in a ligand-dependent manner. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that PPARalpha activation of IkappaBalpha transcription requires the NF-kappaB and Sp1 sites within IkappaBalpha promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that PPARalpha activation enhances the occupancy of the NF-kappaB response element in IkappaBalpha promoter in vivo. Overexpression of the oncoprotein E1A failed to inhibit PPARalpha-mediated IkappaBalpha promoter induction, suggesting that cAMP response element binding protein-binding protein/p300 is not involved in this mechanism. By contrast, a dominant-negative form of VDR-interacting protein 205 (DRIP205) comprising its two LXXLL motifs completely abolished PPARalpha ligand-mediated activation. Furthermore, cotransfection of increasing amounts of DRIP205 relieved this inhibition, suggesting that PPARalpha requires DRIP205 to regulate IkappaBalpha promoter activity. By contrast, DRIP205 is not involved in PPARalpha-mediated NF-kappaB transcriptional repression. Taken together, these data provide a molecular basis for PPARalpha-mediated induction of IkappaBalpha and demonstrate, for the first time, that PPARalpha may positively regulate gene transcription in the absence of functional PPAR response elements.
12419248	Deciphering the transcriptional histone acetylation code for a human gene.	We report the results of experiments designed to test the histone code hypothesis. We found that only a small subset of lysines in histones H4 and H3 are acetylated in vivo by the GCN5 acetyltransferase during activation of the IFN-beta gene. Reconstitution of recombinant nucleosomes bearing mutations in these lysine residues revealed the cascade of gene activation via a point-by-point interpretation of the histone code through the ordered recruitment of bromodomain-containing transcription complexes. Acetylation of histone H4 K8 mediates recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex whereas acetylation of K9 and K14 in histone H3 is critical for the recruitment of TFIID. Thus, the information contained in the DNA address of the enhancer is transferred to the histone N termini by generating novel adhesive surfaces required for the recruitment of transcription complexes.
12522000	Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies indicate a role for CCAAT enhancer binding proteins alpha and epsilon (C/EBP alpha and C/EBP epsilon ) and CDP/cut in myeloid maturation-induced lactoferrin gene expression.	In vitro models of granulopoiesis involving the inducible expression of either CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha) or C/EBP epsilon in myeloid cells have been shown to lead to the induction of a granulocytic maturation program accompanied by the expression of myeloid-specific genes. Since members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors recognize and bind to similar DNA-binding motifs, it has been difficult to elucidate the specific role of each of the C/EBP family members in eliciting myeloid gene expression. In order to address this issue, we focused on the expression of the lactoferrin (LF) gene. LF expression is transcriptionally regulated in a C/EBP-dependent manner in myeloid cells. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis we demonstrate that C/EBP alpha binds to the LF promoter in nonexpressing cells. Upon induction of maturation, C/EBP epsilon binds to the LF promoter, which correlates with LF expression. Lack of LF expression in the acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4, which harbors the t(15;17) translocation, cannot be correlated with aberrant binding at the C/EBP site in the LF promoter. It is, however, associated with the persistent binding of the silencer CCAAT displacement protein (CDP/cut) to the LF promoter in these cells. We conclude that C/EBP alpha, C/EBP epsilon, and CDP/cut all play definitive roles in regulating late gene expression during normal myeloid development.
12766778	Differential regulation of E2F1 apoptotic target genes in response to DNA damage.	E2F1, a member of the E2F family of transcription factors, in addition to its established proliferative effect, has also been implicated in the induction of apoptosis through p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways. Several genes involved in the activation or execution of the apoptotic programme have recently been shown to be upregulated at the transcriptional level by E2F1 overexpression, including the genes encoding INK4a/ARF, Apaf-1, caspase 7 and p73 (refs 3-5). E2F1 is stabilized in response to DNA damage but it has not been established how this translates into the activation of specific subsets of E2F target genes. Here, we applied a chromatin immunoprecipitation approach to show that, in response to DNA damage, E2F1 is directed from cell cycle progression to apoptotic E2F target genes. We identify p73 as an important E2F1 apoptotic target gene in DNA damage response and we show that acetylation is required for E2F1 recruitment on the P1p73 promoter and for its transcriptional activation.
12887906	In vivo roles of Rad52, Rad54, and Rad55 proteins in Rad51-mediated recombination.	Repairing a double-strand break by homologous recombination requires binding of the strand exchange protein Rad51p to ssDNA, followed by synapsis with a homologous donor. Here we used chromatin immunoprecipitation to monitor the in vivo association of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51p with both the cleaved MATa locus and the HML alpha donor. Localization of Rad51p to MAT precedes its association with HML, providing evidence of the time needed for the Rad51 filament to search the genome for a homologous sequence. Rad51p binding to ssDNA requires Rad52p. The absence of Rad55p delays Rad51p binding to ssDNA and prevents strand invasion and localization of Rad51p to HML alpha. Lack of Rad54p does not significantly impair Rad51p recruitment to MAT or its initial association with HML alpha; however, Rad54p is required at or before the initiation of DNA synthesis after synapsis has occurred at the 3' end of the invading strand.
7919585	Experience from experimental models in the quest to protect myocardium from ischemic damage: update on preconditioning strategies.	Protection of the myocardium during ischemia is a primary target of basic research in cardiology. Ischemic preconditioning has consistently been shown to reduce myocardial damage substantially, but for clinical application, other ways of preconditioning the heart must be found. In the search for the mechanism of ischemic preconditioning, pharmacologic and physiologic interventions that mimic ischemic preconditioning have been evaluated in various animal models. This review surveys the findings of some of these studies.
8993035	UV-laser crosslinking of proteins to DNA.	Photochemical crosslinking is now a powerful method for studying protein-nucleic acid interactions. UV light is a zero-length crosslinking agent that predominantly or exclusively crosslinks proteins to nucleic acids at their contact points. It can therefore provide strong evidence for close protein-nucleic acid interactions. However, to achieve an acceptable degree of crosslinking with conventional UV light sources, exposure times ranging from minutes to several hours are necessary. Such prolonged irradiation allows for the artifactual redistribution of proteins and precludes kinetic studies. The use of UV lasers overcomes these difficulties since the number of photons required for the crosslinking may be delivered in time intervals on the order of nano- or even picoseconds. We described detailed procedures for UV laser-induced protein-DNA crosslinking both in vivo and in vitro. Technical aspects, including the choice of UV laser for irradiation, the isolation of covalently crosslinked protein-DNA complexes, immunochemical techniques for both the identification and isolation of specific protein-DNA complexes and the identification of the crosslinked DNA sequences, are reviewed in detail. The application of UV laser crosslinking in kinetic studies is illustrated by the example of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) interaction with the adenovirus E4 promoter.
9449338	Precipitation of DNA by polyamines: a polyelectrolyte behavior.	"Conditions of double-stranded DNA precipitation by the polyamines spermidine and spermine have been determined experimentally and compared to theoretical predictions. The influence of the concentrations of DNA and added monovalent salt, and of the DNA length has been investigated in a systematic manner. Three regimes of DNA concentrations are observed. We clarify the dependence of these regimes on the monovalent salt concentration and on the DNA length. Our observations make possible a rationalization of the experimental results reported in the literature. A comparison of the precipitation conditions of different kinds of polyelectrolytes suggests a general process. Our experimental data are compared to the ""ion-bridging"" model based on short-range electrostatic attractions. By starting from the spinodal equation, predicted by this model, and using the limiting form of Manning's fractions of condensed counterions, analytical expressions of the precipitation conditions have been found in the three regimes. Experimental and theoretical results are in good agreement."
10190109	[Development of a method for alkaline extraction of DNA from Brucella for diagnosing brucellosis using the polymerase chain reaction].	Several methods of alkaline extraction of chromosome DNA from Brucella in the presence of 50 microliters model diagnostic material blood serum are developed for the diagnosis of brucellosis by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These methods are based on the capacity of NaOH to effectively denature proteins and destroy Brucella cell wall, thus isolating the genome DNA without exposure to proteolytic enzymes, detergents, deproteinization, or pH neutralization. The first method consists in alkaline lysis by 0.2-1.0 M NaOH followed by DNA precipitation with two ethanol volumes in the presence of 0.1 M NaCl, washing of the resultant precipitate in 80% ethanol, drying of the precipitate, and dissolving in distilled water. The second method includes alkaline lysis in the presence of 0.3 M NaCl with NaOH concentrations of 0.5-4.3 M and the stages of DNA sedimentation, washing of precipitate, its drying and dissolving similar to those in alkaline lysis. The third method consists in alkaline lysis-precipitation by 0.2-05 M NaOH in the presence of 0.1 M NaCl and 64% ethanol, followed by DNA preparation stages similar to those in alkaline lysis. The best results were achieved by alkaline lysis in the presence of 0.3 M NaCl at NaOH concentrations of 0.7 and 2.1 M, which meant theoretical levels of sensitivity 140 and 86 Brucella cells, respectively.
10619601	A method for efficient extraction of bovine papilloma virus-based minichromosomes that preserves native chromatin structure.	Aiming to create an adequate model for investigation of the molecular mechanisms involved in transcriptional regulation by steroid hormones, a number of cell lines carrying bovine papilloma virus (BPV) based constructs containing the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat (LTR) were established (Ostrowski et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 3, 2945-2957, 1983). However, all our attempts to extract from the cells such minichromosomes as nucleoprotein complexes using a method previously described (Ostrowski, Nucleic Acids Res. 15, 6957-6971, 1987) failed. Here, we show that this failure was attributable to DNA rearrangements in most of the cell lines, resulting in the integration of the BPV-based constructs into the host cell genome. We have identified two cell lines where the constructs are episomal. Micrococcal nuclease digestion of the nuclei demonstrated the presence of nucleosomes positioned over the episomal MMTV LTR. We managed to optimize conditions for preparation of nuclei and minichromosomes, which allowed extraction of approximately 40% of the minichromosomes, most of them being in circular superhelical form. Our data show clearly that the main factor preventing the release of minichromosomes from the nuclei is the presence of polyamines in the cell lysis buffer. The organization of MMTV promoter chromatin was unaffected by the extraction procedure, suggesting that these minichromosomes could be valuable templates for in vitro transcription studies and to identify proteins involved in chromatin remodeling during transcription.
10888617	Evidence for nucleic acid binding ability and nucleosome association of Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus BRO proteins.	The Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) genome contains five related members of the bro gene family, all of which are actively expressed in infected BmN cells. Although their functions are unknown, their amino acid sequences contain a motif found in all known viral and prokaryotic single-stranded DNA binding proteins. To determine if they bind to nucleic acids, we fractionated the nuclei of BmNPV-infected BmN cells using a histone extraction protocol. We detected BRO-A, BRO-C, and BRO-D in the histone H1 fraction using anti-BRO antibodies. Micrococcal nuclease treatment released these BRO proteins from the chromatin fraction, suggesting their involvement in nucleosome structures. Chromatographic fractionation showed that BRO-A and/or BRO-C interacted with core histones. Expression of partial sequences of BRO-A proved that the N-terminal 80 amino acid residues were required for DNA binding activity. We also demonstrated that BmNPV BRO proteins underwent phosphorylation and ubiquitination followed by proteasome degradation, which may explain their distribution in the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus. We propose that BRO-A and BRO-C may function as DNA binding proteins that influence host DNA replication and/or transcription.
11113195	Matrix attachment region-dependent function of the immunoglobulin mu enhancer involves histone acetylation at a distance without changes in enhancer occupancy.	Nuclear matrix attachment regions (MARs), which flank the immunoglobulin mu heavy-chain enhancer on either side, are required for the activation of the distal variable-region (V(H)) promoter in transgenic mice. Previously, we have shown that the MARs extend a local domain of chromatin accessibility at the mu enhancer to more distal sites. In this report, we examine the influence of MARs on the formation of a nucleoprotein complex at the enhancer and on the acetylation of histones, which have both been implicated in contributing to chromatin accessibility. By in vivo footprint analysis of transgenic mu gene constructs, we show that the occupancy of factor-binding sites at the mu enhancer is similar in transcriptionally active wild-type and transcriptionally inactive DeltaMAR genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicate, however, that the acetylation of histones at enhancer-distal nucleosomes is enhanced 10-fold in the presence of MARs, whereas the levels of histone acetylation at enhancer-proximal nucleosomes are similar for wild-type and DeltaMAR genes. Taken together, these data indicate that the function of MARs in mediating long-range chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activation of the V(H) promoter involves the generation of an extended domain of histone acetylation, independent of changes in the occupancy of the mu enhancer.
12198165	The chromatin remodeling complex NoRC targets HDAC1 to the ribosomal gene promoter and represses RNA polymerase I transcription.	Mammalian chromatin remodeling complexes are involved in both activation and repression of transcription. Here, we show that NoRC, a SNF2h- containing nucleolar chromatin remodeling complex, represses ribosomal gene transcription. NoRC-mediated rDNA silencing was alleviated by trichostatin A, indicating that histone deacetylation is causally involved in silencing. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that overexpression of TIP5, the large subunit of NoRC, mediates deacetylation of nucleosomes in the vicinity of the rDNA promoter. Protein-protein interaction assays reveal association of TIP5 with the histone deacetylase HDAC1 in vivo and in vitro. Deletion of the C-terminal PHD finger and bromodomain abolishes the interaction of TIP5 and HDAC1, and abrogates transcriptional repression. The results suggest that NoRC silences the rDNA locus by targeting the SIN3 corepressor complex to the rDNA promoter, thereby establishing a repressed chromatin structure.
12626549	The cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate response element modulator suppresses IL-2 production in stimulated T cells by a chromatin-dependent mechanism.	The production of IL-2 is tightly controlled by several transcription factors that bind to the IL-2 promoter. The cAMP response element modulator (CREM) is known to form complexes with CREB and bind to the -180 site of the IL-2 promoter in anergic and in systemic lupus erythematosus T cells. In this study we show that CREM is transcriptionally induced in T cells following stimulation through CD3 and CD28, binds to the IL-2 promoter in vivo, and suppresses IL-2 production. Transfection of an antisense CREM plasmid into T cells blocked the expression and binding of CREM to the IL-2 promoter and the decrease of IL-2 production, which follows the early increase after T cell stimulation with CD3 and CD28. In addition, as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, antisense CREM prevented the binding of protein 300 and cAMP response element binding protein and promoted the acetylation of histones. Antisense CREM also enhanced the accessibility of the IL-2 promoter to endonucleases and prevented the condensation of chromatin in vivo. Our data suggest that upon T cell activation, CREM gradually replaces phosphorylated CREB at the -180 site of the IL-2 promoter. CREM, in turn, binds protein 300 and cAMP response element binding protein, but CREM is unable to activate its histone acetyltransferase activity, which results in condensation of chromatin and down-regulation of IL-2 production.
12740381	Protein kinase A-anchoring protein AKAP95 interacts with MCM2, a regulator of DNA replication.	Protein kinase A (PKA)-anchoring protein AKAP95 is localized to the nucleus in interphase, where it primarily associates with the nuclear matrix. A yeast two-hybrid screen for AKAP95 interaction partners identified the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) 2 protein, a component of the pre-replication complex. AKAP95-MCM2 interaction was mapped to residues 1-195 of AKAP95 and corroborated by glutathione S-transferase precipitation and immunoprecipitation from chromatin. Disruption of AKAP95-MCM2 interaction with an AKAP95-(1-195) peptide within HeLa cell nuclei abolishes initiation of DNA replication in G1 phase and the elongation phase of replication in vitro without affecting global nuclear organization or import. Disruption of the C-terminal zinc finger of AKAP95 reduces efficiency of replication initiation. Disruption of the PKA-binding domain does not impair replication in G1- or S-phase nuclei, whereas a PKA inhibitor affects the initiation but not the elongation phase of replication. Depleting AKAP95 from nuclei partially depletes MCM2 and abolishes replication. Recombinant AKAP95 restores intranuclear MCM2 and replication in a dose-dependent manner. Our results suggest a role of AKAP95 in DNA replication by providing a scaffold for MCM2.
7765058	Extension of incomplete cDNAs (ESTs) by biotin/streptavidin-mediated walking using the polymerase chain reaction.	In the last 2 years thousands of new partial cDNAs or expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have been identified by single pass sequencing methods. It is expected that this number will further increase in order to help to isolate all human genes. However, the scientific value of partial cDNA fragments is limited unless they are used as tools for isolating and sequencing their full length parent molecules. Conventional library screening methods are tedious and not very effective in achieving this goal. We present a modified PCR technique which allows rapid isolation of the ends of partial cDNA fragments in vitro using a biotin/streptavidin capture procedure. Our method has several advantages over the RACE technique, is very specific, and allows to frequently sequence the final product directly without subcloning. We also show that cDNA walks can be obtained from partial sequences as short as 26 bp.
9547290	A recombination based method to rapidly assess specificity of two-hybrid clones in yeast.	The yeast two-hybrid system is frequently used to identify protein-protein interactions. Confirming the specificity of candidate clones requires separation and isolation of yeast plasmids, propagation in bacteria and testing combinations of DNA-binding and activation domain hybrids in yeast. In order to simplify this procedure, we developed a rapid method based on PCR amplification of library insert DNAs and in vivo cloning into the activation domain hybrid vector. Reporter gene activity is assayed in parallel for combinations with different DNA-binding domain hybrids. Further characterization of inserts does not require plasmid isolation and intermediate hosts.
10574969	Histone deacetylase inhibition selectively alters the activity and expression of cell cycle proteins leading to specific chromatin acetylation and antiproliferative effects.	Histone acetylation is emerging as a major regulatory mechanism thought to modulate gene expression by altering the accessibility of transcription factors to DNA. In this study, treatment of human tumor cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trapoxin (TPX), resulted in selective changes in genes that control the cell cycle. TPX activated p21(waf1) transcription that led to elevated p21(waf1) protein levels in three human tumor cell lines without altering the protein levels of cdk2, cdk4, or cyclin B. In addition, TPX increased cyclin E transcription without increasing the levels of Rb, E2F, dihydrofolate reductase, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The elevated levels of p21(waf1) protein led to decreased Rb phosphorylation and cdk2 activity. These effects resulted in G(1) and G(2) cell cycle arrest in H1299 human lung and MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells and apoptosis in A549 lung carcinoma cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that TPX increased the level of chromatin acetylation associated with histone H3 in the trapoxin-responsive region of the p21(waf1) promoter. This study demonstrates that inhibition of HDAC by TPX increases acetylation of H3-associated chromatin and alters gene expression with marked selectivity.
11179222	The budding yeast proteins Spc24p and Spc25p interact with Ndc80p and Nuf2p at the kinetochore and are important for kinetochore clustering and checkpoint control.	Here, we show that the budding yeast proteins Ndc80p, Nuf2p, Spc24p and Spc25p interact at the kinetochore. Consistently, Ndc80p, Nuf2p, Spc24p and Spc25p associate with centromere DNA in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, and SPC24 interacts genetically with MCM21 encoding a kinetochore component. Moreover, although conditional lethal spc24-2 and spc25-7 cells form a mitotic spindle, the kinetochores remain in the mother cell body and fail to segregate the chromosomes. Despite this defect in chromosome segregation, spc24-2 and spc25-7 cells do not arrest in metaphase in response to checkpoint control. Furthermore, spc24-2 cells showed a mitotic checkpoint defect when microtubules were depolymerized with nocodazole, indicating that Spc24p has a function in checkpoint control. Since Ndc80p, Nuf2p and Spc24p are conserved proteins, it is likely that similar complexes are part of the kinetochore in other organisms.
11272471	Control of chromatin remodeling.	Chromatin structure has a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression. Transcriptional activation or the repression of a gene require the recruitment of multiple chromatin remodeling complexes. Chromatin remodeling complexes modulate the higher order structure of chromatin, facilitate or hinder the binding of transcription factors, and aid in or prevent the establishment of a transcriptional preinitiation complex. Two types of chromatin remodeling complexes have been extensively studied--ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes and histone-modifying enzymes--which include histone acetyltransferases, histone deacetylases, and histone kinases. Transcriptional activators and repressors are responsible for recruitment of one or more of these large, multisubunit chromatin remodeling complexes. In this review, the features of the chromatin remodeling complexes and the modes of their recruitment are presented.
11511539	Binding of c-Myc to chromatin mediates mitogen-induced acetylation of histone H4 and gene activation.	The Myc protein binds DNA and activates transcription by mechanisms that are still unclear. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to evaluate Myc-dependent changes in histone acetylation at seven target loci. Upon serum stimulation of Rat1 fibroblasts, Myc associated with chromatin, histone H4 became locally hyperacetylated, and gene expression was induced. These responses were lost or severely impaired in Myc-deficient cells, but were restored by adenoviral delivery of Myc simultaneous with mitogenic stimulation. When targeted to chromatin in the absence of mitogens, Myc directly induced H4 acetylation. In addition, Myc recruited TRRAP to chromatin, consistent with a role for this cofactor in histone acetylation. Finally, unlike serum, Myc alone was very inefficient in inducing expression of most target genes. Myc therefore governs a step, most likely H4 acetylation, that is required but not sufficient for transcriptional activation. We propose that Myc acts as a permissive factor, allowing additional signals to activate target promoters.
12237417	A DNA vaccine containing an infectious Marek's disease virus genome can confer protection against tumorigenic Marek's disease in chickens.	A DNA vaccine containing the infectious BAC20 clone of serotype 1 Marek's disease virus (MDV) was tested for its potential to protect against Marek's disease (MD). Chickens were immunized at 1 day old with BAC20 DNA suspended either in PBS, as calcium phosphate precipitates, incorporated into chitosan nanoparticles, in Escherichia coli DH10B cells, or bound to gold particles for gene-gun delivery. Challenge infection with MDV strain EU1 was performed at 12 days old, and four out of seven birds immunized with BAC20 DNA in saline by the intramuscular route remained free of MD until day 77 after challenge infection. A delay in the development of the disease could be observed in some animals vaccinated with other BAC20 DNA formulations, but clinical MD and tumour formation were evident in all but one bird. Five out of seven animals immunized with the vaccine virus CVI988 were protected against MD, but none out of seven birds survived EU1 challenge infection after injection of negative-control plasmid DNA. In a second animal experiment, five out of 12 chickens immunized with BAC20 DNA and six out of eight birds immunized with virus reconstituted from BAC20 DNA remained free of MD after challenge infection. In contrast, none out of 12 chickens survived challenge infection after immunization with BAC20 DNA lacking the essential gE gene or with gE-negative BAC20 virus. The results suggested that an MDV BAC DNA vaccine has potential to protect chickens against MD, but that in vivo reconstitution of vaccine virus is a prerequisite for protection.
12821939	v-Jun downregulates the SPARC target gene by binding to the proximal promoter indirectly through Sp1/3.	Transformation of chick embryo fibroblasts by the v-Jun oncoprotein correlates with a downregulation of the extracellular matrix protein SPARC and repression of the corresponding mRNA. Repression of SPARC contributes to the oncogenic process by facilitating tumor development in vivo. A proximal promoter fragment, designated -124/+16, is responsible for high constitutive activity of the SPARC gene and is the target of repression by v-Jun. In this paper, using electrophoretic mobility shift and pull-down assays in vitro, and transient transfections and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in Sp1/3-deficient Drosophila SL2 cells and in chick embryo fibroblasts, we show that (i) Sp1 and/or Sp3 is required for constitutive activation of SPARC transcription, by binding directly to the GGA-rich -92/-57 fragment; and (ii) v-Jun does not bind -124/+16 directly, but binds to the GGA-rich fragment indirectly, most likely through a physical interaction with Sp1/3. Moreover, a transactivation-proficient v-Jun derivative, designated v-Jun/cebp/glz, which cannot bind Jun DNA motifs anymore and cannot heterodimerize, is still capable of downregulating SPARC efficiently. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that v-Jun downregulates SPARC through the formation of a DNA-Sp1/3-v-Jun, chromatin-associated complex.
9610644	Sequence and immunogenicity of the Taenia saginata homologue of the major surface antigen of Echinococcus spp.	A clone (R-Tso18) was isolated from a Taenia saginata oncosphere cDNA library by screening with sera from rabbits immunised with oncosphere extract. It contained a full-length cDNA sequence of 1893 bp with an open reading frame of 1680 bp, corresponding to 559 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 65.173 kDa and an isoelectric point of 6.08. The R-Tso18 protein showed 80-84% nucleotide identity with the major protoscolex surface antigens of Echinococcus multilocularis (EM10) and E. granulosus (EG10). Preliminary immunogenicity studies employing the radiolabeled R-Tso18 protein in immune co-precipitation assays indicated sero-positivity for T. saginata-infected calf sera (6/13), T. solium cysticercosis human (7/22) and pig (2/2) sera and E. multilocularis (6/10)- and E. granulosus (1/12)-infected human sera, whereas other helminth-infection sera were negative. As immuno-precipitation is a relatively insensitive assay, it was concluded that further studies on the diagnostic potential of the purified recombinant R-Tso18 antigen, or its peptides, are merited.
9817169	Expression of p53, p21 (Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1) and Fas antigen in collagen vascular and granulomatous lung diseases.	Fas is expressed in various cells and transduces the cell death signal. p21 is a mediator of p53-dependent G1 arrest associated with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage. The upregulation of p53 and p21 associated with DNA damage in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has been described previously. In this study, p53, p21, and Fas expression and DNA damage were examined in interstitial pneumonia associated with collagen vascular diseases (CVD-IP). DNA damage was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate biotin nick end-labelling (TUNEL) and p53, p21 and Fas proteins were detected by immunohistochemistry in 13 cases of CVD-IP, 13 of sarcoidosis, seven of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) and eight control patients with normal lung parenchyma. TUNEL-positive signals were found in bronchiolar or alveolar epithelial cells in 11 of 13 (85%) specimens of CVD-IP, but not in sarcoidosis, HP or controls, except for a case of chronic HP with pulmonary fibrosis. p53, p21 and Fas were detected in bronchiolar or alveolar epithelial cells in nine (69%), 10 (77%) and 12 (92%) of 13 specimens of CVD-IP, respectively, but not in sarcoidosis, HP or controls, except for a case of chronic HP. These results suggest that the upregulation of p53, p21 and Fas in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells associated with deoxyribonucleic acid damage may participate in the process of pulmonary fibrosis in interstitial pneumonia associated with collagen vascular diseases and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
11024025	Nucleophile selection for the endonuclease activities of human, ovine, and avian retroviral integrases.	Retroviral integrases catalyze four endonuclease reactions (processing, joining, disintegration, and nonspecific alcoholysis) that differ in specificity for the attacking nucleophile and target DNA sites. To assess how the two substrates of this enzyme affect each other, we performed quantitative analyses, in three retroviral systems, of the two reactions that use a variety of nucleophiles. The integrase proteins of human immuno- deficiency virus type 1, visna virus, and Rous sarcoma virus exhibited distinct preferences for water or other nucleophiles during site-specific processing of viral DNA and during nonspecific alcoholysis of nonviral DNA. Although exogenous alcohols competed with water as the nucleophile for processing, the alcohols stimulated nicking of nonviral DNA. Moreover, different nucleophiles were preferred when the various integrases acted on different DNA targets. In contrast, the nicking patterns were independent of whether integrase was catalyzing hydrolysis or alcoholysis and were not influenced by the particular exogenous alcohol. Thus, although the target DNA influenced the choice of nucleophile, the nucleophile did not affect the choice of target sites. These results indicate that interaction with target DNA is the critical step before catalysis and suggest that integrase does not reach an active conformation until target DNA has bound to the enzyme.
11085656	New insights in the cellular processing of platinum antitumor compounds, using fluorophore-labeled platinum complexes and digital fluorescence microscopy.	The cellular distribution and processing pathways of two platinum compounds, modeling the antitumor drug cisplatin (cDDP) in human osteosarcoma (U2-OS) cells is reported. A [Pt(en)Cl] entity has been covalently linked to a carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) moiety and to a dinitrophenyl (DNP) moiety. The two different constructs were administered to living cell cultures that were analyzed using digital fluorescence microscopy. The non-fluorescent CFDA construct becomes fluorescent after cellular uptake and subsequent acetate hydrolysis by esterases, and is therefore suitable to monitor platinum in living cells; the DNP construct can be visualized by immunocytochemistry and consequently serves as a control. Both complexes were readily internalized by the cells, and localized throughout the whole cell. After 2-3 h the complex accumulated in the nucleus, but 6-8 h after incubation a punctuate staining of a cytoplasmic region was observed, that persisted and became more pronounced after 24 h. The overall fluorescence in the cell decreased over time, implying a secretion of the platinum complex. Surprisingly, the accumulation remained visible after 72 h. Co-localization experiments with a Golgi apparatus-selective stain indicate the involvement of Golgi vesicles in intracellular processing of cisplatin-derived complexes. Immunocytochemical studies, using the DNP derivative, resulted in very similar images as obtained with the CFDA construct. CFDA-boc (a non-platinum-containing fluorescein derivative) was used as control: a faint staining throughout the whole cell was observed. Cisplatin-resistant U2-OS/Pt cells showed staining patterns very similar to the U2-OS cells using both platinum constructs. This study illustrates that only a very small portion of the platinum complex eventually remains bound to DNA, as after 24 h no significant fluorescence could be observed in the nucleus. Cisplatin-derived complexes with fluorescent tags afford a new insight into the cellular processing of these complexes and therefore may contribute to further unraveling of the mechanism of platinum antitumor complexes.
11746507	Distribution of somatic H1 subtypes is non-random on active vs. inactive chromatin II: distribution in human adult fibroblasts.	For nearly twenty years researchers have observed changes in the histone H1 subtype content of tissues as an organism develops into an adult. To better understand the consequences of such changes, immunofractionation of chromatin using previously characterized antibodies specific for human H1 subtypes was employed in the analysis of a fibroblast cell strain derived from a 37-year-old individual. DNAs isolated from immunoprecipitates were probed for the existence of a variety of DNA sequences. The results presented lend further support to a previously-proposed model (Parseghian et al. [2000] Chromosome Res 8:405-424) in which transcription of a sequence is accompanied by the selective depletion of subtypes. The data also suggest that there is more total H1 on actively transcribed sequences in these cells as compared to fetal fibroblasts and that there is less difference in the subtype compositions of active genes vs. inactive sequences in this strain. Specifically, the consequences of these changes appear to correlate with the attenuation of the heat shock response in aging fibroblasts. In a broader context, these results could explain why there are reductions in transcription in cells from mature tissue that approach senescence.
12606119	Transcription, nucleosome positioning and protein binding modulate nucleotide excision repair of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MET17 promoter.	We have assessed how transcription, chromatin structure and protein binding modulate nucleotide excision repair in the upstream regulatory region and early coding region of the endogenous Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene MET17. Removal of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers was measured from these regions, in which transcription and chromatin structure could be regulated independently of each other. Distinct repair trends were apparent depending on transcriptional state. When transcription was repressed nucleosome positioning and protein binding as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative real-time PCR, were significant factors. Nucleosome positioning and/or protein binding effects were most apparent on the strand that becomes transcribed, with repair occurring fastest in a nucleosome free region but being retarded where regulatory proteins bound within this region. When transcription was derepressed the rate of repair increased on both strands in a region beginning 200 bp upstream of the TATA box and extending downstream into the coding region. This effect overrode the influences of nucleosome positioning and protein binding.
9172387	Effects of compensatory solutes on DNA and chromatin structural organization in solution.	We investigated the effect of glycine and other osmotic effectors on DNA and chromatin precipitation by mono-, di- and multivalent cations and histone H1. The addition of these compounds drastically reduces the precipitation effects with an efficiency in the order taurine > glycine > proline and sorbitol > inositol > betaine. Aminocarboxylic acids with increasing distance between the charged C- and N-terminal groups displayed enhanced efficiency in the protection effect against DNA precipitation. We interpreted these observations on the basis of Manning's counterion condensation theory, taking into account the increase in dielectric constant upon osmotic effector addition. 23Na-NMR was used to evidence sodium counterions release as a result of this increase in dielectric constant.
9312024	p45 NF-E2 regulates expression of thromboxane synthase in megakaryocytes.	Transcription factor p45 NF-E2 is highly expressed in the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. Although p45 recognizes regulatory regions of several erythroid genes, mice deficient for this protein display only mild dyserythropoiesis but have abnormal megakaryocytes and lack circulating platelets. A number of megakaryocytic marker genes have been extensively studied, but none of them is regulated by NF-E2. To find target genes for p45 NF-E2 in megakaryopoiesis, we used an in vivo immunoselection assay: genomic fragments bound to p45 NF-E2 in the chromatin of a megakaryocytic cell line were immunoprecipitated with an anti-p45 antiserum and cloned. One of these fragments belongs to the second intron of the thromboxane synthase gene (TXS). We demonstrate that the TXS gene, which is mainly expressed in megakaryocytes, is indeed directly regulated by p45 NF-E2. First, its promoter contains a functional NF-E2 binding site; second, the intronic NF-E2 binding site is located within a chromatin-dependent enhancer element; third, p45-null murine megakaryocytes do not express detectable TXS mRNA, although TXS expression can be detected in other cells. These data, and the structure of the TXS promoter and enhancer, suggest that TXS belongs to a distinct subgroup of genes involved in platelet formation and function.
9442103	Identification of a preinitiation step in DNA replication that is independent of origin recognition complex and cdc6, but dependent on cdk2.	Before initiation of DNA replication, origin recognition complex (ORC) proteins, cdc6, and minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins bind to chromatin sequentially and form preinitiation complexes. Using Xenopus laevis egg extracts, we find that after the formation of these complexes and before initiation of DNA replication, cdc6 is rapidly removed from chromatin, possibly degraded by a cdk2-activated, ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway. If this displacement is inhibited, DNA replication fails to initiate. We also find that after assembly of MCM proteins into preinitiation complexes, removal of the ORC from DNA does not block the subsequent initiation of replication. Importantly, under conditions in which both ORC and cdc6 protein are absent from preinitiation complexes, DNA replication is still dependent on cdk2 activity. Therefore, the final steps in the process leading to initiation of DNA replication during S phase of the cell cycle are independent of ORC and cdc6 proteins, but dependent on cdk2 activity.
8886984	Endo-exonuclease of human leukaemic cells: evidence for a role in apoptosis.	"Inactive forms of endo-exonuclease, activated in vitro by treatment with trypsin, have been identified in human leukaemic CEM and MOLT-4 cells. They comprise over 95% of the total single-strand DNase activity in nuclei and are mainly bound to chromatin and the nuclear matrix. The activated enzyme had Mg2+(Mn2+)-dependent, Ca(2+)-stimulated activities with single- and double-strand DNAs and RNA (polyriboadenylic acid) and other properties characteristic of endo-exonucleases previously described. At least twice as much inactive endo-exonuclease has also been localised in extranuclear compartments of CEM and MOLT-4 cells, 85% bound to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and 15% free in the cytosol. The soluble cytosolic trypsin-activatable endo-exonuclease was immunoprecipitated by antibodies raised independently to both Neurospora and monkey CV-1 cell endo-exonucleases. The free and bound enzymes of both nuclear and extranuclear compartments also cross-reacted on immunoblots with the antibody raised to Neurospora endo-exonuclease to reveal multiple polypeptides ranging in size from 18 to 145 kDa, many of which exhibited activity on DNA gels. The major species bound to the chromatin/matrix were in the 55-63 kDa range. Limited proteolysis of the large polypeptides to those of 18 to 46 kDa accompanied spontaneous chromatin DNA fragmentation to form DNA ""ladders' in an isolated nuclei/cytosol system. When the leukaemic cells were treated in culture with either etoposide or podophyllotoxin to induce apoptosis, the largest polypeptides disappeared and smaller endo-exonuclease-related polypeptides of 18 to 46 kDa were detected in the nuclear extracts. The appearance of these polypeptides also correlated with extensive chromatin DNA fragmentation. In addition, there were correlations between the depletion of the major 55-63 kDa species bound to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, depletion of the extranuclear trypsin-activatable activity and the onset and extent of chromatin DNA fragmentation in both cell lines. The extranuclear 55-63 kDa species may be precursors of the chromatin/matrix bound endo-exonuclease. The results indicate that endo-exonuclease plays a role in chromatin DNA degradation in mammalian cells during apoptosis."
9278053	Marking of active genes on mitotic chromosomes.	During development and differentiation, cellular phenotypes are stably propagated through numerous cell divisions. This epigenetic 'cell memory' helps to maintain stable patterns of gene expression. DNA methylation and the propagation of specific chromatin structures may both contribute to cell memory. There are two impediments during the cell cycle that can hinder the inheritance of specific chromatin configurations: first, the pertinent structures must endure the passage of DNA-replication forks in S phase; second, the chromatin state must survive mitosis, when chromatin condenses, transcription is turned off, and almost all double-stranded DNA-binding proteins are displaced. After mitosis, the previous pattern of expressed and silent genes must be restored. This restoration might be governed by mass action, determined by the binding affinities and concentrations of individual components. Alternatively, a subset of factors might remain bound to mitotic chromosomes, providing a molecular bookmark to direct proper chromatin reassembly. Here we analyse DNA at transcription start sites during mitosis in vivo and find that it is conformationally distorted in genes scheduled for reactivation but is undistorted in repressed genes. These protein-dependent conformational perturbations could help to re-establish transcription after mitosis by 'marking' genes for re-expression.
9364931	Enhancement of the transcription potential of nascent chromatin by chromosomal proteins HMG-14/-17 is coupled to nucleosome assembly and not DNA synthesis.	We have previously demonstrated that in Xenopus egg extracts, which support DNA strand synthesis and chromatin assembly, incorporation of chromosomal proteins HMG-14/-17 into nascent nucleosomes increases the transcriptional potential of a chromatin template carrying the Xenopus 5S RNA gene. Here we use the single-stranded and double-stranded forms of a plasmid carrying a 5S RNA maxigene, to test whether the effect of HMG-14/-17 on transcription requires DNA synthesis and whether these proteins will affect transcription through a region containing nucleosomes. We find that most of the transcripts were about 350 nucleotides long, suggesting that HMG-14/-17 enhance transcription through a region that could contain nucleosomes. HMG-14/-17 enhance transcription of chromatin templates assembled onto double-stranded DNA, in the absence of DNA synthesis. Single-round transcription assays suggest that HMG-14/-17 increase transcription from templates assembled onto both single- and double-stranded DNA by increasing the specific activity, and not the number, of transcriptionally active templates. We conclude that the effect of HMG-14/-17 on the transcriptional potential of chromatin is linked to nucleosome assembly and is not linked to DNA synthesis.
10669725	TATA-binding protein mutants that increase transcription from enhancerless and repressed promoters in vivo.	Using a genetic screen, we isolated three TATA-binding protein (TBP) mutants that increase transcription from promoters that are repressed by the Cyc8-Tup1 or Sin3-Rpd3 corepressors or that lack an enhancer element, but not from an equivalently weak promoter with a mutated TATA element. Increased transcription is observed when the TBP mutants are expressed at low levels in the presence of wild-type TBP. These TBP mutants are unable to support cell viability, and they are toxic in strains lacking Rpd3 histone deacetylase or when expressed at higher levels. Although these mutants do not detectably bind TATA elements in vitro, genetic and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that they act directly at promoters and do not increase transcription by titration of a negative regulatory factor(s). The TBP mutants are mildly defective for associating with promoters responding to moderate or strong activators; in addition, they are severely defective for RNA polymerase (Pol) III but not Pol I transcription. These results suggest that, with respect to Pol II transcription, the TBP mutants specifically increase expression from core promoters. Biochemical analysis indicates that the TBP mutants are unaffected for TFIID complex formation, dimerization, and interactions with either the general negative regulator NC2 or the N-terminal inhibitory domain of TAF130. We speculate that these TBP mutants have an unusual structure that allows them to preferentially access TATA elements in chromatin templates. These TBP mutants define a criterion by which promoters repressed by Cyc8-Tup1 or Sin3-Rpd3 resemble enhancerless, but not TATA-defective, promoters; hence, they support the idea that these corepressors inhibit the function of activator proteins rather than the Pol II machinery.
10772872	SH2-Containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) association with Jak2 in UT-7/Epo cells.	We have investigated the interaction of the SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) and Jak2 in an erythropoietin (Epo)-dependent human leukemia cell line, UT-7/Epo, using reciprocal immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. The Epo-induced kinetics and dose response on phosphorylated Jak2 in anti-SHP-1 precipitates of UT-7/Epo cell lysates were similar to those in direct anti-Jak2 precipitates, suggesting that Jak2 coprecipitated with SHP-1. Furthermore, immunoblotting with anti-Jak2 and anti-SHP-1 antibodies indicated that SHP-1 appeared to be constitutively associated with non-tyrosine-phosphorylated Jak2 in UT-7/Epo cells in the absence of Epo and without phosphorylation of the Epo receptor (EpoR). Competition studies with C-terminal SHP-1 and Jak2 peptides decreased the amounts of SHP-1 and Jak2 detected in immunoprecipitates supporting the specific coprecipitation of SHP-1 and Jak2. In the presence of a recombinant GST-fusion protein containing both the N-terminal and C-terminal SH2 domains of SHP-1, anti-GST precipitated the fusion protein but not cellular Jak2. These studies suggest that SHP-1 and Jak2 are constitutively associated in UT-7/EPO cells. The association is not dependent upon Epo and is not mediated via SHP-1 SH2 binding. Sequential double immunoprecipitation demonstrated that only a small portion of intracellular Jak2 and SHP-1 molecules are constitutively associated. This partial association pattern may allow a more flexible and diverse regulation of Jak2 and SHP-1 activities. Whether Jak2 and SHP-1 are directly associated with each other or are part of a larger complex needs further investigation.
11376162	Selection and identification of proteins bound to DNA triple-helical structures by combination of 2D-electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.	Identification of proteins binding specifically to peculiar nucleic acid structures can lead to comprehension of their role in vivo and contribute to the discovery of structure-related gene regulation. This work was devoted to establishing a reliable procedure to select proteins on the basis of their interaction with a nucleic acid probe chosen to fold into a given structure. 2D-electrophoresis and mass spectrometry were combined for protein identification. We applied this procedure to select and identify triplex-binding activities in HeLa nuclear extracts. To achieve this, we used a panel of deoxyribonucleic probes adopting intramolecular triple-helices, varying in their primary sequence, structure or triple-helix motif. A limited number of spots was reproducibly revealed by South-western blotting. Spots of interest were localised among a complex population of (35)S-labelled proteins according to their (32)P-specific emission. Position of the same spots was extrapolated on a preparative gel coloured with Coomassie blue, allowing excision and purification of the corresponding proteins. The material was subjected to mass spectrometry upon trypsin digestion and MALDI-TOF peptide fingerprinting was used for research in databases: five of them were identified and found to belong to the hnRNP family (K, L, A2/B1, E1 and I). The identities of several of them were confirmed by comparing western and South-western blots on the same membrane using specific antibodies. The recognition specificity of most of these proteins is large, according to previous reports and our own experiments. It includes pyrimidine-rich DNA sequences in different contexts: single strand to a small extent, triplex and possibly other higher-order structures.
11399075	Sfl1 functions via the co-repressor Ssn6-Tup1 and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase Tpk2.	Ssn6 (Cyc8) is a component of the yeast general corepressor Ssn6-Tup1 that inhibits the transcription of many diversely regulated genes. The corepressor does not interact directly with DNA but is recruited to different promoters through interactions with distinct pathway-specific, DNA-binding repressor proteins. Using yeast two-hybrid and GST chromatography interaction experiments, we have determined that Sfl1, a novel repressor protein, interacts directly with Ssn6, and in vivo repression data suggest that Sfl1 inhibits transcription by recruiting Ssn6-Tup1 via a specific domain in the Sfl1 protein. Sin4 and Srb10, components of specific RNA polymerase II sub-complexes that are required for Ssn6-Tup1 repression activity, are found to be required for Sfl1 repression function. These results indicate a possible mechanism for Sfl1-mediated repression via Ssn6-Tup1 and specific subunits of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immuno-precipitation assays demonstrate that Sfl1 is present at the promoters of three Ssn6-Tup1-repressible genes; namely, FLO11, HSP26, and SUC2. Sfl1 is known to interact with Tpk2, a cAMP-dependent protein kinase that negatively regulates Sfl1 function. Consistently, we show that phosphorylation by protein kinase A inhibits Sfl1 DNA binding in vitro, and that a tpk2Delta mutation increases the levels of Sfl1 protein associated with specific promoter elements in vivo. These data indicate a possible mechanism for regulating Sfl1-mediated repression through modulation of DNA binding by cAMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation. Taken together with previous data, these new observations suggest a link between cAMP signaling and Ssn6-Tup1-mediated transcriptional repression.
12536523	[Ischemic preconditioning inhibits ischemia/reperfusion induced myocardial apoptosis in rabbits in vivo].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of ischemic preconditioning on myocardial apoptosis induced by ischemia/reperfusion. METHODS: Twenty four rabbits were randomly allocated to three groups(n = 8), pseudo-operation group(group P), ischemia/reperfusion group(group IR), and ischemic preconditioning group (group IP). Group IR and group IP were subjected to three hours of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by three hours of reperfusion. Ischemic preconditioning was achieved by three 5-minute cycles of ischemia, each followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion. Infarct size and area at risk were defined by dual staining with triphenyltetrazolium chloride and Evans blue dye. DNA laddering in the border zone myocardium of ischemic area at risk was revealed with agarose gel electrophoresis, and apoptosis index(AI) was obtained with flow cytometry. RESULTS: Infarct size, expressed as a percentage of the area at risk(IS:AR), was(60.8 +/- 10.8)% in group IR. Ischemic preconditioning reduced myocardial infarct size significantly to (33.1 +/- 4.9)% (P < 0.05). AI was (13.83 +/- 3.98)% in group IR, and were reduced significantly to (5.85 +/- 1.59)% in group IP(P < 0.01). DNA laddering indicative of fragmented DNA was clearly demonstrated in myocardial specimens sampled from the lateral border zones of the ischemic area at risk in group IR but were attenuated in group IP. CONCLUSION: It suggests that ischemic preconditioning inhibits the rabbit myocardial apoptosis induced by ischemia/reperfusion in vivo.
7844521	Identification and characterization of the major proteins of malignant catarrhal fever virus.	Malignant catarrhal fever virus (MCFV), a gamma-herpesvirus, causes a severe inflammatory and lymphoproliferative disease of cattle and other susceptible ruminants. Polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the Minnesota isolate of MCFV were produced and used to examine the characteristics of the viral proteins. Immunoprecipitation of antigens of the Minnesota isolate of MCFV with polyclonal antisera revealed at least 11 proteins with molecular masses ranging from 17 kDa to 145 kDa. Among 279 candidate anti-MCFV hybridomas, 14 were selected and clustered into six groups on the basis of the patterns of reactivity to viral proteins in immunoprecipitation and immunoblot. The group I MAbs exhibited strong neutralizing activity and recognized a glycosylation-dependent conformational epitope on a 110 kDa protein. The MAbs in group II bound a non-neutralizing conformational epitope on a 130 kDa non-glycosylated protein. A glycosylated protein complex of 115/110/105/78/45 kDa moieties was identified by the MAbs in group III. The MAbs in groups IV, V and VI reacted with non-glycosylated proteins of 36/34 kDa, 24 kDa and 17 kDa, respectively. Comparison of three MCFV isolates [the Minnesota isolate, the Austrian isolate (Au-732) and the African prototype isolate (WC-11)] revealed no apparent differences in immunoprecipitation patterns with the single exception that the 110 kDa protein of WC-11 was slightly smaller than its counterpart in the Minnesota isolate.
9023118	Enzymatic activities involved in the DNA resynthesis step of nucleotide excision repair are firmly attached to chromatin.	In this study the role of nuclear architecture in nucleotide excision repair (NER) was investigated by gentle dismantling of the cell and probing the capability of chromatin to carry out repair in vitro. The rationale behind this approach is that compartmentalization of NER at nuclear structures would make the enzymatic activities refractory to extraction by buffers that solubilize cellular membranes. In order to obtain intact chromatin primary human fibroblasts were encapsulated in agarose microbeads and lysed in isotonic buffers containing the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100. Under these conditions the majority of cellular proteins diffuse out of the beads, but the remaining chromatin is able to replicate and to transcribe DNA in the presence of triphosphates and Mg2+. UV irradiation of confluent repair-proficient human fibroblasts prior to lysis stimulated the incorporation of deoxynucleotide triphosphates in Triton X-100-isolated chromatin, even under stringent lysis conditions. In addition, experiments with UV-sensitive xeroderma pigmentosum (complementation groups A and C) and Cockayne's syndrome fibroblasts (complementation group A) revealed that this repair synthesis was due to global genome repair activity. Transcription-coupled repair was only detectable in cells permeabilized by streptolysin O (SLO). Repair synthesis in Triton X-100-isolated chromatin amounted to 15% of the total repair synthesis as measured in SLO-permeabilized cells. To allow the detection of these activities in vitro, presynthesis complexes have to be formed in intact cells, indicating that chromatin from Triton X-100-lysed cells is unable to initiate NER in vitro. Our data indicate that the components involved in the resynthesis step of NER are tightly associated with chromatin. A substantial fraction of total proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which is required for the resynthesis step in NER, has been reported to become Triton X-100 non-extractable and tightly associated with nuclear structures after UV irradiation of cells. We propose that Triton X-100-resistant repair synthesis might be mediated by this chromatin-bound fraction of total PCNA.
9567200	Preparation and imaging of nuclear spreads from cells of the zebrafish embryo. Evidence for large degradation intermediates in apoptosis.	We describe a method for preparing nuclear spreads from cells of live, unfixed zebrafish embryos at the late-gastrula (approximately 8000 cell) stage of development. The method consists of a sequence of four steps: (1) a slow, gentle lysis, in low to moderate salt concentration, of cells and then nuclei, to release DNA-containing fibres; (2) spreading of the released fibres by a transverse fluid flow; (3) electrostatic, and possibly also covalent, attachment of the spread fibers to poly(L-lysine)-coated glass microscope slides; and (4) continued incubation to produce periodic cleavage of the DNA within the fibres, apparently through activation of endogenous nucleases. The nuclear spreads are imaged with epifluorescence, at a spatial resolution approaching the Rayleigh limit (approximately 230 nm for blue light). The epifluorescent signal is provided from Hoechst 33,258 bound specifically to the DNA, from a dye-coupled antibody conjugate bound specifically to histone H1 in the fibres, or from a DNA nick end-labelling assay. The spontaneous cleavage of DNA-containing fibres in step (4) of the above procedure can be blocked by the chelating agents EGTA and EDTA, by the caspase-2,3,7 inhibitor N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde, and by the caspase-1,4,5 inhibitors N-acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde and N-acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethyl ketone. These data suggest that the spontaneous cleavage of fibres is catalysed by nucleases that become activated through a caspase-mediated mechanism. The involvement of caspase-dependent nucleases would suggest that an apoptosis pathway is activated in the spreads during their prolonged incubation. If bona fide apoptosis is induced in living zebrafish embryos by treatment with camptothecin (a topoisomerase I poison), and then nuclear spreads are prepared, we observe a similar fragmentation of the spread fibres. However, in this case the fragmentation is more rapid and complete. We hypothesize that, during the early phase of apoptosis, one or more endogenous nucleases are activated by a caspase-mediated mechanism. The nuclease(s) then specifically recognize and cleave a susceptible, periodically repeating feature of interphase chromatin.
11385626	Location analysis of DNA-bound proteins at the whole-genome level: untangling transcriptional regulatory networks.	In this post-sequencing era, geneticists can focus on functional genomics on a much larger scale than ever before. One goal is the discovery and elucidation of the intricate genetic networks that co-ordinate transcriptional activation in different regulatory circuitries. High-throughput gene expression measurement using DNA arrays has thus become routine strategy. This approach, however, does not directly identify gene loci that belong to the same regulatory group; e.g., those that are bound by a common (set of) transcription factor(s). Working in yeast, two groups have recently published an elegant method that could circumvent this problem, by combining chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA microarrays.(1,2) The method is likely to provide a powerful tool for the dissection of global regulatory networks in eukaryotic cells.
11562464	In vivo interactions of archaeal Cdc6/Orc1 and minichromosome maintenance proteins with the replication origin.	Although genome analyses have suggested parallels between archaeal and eukaryotic replication systems, little is known about the DNA replication mechanism in Archaea. By two-dimensional gel electrophoreses we positioned a replication origin (oriC) within 1 kb in the chromosomal DNA of Pyrococcus abyssi, an anaerobic hyperthermophile, and demonstrated that the oriC is physically linked to the cdc6 gene. Our chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that P. abyssi Cdc6 and minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins bind preferentially to the oriC region in the exponentially growing cells. Whereas the oriC association of MCM was specifically inhibited by stopping DNA replication with puromycin treatment, Cdc6 protein stayed bound to the replication origin after de novo protein synthesis was inhibited. Our data suggest that archaeal and eukaryotic Cdc6 and MCM proteins function similarly in replication initiation and imply that an oriC association of MCM could be regulated by an unknown mechanism in Archaea.
12006616	CENP-C binds the alpha-satellite DNA in vivo at specific centromere domains.	CENP-C is a fundamental component of the centromere, highly conserved among species and necessary for the proper assembly of the kinetochore structure and for the metaphase-anaphase transition. Although CENP-C can bind DNA in vitro, the identification of the DNA sequences associated with it in vivo and the significance of such an interaction have been, until now, elusive. To address this problem we took advantage of a chromatin-immunoprecipitation procedure and applied this technique to human HeLa cells. Through this approach we could establish that: (1) CENP-C binds the alpha-satellite DNA selectively; (2) the CENP-C region between amino acids 410 and 537, previously supposed to contain a DNA-binding domain, is indeed required to perform such a function in vivo; and (3) the profile of the alpha-satellite DNA associated with CENP-C is essentially identical to that recognized by CENP-B. However, further biochemical and ultrastructural characterization of CENP-B/DNA and CENP-C/DNA complexes, relative to their DNA components and specific spatial distribution in interphase nuclei, surprisingly reveals that CENP-C and CENP-B associate with the same types of alpha-satellite arrays but in distinct non-overlapping centromere domains. Our results, besides extending previous observations on the role of CENP-C in the formation of active centromeres, show, for the first time, that CENP-C can associate with the centromeric DNA sequences in vivo and, together with CENP-B, defines a highly structured organization of the alpha-satellite DNA within the human centromere.
12149244	Apaf-1 is a mediator of E2F-1-induced apoptosis.	E2F-1 is capable of promoting both cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The latter is important for suppressing untoward expansion of proliferating cells. In this study, we investigated its underlying mechanisms. E2F-1-induced apoptosis was accompanied by caspase-9 activation and inhibited by a specific inhibitor of caspase-9 in K562 sublines overexpressing E2F-1. E2F-1 enhanced the expression of Apaf-1 without the cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c. Apaf-1-deficient melanoma cell lines were resistant to E2F-1, indicating that Apaf-1 is an essential element of E2F-1-mediated apoptosis. Finally, we isolated the promoter region of the Apaf-1 gene and found a putative binding site for E2F. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that E2F-1 bound to Apaf-1 promoter upon E2F-1 overexpression, suggesting that Apaf-1 is under transcriptional regulation of E2F-1. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism of apoptosis in which an increase in Apaf-1 levels results in direct activation of caspase-9 without mitochondrial damage, leading to the initiation of a caspase cascade.
12446763	Developmental changes in the Sciara II/9A initiation zone for DNA replication.	Developmentally regulated initiation of DNA synthesis was studied in the fly Sciara at locus II/9A. PCR analysis of nascent strands revealed an initiation zone that spans approximately 8 kb in mitotic embryonic cells and endoreplicating salivary glands but contracts to 1.2 to 2.0 kb during DNA amplification of DNA puff II/9A. Thus, the amplification origin occurs within the initiation zone used for normal replication. The initiation zone left-hand border is constant, but the right-hand border changes during development. Also, there is a shift in the preferred site for initiation of DNA synthesis during DNA amplification compared to that in preamplification stages. This is the first demonstration that once an initiation zone is defined in embryos, its borders and preferred replication start sites can change during development. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that the RNA polymerase II 140-kDa subunit occupies the promoter of gene II/9-1 during DNA amplification, even though intense transcription will not start until the next developmental stage. RNA polymerase II is adjacent to the right-hand border of the initiation zone at DNA amplification but not at preamplification, suggesting that it may influence the position of this border. These findings support a relationship between the transcriptional machinery and establishment of the replication initiation zone.
12923186	Cha, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor involved in the regulation of upstream stimulatory factor activity.	We report here the characterization of Cha, a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family. The basic region of Cha shares DNA-interacting amino acids with members of class C bHLH transcription factors. In addition, the HLH region of Cha presents a Myc-type dimerization domain signature required for heterodimer formation between members of this class. Cha protein and mRNA were ubiquitously expressed in many human tissues. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that Cha and upstream stimulatory factor (USF)-1 formed a complex that specifically bound to E-box DNA elements. Moreover, pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed an interaction between Cha and USF-1. Cha did not bind to E-box DNA elements and required USF-1 for protein-DNA complex formation. Moreover, Cha inhibited USF-1-stimulated transcription of CD2 (a USF-1-dependent gene) and E-box promoter reporter plasmids. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Cha occupied the CD2 promoter in resting, but not in mitogen-stimulated, T cells. Finally, Cha mRNA and protein expression were high in resting T cells and absent in mitogen-activated T cells and inversely correlated with CD2 expression. Contrarily, overexpression of Cha in T cells significantly reduced CD2 expression. In summary, our results indicated that Cha is a new bHLH transcription factor that negatively regulates USF-dependent transcription.
8037891	Biomonitoring of nitropolynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons via protein and DNA adducts.	Nitropolynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (nitro-PAHs) are widely distributed in the environment. For several chemicals in this class of compounds, mutagenic activity in bacterial and mammalian systems and tumorigenic activity in laboratory animals have been clearly documented. Procedures for assessing the risk to humans from exposure to nitro-PAHs have not been clearly defined, despite the wide-spread occurrence of such agents in the environment and their possible involvement in the etiology of some human cancers. Several methods are available for determining exposure, uptake, and metabolic activation of genotoxic carcinogens in humans. DNA adducts currently are regarded as the most direct markers of genotoxicity. However, several proteins are equally capable of forming adducts with electrophiles derived from xenobiotics. We focused on developing methods to detect and quantify adducts of 1-nitropyrene and 1,6-dinitropyrene with proteins and with DNA. 1-Nitropyrene is the most abundant nitro-PAH in emissions from combustion sources such as diesel engines. Although 1,6-dinitropyrene is far more mutagenic and more tumorigenic than 1-nitropyrene, it is present in the environment at lower levels. Seeking a highly sensitive method, we have utilized the 32P-postlabeling technique to establish the pattern of the DNA adducts formed in rat tissues, as well as in peripheral blood lymphocytes, following administration of both 1-nitropyrene and 1,6-dinitropyrene. We also present results on hemoglobin and albumin adducts formed after administration of these nitro-PAHs. [3H]1-Nitropyrene was given to male or female Fischer-344 or Sprague-Dawley rats by gavage at five dose levels ranging from 0.1 to 1,000 micrograms/kg of body weight. This led to stable hemoglobin adducts, which accounted for 0.08% +/- 0.05% of the dose. The radioactivity associated with hemoglobin following administration of [3H]1-nitropyrene was cleared with a half-life of 13.6 days. This is faster than the clearance of unmodified erythrocytes in the rat (half-life of 30 days). Treating the hemoglobin with 1% hydrochloric acid in acetone, to precipitate the globin, released the radioactivity so that none remained bound to the globin. Rather, the radioactivity remained bound to the heme moiety. To obtain structural information about the heme adducts, we incubated [3H]1-nitrosopyrene and [3H]4,5-epoxy-4,5-dihydro-1-nitropyrene with rat hemoglobin. In each case, [3H] was bound mainly to globin and, to a lesser extent, to the heme moiety.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
8204594	Ethidium bromide intercalation and chromatin structure: a spectropolarimetric analysis.	Native chromatin has been characterized at different ionic strengths, according to different methods of preparation, by means of circular dichroism and ethidium bromide intercalation. For a more precise interpretation of these results, a series of analogous experiments on phagic DNA, as a function of its circularization, and on mononucleosomes have been performed. Results are discussed here in terms of high order chromatin structure, DNA supercoiling, and topological constraints.
9062987	Role of polyethyleneimine in the purification of recombinant human tumour necrosis factor beta.	The chromatographic behaviour of recombinant human tumour necrosis factor beta (rhTNF-beta) (pI approximately 9.0) during cation-exchange chromatography at pH 7.5 is investigated. Without prior treatment of the Escherichia coli cell extract with polyethyleneimine (PEI), very little rhTNF-beta was bound to the column. However, upon addition of 5% PEI (100 microliters ml-1) to the cell lysate, rhTNF-beta was shown to bind to cation-exchange columns normally. TNF-beta was readily precipitated from the clarified cell extract by 20% ammonium sulphate, but ony ca. 25% of this precipitate could be re-solubilized for further purification. However, when 5% PEI was included in the solubilization buffer, the balance of the rhTNF-beta could be recovered. It is proposed that charge interaction between rhTNF-beta and nucleic acids in the cell extract is responsible for both of these anomalous phenomena, and that PEI (a cationic polyelectrolyte) was able to disrupt this interaction by displacing rhTNF-beta from the charge complex.
10075891	Formaldehyde cross-linking for studying nucleosomal dynamics.	Methods are described for the utilization of formaldehyde as a reversible cross-linking agent for the characterization of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. The methods include a description of procedures to: (1) isolate and characterize transcriptionally active chromatin from cells cross-linked with formaldehyde; (2) study histone mobility during replication and transcription by the characterization of the formaldehyde-cross-linked histone octamer that is isolated from cells labeled with density-labeled amino acids; and (3) cross-link the in vitro reconstituted histone-DNA complex in order to maintain its structural state during subsequent characterization. Included in these methods are procedures for a second dimensional analysis of protein-protein cross-links in which the monomer components are electrophoretically resolved in the second dimension. The methods also include procedures to selectively reverse protein-DNA cross-links while maintaining the protein-protein cross-links. Potential artifacts are also discussed; i.e., data are presented which indicate that the helical pitch of DNA can be altered if the ionic strength is not properly controlled. The stability of the cross-linked nucleosome in the presence of altered pH or salt/urea concentrations is described in order to indicate that there are limitations to procedures that can be used for the subsequent characterization of the cross-linked complex.
10362684	Ischemic preconditioning and myocardial hypothermia in rabbits with prolonged coronary artery occlusion.	This study tests whether combining regional hypothermia and ischemic preconditioning (IP) provides greater myocardial protection during prolonged coronary artery occlusion (CAO) than either intervention alone, and whether increasing the duration of IP from 5 to 7 min extends the window of protection to include a 2-h CAO. Anesthetized rabbits were randomized to four groups (n = 8 rabbits/group): control (C), hypothermia alone (H), IP alone for two 7-min episodes (IP7), and IP plus hypothermia (H + IP7). To compare differences in IP for 5 versus 7 min, additional rabbits (n = 6) received one 5-min episode of ischemia (IP5). All rabbits got 2 h of CAO and 3 h of reperfusion. In comparison with the infarct size in the control group (72 +/- 4% of the risk zone), infarct size was significantly reduced in H (50 +/- 7%), IP7 (49 +/- 5%), and H + IP7 (42 +/- 6%) (all P < 0.05 vs. control group). IP5 failed to confer protection (67 +/- 5% of the risk zone). Therefore, IP can protect against a 2-h CAO if the IP regimen is increased from 5 to 7 min. The combination therapy significantly improved regional myocardial blood flow in the previously ischemic region to a greater extent than either treatment alone.
11349159	Human sperm deoxyribonucleic acid fragmentation by specific types of papillomavirus.	OBJECTIVE: Human papillomaviruses are present in up to 64.3% of patients' sperm. The objectives were (1) to determine human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid effects on sperm deoxyribonucleic acid integrity and (2) to assess human papillomavirus differential effects on the sperm cell. STUDY DESIGN: Two-layer colloid washed sperm were exposed to E6-E7 deoxyribonucleic acid fragments generated from human papillomavirus types 16, 18, 31, 33, 6/11, or control (DQA1) for 24 hours. The motility parameters were measured and analyzed. Pilot studies were performed to develop a fixed sperm comet assay to assess deoxyribonucleic acid fragmentation. RESULTS: Significant sperm deoxyribonucleic acid fragmentation occurred after exposure to deoxyribonucleic acid of human papillomavirus types 16 and 31. Human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid fragment size was not a factor. Human papillomavirus types 18, 33, and 6/11 did not compromise sperm deoxyribonucleic acid integrity. Washed sperm motility was higher in the presence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid except for type 6/11. Amplitude of head displacement was lower for human papillomavirus types 16 and 6/11. Sperm linearity was increased for all human papillomavirus types except type 18. CONCLUSION: Human papillomavirus type 16 and 31 deoxyribonucleic acid caused deoxyribonucleic acid breakages characteristic of apoptotic but not necrotic sperm. The data suggest that these human papillomavirus types may adversely affect subsequent embryonic development after fertilization. Sperm deoxyribonucleic acid appears to resist human papillomavirus types 18, 33, and 6/11 or repairing mechanisms occurred. Although enhanced motility was found in human papillomavirus-exposed sperm, important velocity parameters were decreased, suggesting impaired sperm function.
12417732	Inhibitors of histone deacetylase and DNA methyltransferase synergistically activate the methylated metallothionein I promoter by activating the transcription factor MTF-1 and forming an open chromatin structure.	Inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) and histone deacetylases (HDAC) synergistically activate the methylated metallothionein I gene (MT-I) promoter in mouse lymphosarcoma cells. The cooperative effect of these two classes of inhibitors on MT-I promoter activity was robust following demethylation of only a few CpG dinucleotides by brief exposure to 5-azacytidine (5-AzaC) but persisted even after prolonged treatment with the nucleoside analog. HDAC inhibitors (trichostatin A [TSA] and depsipeptide) either alone or in combination with 5-AzaC did not facilitate demethylation of the MT-I promoter. Treatment of cells with HDAC inhibitors increased accumulation of multiply acetylated forms of H3 and H4 histones that remained unaffected after treatment with 5-AzaC. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed increased association of acetylated histone H4 and lysine 9 (K9)-acetyl H3 with the MT-I promoter after treatment with TSA, which was not affected following treatment with 5-AzaC. In contrast, the association of K9-methyl histone H3 with the MT-I promoter decreased significantly after treatment with 5-AzaC and TSA. ChIP assay with antibodies specific for methyl-CpG binding proteins (MBDs) demonstrated that only methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) was associated with the MT-I promoter, which was significantly enhanced after TSA treatment. Association of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) with the promoter decreased after treatment with TSA or 5-AzaC and was abolished after treatment with both inhibitors. Among the DNA methyltransferases, both Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a were associated with the MT-I promoter in the lymphosarcoma cells, and association of Dnmt1 decreased with time after treatment with 5-AzaC. Treatment of these cells with HDAC inhibitors also increased expression of the MTF-1 (metal transcription factor-1) gene as well as its DNA binding activity. In vivo genomic footprinting studies demonstrated increased occupancy of MTF-1 to metal response elements of the MT-I promoter after treatment with both inhibitors. Analysis of the promoter by mapping with restriction enzymes in vivo showed that the MT-I promoter attained a more open chromatin structure after combined treatment with 5-AzaC and TSA as opposed to treatment with either agent alone. These results implicate involvement of multifarious factors including modified histones, MBDs, and Dnmts in silencing the methylated MT-I promoter in lymphosarcoma cells. The synergistic activation of this promoter by these two types of inhibitors is due to demethylation of the promoter and altered association of different factors that leads to reorganization of the chromatin and the resultant increase in accessibility of the promoter to the activated transcription factor MTF-1.
12426319	Transcription factor occupancy of the insulin gene in vivo. Evidence for direct regulation by Nkx2.2.	Consensus-binding sites for many transcription factors are relatively non-selective and found at high frequency within the genome. This raises the possibility that factors that are capable of binding to a cis-acting element in vitro and regulating transcription from a transiently transfected plasmid, which would not have higher order chromatin structure, may not occupy this site within the endogenous gene. Closed chromatin structure and competition from another DNA-binding protein with similar nucleotide specificity are two possible mechanisms by which a transcription factor may be excluded from a potential binding site in vivo. Multiple transcription factors, including Pdx-1, BETA-2, and Pax6, have been implicated in expression of the insulin gene in pancreatic beta cells. In this study, the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay has been used to show that these factors do, in fact, bind to insulin control region sequences in intact beta cells. In addition, another key islet-enriched transcription factor, Nkx2.2, was found to occupy this region using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In vitro DNA-binding and transient transfection assays defined how Nkx2.2 affected insulin gene expression. Pdx-1 was also shown to bind within a region of the endogenous islet amyloid polypeptide, pax-4, and glucokinase genes that were associated with control in vitro. Because Pdx-1 does not regulate gene transcription in isolation, these sequences were examined for occupancy by the other insulin transcriptional regulators. BETA-2, Pax6, and Nkx2.2 were also found to bind to amyloid polypeptide, glucokinase, and pax-4 control sequences in vivo. These studies reveal the broad application of the Pdx-1, BETA-2, Pax6, and Nkx2.2 transcription factors in regulating expression of genes selectively expressed in islet beta cells.
10429254	Purification of plasmid DNA using selective precipitation by compaction agents.	A scaleable method for the liquid-phase separation of plasmid DNA from RNA.
11209047	The role of rigidity in DNA looping-unlooping by AraC.	We applied two experiments useful in the study of ligand-regulated DNA binding proteins to AraC, the dimeric regulator of the Escherichia coli l-arabinose operon. In the absence of arabinose, AraC prefers to loop DNA by binding to two half-sites that are separated by 210 base pairs, and in the presence of arabinose it prefers to bind to adjacently located half-sites. The basis for this ligand-regulated shift in binding appears to result from a shift in the rigidity of the system, where rigidity both in AraC protein in the absence of arabinose, and in the DNA are required to generate the free energy differences that produce the binding preferences. Eliminating the dimerization domains and connecting the two DNA binding domains of AraC by a flexible peptide linker should provide a protein whose behavior mimics that of AraC when there is no interaction between its dimerization and DNA binding domains. The resulting protein bound to adjacent half-sites on the DNA, like AraC protein in the presence of arabinose. When the two double-stranded DNA half-sites were connected by 24 bases of single-stranded, flexible DNA, wild-type AraC protein bound to the DNA in the presence and absence of arabinose with equal affinity, showing that AraC modulates its DNA binding affinity in response to arabinose by shifting the relative positions of its DNA binding domains. These results are consistent with the light switch mechanism for the action of AraC, refine the model, and extend the range of experimental tests to which it has been subjected.
8687393	Trout red blood cell arrestin (TRCarr), a novel member of the arrestin family: cloning, immunoprecipitation and expression of recombinant TRCarr.	Arrestins are cytosolic proteins involved in the desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors. We report the cloning of trout red blood cell arrestin which shows 76, 82 and 52% identity with bovine beta-arrestin1, beta-arrestin2 and retinal arrestin respectively. Antibodies were generated against the C-terminus of trout red blood cell arrestin. These antibodies detected arrestin in erythrocyte cytosol and were able to precipitate the native protein. The Na+/H+ antiporter of trout red blood cell is activated by beta-adrenergic stimulation and is then desensitized whereas the transmembrane signalling pathway is not. To investigate the subcellular distribution of arrestin on beta-adrenergic activation and desensitization of the antiporter, precipitation experiments were carried out on trout erythrocytes. A desensitization-dependent shift in cytosolic arrestin to the membranes could not be detected using the immunoprecipitation technique but we cannot exclude the possibility that a small number of cytosolic arrestins might be involved in the regulation of membrane proteins in trout erythrocyte. Recombinant trout arrestin was produced in a protease-deficient Escherichia coli strain and its functionality was tested in a reconstituted rhodopsin assay. The recombinant protein provides a suitable tool for investigating the target for arrestin in trout red blood cell, which still remains to be identified.
9892496	Binding of lithium and boron to human plasma proteins.	The binding of lithium and boron, at normal physiological levels, to plasma proteins has been investigated by the techniques of precipitation with ethyl alcohol and gel chromatography. Assays of lithium and boron were made by thermal neutron activation and mass spectrometric assay of 3He and 4He. Results of alcohol precipitation experiments for plasma from two apparently healthy donors showed that 13+/-4% and 16+/-3% of the lithium in plasma is protein bound, but essentially no boron is bound under the conditions used. We believe that because of denaturation of proteins which occurs during alcohol precipitation, these percentages represent lithium and boron tightly bound to protein molecules. The results of the gel-chromatography experiment, on the other hand, showed that lithium and boron are bound to a wide range of plasma proteins, from low (approximately 60,000 amu) to high (approximately 1,000,000 amu) molecular weights, and to very low- (approximately 6000 amu) molecular-weight ligands. Although a clear identification of the specific proteins which bind lithium and boron cannot be made at present, some possibilities can be suggested.
12370086	A short purification process for quantitative isolation of PrPSc from naturally occurring and experimental transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.	BACKGROUND: Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are neurodegenerative diseases affecting both humans and animals. They are associated with post-translational conversion of the normal cellular prion protein (PrPC) into a heat- and protease-resistant abnormal isoform (PrPSc). Detection of PrPSc in individuals is widely utilized for the diagnosis of prion diseases. METHODS: TSE brain tissue samples have been processed in order to quantitatively isolate PrPSc. The protocol includes an initial homogenization, digestion with proteinase K and salt precipitation. RESULTS: Here we show that over 97 percent of the PrPSc present can be precipitated from infected brain material using this simple salting-out procedure for proteins. No chemically harsh conditions are used during the process in order to conserve the native quality of the isolated protein. CONCLUSION: The resulting PrPSc-enriched preparation should provide a suitable substrate for analyzing the structure of the prion agent and for scavenging for other molecules with which it may associate. In comparison with most methods that exist today, the one described in this study is rapid, cost-effective and does not demand expensive laboratory equipment.
12727200	Vitamin D-dependent recruitment of DNA-PK to the chromatinized negative vitamin D response element in the PTHrP gene is required for gene repression by vitamin D.	The mechanism of transcriptional repression by nuclear hormone receptors, especially in the presence of the ligands, is largely unknown. We previously reported that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25 vitamin D3) inhibited expression of the parathyroid hormone-related polypeptide (PTHrP) gene through the interaction between the liganded monomeric vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the negative DNA element in the PTHrP gene (nVDRE(RP)). In this study, we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and confirmed that 1,25 vitamin D3 recruited DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) to the chromatinized nVDRE(RP). Conversely, the regulatory subunits of DNA-PK were associated with the nVDRE(RP) sequences only when 1,25 vitamin D3 was absent. VDR was constitutively associated with these chromatinized nVDRE(RP) sequences. Furthermore, DNA-PKcs could phosphorylate VDR in vitro. We raise a possibility that a conformational change of VDR through its phosphorylation mediated by DNA-PKcs underlies the mechanism of gene repression by 1,25 vitamin D3-bound VDR.
11604407	Characterization of nucleophosmin (B23) as a Myc target by scanning chromatin immunoprecipitation.	The genetic program through which a specific transcription factor regulates a biological response is fundamental to our understanding how instructions in the genome are implemented. The emergence of DNA microarray technology for gene expression analysis has generated vast numbers of target genes resulting from specific transcription factor activity. We use the oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc as proof-of-principle that human genome sequence analysis and scanning of a specific gene by chromatin immunoprecipitation can be coupled to identify target transcription factor binding sequences. We focused on nucleophosmin, also known as B23, which was identified as a candidate Myc-responsive gene from a subtractive hybridization screen, and we found that sequences in intron 1, and not 5' sequences in the proximal promoter, are bound by c-Myc in vivo. Hence, a scanning chromatin immunoprecipitation (SChIP) strategy is useful in analyzing functional transcription factor-binding sites.
11950942	Regulated disruption of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans reveals new functions in feeding and embryogenesis.	"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) is an important second messenger in animal cells and is central to a wide range of cellular responses. The major intracellular activity of IP(3) is to regulate release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores through IP(3) receptors (IP(3)Rs). We describe a system for the transient disruption of IP(3) signaling in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. The IP(3) binding domain of the C. elegans IP(3)R, ITR-1, was expressed from heat shock-induced promoters in live animals. This results in a dominant-negative effect caused by the overexpressed IP(3) binding domain acting as an IP(3) ""sponge."" Disruption of IP(3) signaling resulted in disrupted defecation, a phenotype predicted by previous genetic studies. This approach also identified two new IP(3)-mediated processes. First, the up-regulation of pharyngeal pumping in response to food is dependent on IP(3) signaling. RNA-mediated interference studies and analysis of itr-1 mutants show that this process is also IP(3)R dependent. Second, the tissue-specific expression of the dominant-negative construct enabled us to circumvent the sterility associated with loss of IP(3) signaling through the IP(3)R and thus determine that IP(3)-mediated signaling is required for multiple steps in embryogenesis, including cytokinesis and gastrulation."
12826398	A closer look at long-range chromosomal interactions.	Higher-order chromosome organization is emerging as a major determinant of gene regulation. Although the structure of chromatin at the level of individual nucleosomes has been studied in considerable detail, less is known about higher levels of organization. Two new methods have been developed that can be used to obtain detailed information about the higher-order folding of chromatin. Using these methods, long-range looping interactions have been shown to occur upon activation of the murine beta-globin locus, explaining the long-standing question of how gene regulatory elements can act at large genomic distances from their target genes.
9279386	Characterization of mouse cellular deoxyribonucleic acid homologous to Abelson murine leukemia virus-specific sequences.	The genome of Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) consists of sequences derived from both BALB/c mouse deoxyribonucleic acid and the genome of Moloney murine leukemia virus. Using deoxyribonucleic acid linear intermediates as a source of retroviral deoxyribonucleic acid, we isolated a recombinant plasmid which contained 1.9 kilobases of the 3.5-kilobase mouse-derived sequences found in A-MuLV (A-MuLV-specific sequences). We used this clone, designated pSA-17, as a probe restriction enzyme and Southern blot analyses to examine the arrangement of homologous sequences in BALB/c deoxyribonucleic acid (endogenous Abelson sequences). The endogenous Abelson sequences within the mouse genome were interrupted by noncoding regions, suggesting that a rearrangement of the cell sequences was required to produce the sequence found in the virus. Endogenous Abelson sequences were arranged similarly in mice that were susceptible to A-MuLV tumors and in mice that were resistant to A-MuLV tumors. An examination of three BALB/c plasmacytomas and a BALB/c early B-cell tumor likewise revealed no alteration in the arrangement of the endogenous Abelson sequences. Homology to pSA-17 was also observed in deoxyribonucleic acids prepared from rat, hamster, chicken, and human cells. An isolate of A-MuLV which encoded a 160,000-dalton transforming protein (P160) contained 700 more base pairs of mouse sequences than the standard A-MuLV isolate, which encoded a 120,000-dalton transforming protein (P120).
9570398	Mutational analysis of the NH2-terminal arms of the trp repressor indicates a multifunctional domain.	The NH2-terminal arms of the Escherichia coli trp repressor have been implicated in three functions: formation of repressor-operator complexes via association with non-operator DNA; stabilization of repressor oligomers bound to DNA; and oligomerization of the aporepressor in the absence of DNA. To begin to examine the structural aspects of the arms that are responsible for these varied activities, we generated an extensive set of deletion and substitution mutants and measured the activities of these mutants in vivo using reporter gene fusions. Deletion of any part of the arms resulted in a significant decrease in repressor activity at both the trp and the trpR operons. Positions 4, 5 and 6 were the most sensitive to missense changes. Most substitutions at these positions resulted in repressors with less than 5% of the activity of the wild-type trp repressor. A large percentage of the missense mutants were more active than the wild-type repressor in medium containing tryptophan and less active in medium without tryptophan. This phenotype can be explained in terms of altered oligomerization of both the repressor and the aporepressor. Also, nine super-repressor mutants, resulting from substitutions clustered at both ends of the arms, were found. Our results support the hypothesis that the NH2-terminal arm of the trp repressor is a multifunctional domain and reveal structural components likely to be involved in the various functions.
11408875	The presence of hepatitis B surface antigen and deoxyribonucleic acid in amniotic fluid and cord blood.	OBJECTIVE: It is uncertain whether neonatal infection with hepatitis B, despite treatment after delivery with immunoglobulin and vaccine, is the result of prior in utero transmission of the virus or treatment failure. Furthermore, the potential risk of hepatitis B transmission from the mother to the fetus at the time a genetic amniocentesis is performed is also a concern. In an attempt to better elucidate these controversies, amniotic fluid and cord blood specimens obtained from pregnant women positive for hepatitis B surface antigen were analyzed for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B deoxyribonucleic acid. STUDY DESIGN: This study was a prospective longitudinal analysis that identified hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients who presented for amniocentesis. Cord blood was obtained from these patients at the time of delivery. Cord blood was also obtained from a group of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients for whom no amniocentesis was performed. All samples were analyzed for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B deoxyribonucleic acid. RESULTS: A total of 121 hepatitis B surface antigen-positive pregnant women were identified. In the 72 pregnancies in which amniocentesis was not performed, 18% of the cord blood samples were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen and 4% were positive for hepatitis B deoxyribonucleic acid. Of 47 amniocentesis fluid samples, 32% were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen but all were negative for hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid. Of 30 cord blood samples from patients who underwent an amniocentesis, 27% were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, but all were negative for hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that hepatitis B viral deoxyribonucleic acid is rarely present in cord blood and was not identified in amniotic fluid obtained by amniocentesis. This finding suggests that in utero transmission of the virus is rare prior to the onset of labor. These data further confirm the reports in the current literature that the risk of hepatitis B transmission to the fetus during amniocentesis is low. Because hepatitis B surface antigen can exist as an isolated entity devoid of nuclear material, in some cases this protein may be able to traverse the placental and amniotic membrane barrier in a manner similar to other proteins, such as alpha-fetoprotein. Recommendations for genetic amniocentesis in women positive for hepatitis B surface antigen are discussed.
11596921	Quantitation of Cryptosporidium parvum infection in cell culture using a colorimetric in situ hybridization assay.	A quantitative colorimetric in situ hybridization assay was developed for detecting Cryptosporidium parvum infection in cell cultures using a digoxigenin-labeled probe targeting 18S rRNA. Intra-cellular developmental stages of C. parvum such as trophozoites and meronts were clearly discerned by light microscopy as localized areas of dark purple/black precipitate against a colorless background. Infections developed focally and the term infectious focus was applied to each cluster of developmental stages. There were no significant differences in the number of infectious foci following 24 h or 48 h incubation. However, 24 h and 48 h dose response curves were significantly different when infectivity was measured as the number of developmental stages per monolayer, with an average of 5.3-fold more stages following 48 h incubation. When infectivity was expressed as the number of infectious foci per inoculum oocyst converted to a percentage, it was demonstrated that the rate of infection decreased with increasing oocyst age. Oocysts of the Iowa isolate that were 7-10 days old demonstrated 7.8+/-2.4% infectivity (mean +/- standard deviation) compared to 4.2+/-0.8% for 21-28 day-old oocysts and 1.4+/-1.3% for 42-70 day-old oocysts. The assay also detected infection with other genotype 2 oocysts and a genoptye 1 isolate. This assay provides a direct quantitative approach for measuring C. parvum infectivity in cell culture.
11953323	Specific interaction of IP6 with human Ku70/80, the DNA-binding subunit of DNA-PK.	In eukaryotic cells, DNA double-strand breaks can be repaired by non-homologous end-joining, a process dependent upon Ku70/80, XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV. In mammals, this process also requires DNA-PK(cs), the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase DNA-PK. Previously, inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) was shown to be bound by DNA-PK and to stimulate DNA-PK-dependent end-joining in vitro. Here, we localize IP6 binding to the Ku70/80 subunits of DNA- PK, and show that DNA-PK(cs) alone exhibits no detectable affinity for IP6. Moreover, proteolysis mapping of Ku70/80 in the presence and absence of IP6 indicates that binding alters the conformation of the Ku70/80 heterodimer. The yeast homologue of Ku70/80, yKu70/80, fails to bind IP6, indicating that the function of IP6 in non-homologous end-joining, like that of DNA-PK(cs), is unique to the mammalian end-joining process.
12097194	Thyroglobulin in orbital tissues from patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy: predominant localization in fibroadipose tissue.	UNLABELLED: One of the hypotheses that explains the pathogenesis of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is that thyroglobulin (Tg) is transported through a retrograde lymphatic route to orbital tissues (OT), where it elicits autoimmune damage. In a previous study we demonstrated the presence of intact Tg of thyroid origin in OT from three patients with TAO. The present study was undertaken to investigate this issue further, by increasing the number of patients, by analyzing the distribution of Tg in OT, and by investigating possible relations between the presence of Tg in OT and the clinical features of patients. OT was obtained from seven patients with TAO who underwent decompressive orbitotomy via a transpalpebral approach. Patients were designated P10 to P16. Inflamed palpebral skin, retrobulbar fibroadipose tissue and extraocular muscle surgical samples were collected separately. Tissue extracts were prepared by homogenization and analyzed for the presence of Tg using two different techniques. We first performed immunoprecipitation experiments, in which a rabbit polyclonal anti-Tg antibody was used to capture Tg on protein A and a mouse monoclonal anti-Tg antibody was used to re-veal captured Tg by Western blotting. Intact 330-kd Tg was detected in retrobulbar fibroadipose tissue extracts from three patients (P10, P11, and P16), whereas no Tg was detected in retrobulbar fibroadipose tissue extracts from the remaining four patients. Tg was not detected in the extraocular muscle extracts from all patients studied. In addition, intact 330-kd Tg was found in the inflamed palpebral skin extract from one patient (P10). No Tg was detected in OT extracts from two patients without thyroid or eye disease and in abdominal adipose tissue extracts from two obese patients without thyroid or eye disease. We then searched for Tg by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using the same antibodies used for immunoprecipitation. Tg was detected in retrobulbar fibroadipose tissue extracts from four patients (P10, P11, P12, and P16) and in the inflamed palpebral skin extract from patient P10, in amounts ranging from approximately 125 to approximately 400 pg/microg of tissue protein. Again, Tg was not detected in extraocular muscle extracts. A positive gradient between Tg in OT and Tg in the serum was observed in patient P12. Using an ELISA approach, we found that Tg in OT from three TAO patients (P10, P11, and P12) contained thyroxine (T4) residues (mean T(4) CONTENT: 2.42 molecules per molecule of Tg), indicating that Tg had originated in the thyroid. Combining the results obtained in our previous and present study, we found a possible relation between the presence of Tg in OT and the previous treatment with radioiodine. Thus, of the seven patients (3 in the previous and 4 in the present study) in whose OT Tg was found, six had been treated with radioiodine, whereas of the three patients with no Tg in their OT none had been treated with radioiodine. In conclusion, Tg was found in OT extracts from patients with TAO by immunoprecipitation in three of seven cases and by ELISA in four of seven cases. Tg was found in retrobulbar fibroadipose tissue, but not in extraocular muscles. There was a relation between the presence of Tg in OT and the previous treatment with radioiodine. Our results support the hypothesis that Tg may play a role as a coantigen in the pathogenesis of TAO. Further studies are needed to investigate this possibility.
7614681	Appearance of artefacts when using 32P-postlabelling to investigate DNA adduct formation by bile acids in vitro: lack of evidence for covalent binding.	We reported (Scates et al. Carcinogenesis 1994, 15, 2945-2948) that incubating a range of bile acids with DNA in vitro, with or without exogenous metabolic activation, gave no evidence of DNA adduct formation as judged by the nuclease P1 method of 32P-postlabelling. In contrast Hamada et al. (Carcinogenesis 1994, 15, 1911-1915), also using postlabelling, claimed that chenodeoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, glycolithocholic acid and taurolithocholic acid bound covalently to DNA in vitro. To investigate this discordance we incubated solutions of salmon sperm DNA for 1 h at 37 degrees C with 1 mg/ml of cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, glycolithocholic acid or taurolithocholic acid. Each incubate was extracted extensively with diethyl ether after which a sample of DNA was taken and 32P-postlabelled using the nuclease P1 method. The DNA in the remaining incubate was precipitated from high salt solution with ethanol. Aliquots of this DNA were postlabelled. The remainder of the DNA was purified with proteinase-K, ribonuclease, phenol-chloroform, precipitated and postlabelled. Parallel incubates were made with the same bile acids, under the same conditions but in the absence of DNA and were then extracted, precipitated and postlabelled as described above. When DNA was present in the incubate but was not precipitated, chenodeoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, glycolithocholic acid and taurolithocholic acid, but not cholic acid, produced spots similar to those reported by Hamada et al. No such spots were seen when DNA was postlabelled after precipitation, or after precipitation and purification. These same bile acids produced spots when postlabelled in the absence of DNA, but spots were absent when these incubates were precipitated and purified before postlabelling. We conclude that the spots obtained when bile acids are incubated with DNA which is not precipitated from high salt before it is postlabelled are technical artefacts, and cannot be regarded as evidence that bile acids bind covalently to DNA to form adducts. We also confirm reports (Vulimiri et al. Carcinogenesis 1994, 15, 2061-2064) that bile acids alone can produce spots when incubated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [gamma-32P]ATP.
9461448	Direct cloning of DNA that interacts in vivo with a specific protein: application to RNA polymerase II and sites of pausing in Drosophila.	A new method is described for cloning DNA sequences occupied by a specific protein on chromatin in vivo . The approach uses UV cross-linking to couple proteins covalently to DNA and the resulting complexes are then purified under stringent conditions. Particular adducts are immunoprocipitated with antibody to the protein of interest. The resulting DNA (iDNA) is amplified by PCR, cloned and characterized. The model system used was RNA polymerase II (Pol II), whose density on particular DNAs under various conditions is well documented. Pol II can exist in several states on DNA. While Pol II can simply be bound to DNA, the bulk of DNA-associated Pol II is transcriptionally engaged in either the transcribing or paused states. Paused Pol IIs that have previously been characterized are found at promoters and have the distinctive property that their transcription in isolated nuclei is stimulated by sarkosyl or high salt. Here we isolate and sequence DNAs that cross-link to Pol II molecules. We identify by nuclear run-on assays those DNAs that have Pol II engaged in transcription. Twenty one percent of the iDNA clones that have detectable transcriptionally engaged Pol II appear to be paused, in that they display sarkosyl-stimulated trancription in a nuclear run-on transcription assay. At least some of these map to the 5'-ends of genes. These results suggest that transcriptional pausing of Pol II is a general phenomenon in vivo.
10588233	Pravastatin restored the infarct size-limiting effect of ischemic preconditioning blunted by hypercholesterolemia in the rabbit model of myocardial infarction.	OBJECTIVES: We tested to find out whether pravastatin restores the infarct size (IS)-limiting effect of ischemic preconditioning (IP) and if it has any effect on the IP-induced activation of adenosine producing enzyme ecto-5'-nucleotidase which plays a key role in the IP-induced cardioprotection. BACKGROUND: The IS-limiting effect of IP is blunted by hypercholesterolemia. Recently, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are shown to have direct cytoprotective effects. METHODS: Rabbits were fed with a normal or cholesterol (1%) added diet with or without pravastatin (5 mg/kg/day) treatment. Infarct size was measured after 30 min occlusion and 3 h reperfusion of circumflex coronary artery with or without the IP procedure (5 min occlusion and 10 min reperfusion). Additionally, ecto-5'-nucleotidase activities of ischemic and nonischemic myocardium were measured immediately after IP procedure. RESULTS: This dose of pravastatin did not normalize the increased level of serum cholesterol. The IS-limiting effect of preceding IP (IS reduced from 36.7% to 9.6%, p < 0.001) was abolished by hypercholesterolemia (from 46.1% to 31.3%, p = NS) and restored by pravastatin treatment (from 35.2% to 9.4%, p < 0.001). Pravastatin treatment did not affect IS or the effect of IP under normocholesterolemia. The activation of ecto-5'-nucleotidase presented as the activity ratio of ischemic to nonischemic myocardium (3.1-fold in normocholesterolemia) was blunted by hypercholesterolemia (1.8-fold, p < 0.05) and restored by pravastatin treatment (2.9-fold). CONCLUSIONS: Pravastatin, at the dose serum cholesterol was not normalized, restored the IS-limiting effect of IP and IP-induced ecto-5'-nucleotidase activation, which were both blunted by hypercholesterolemia. The activation of ecto-5'-nucleotidase may be worth further investigation as a possible mechanism for the hypercholesterolemia-induced retardation and pravastatin-mediated restoration of the cardioprotective effect of IP.
10942306	Isoelectric precipitation of soybean protein using carbon dioxide as a volatile acid.	A novel process is presented for the isoelectric precipitation of soy protein, using carbon dioxide as a volatile acid. By contacting a soy meal extract with pressurized carbon dioxide, the solution pH was decreased to the isoelectric region of the soy proteins. Complete precipitation of the precipitable soy proteins could be achieved for protein concentrations up to 40 g/l at pressures less than 50 bar. Isoelectric precipitation with a volatile acid enabled accurate control of the solution pH by pressure and eliminated the local pH overshoot, usual in conventional precipitation techniques. The advantage of the improved precipitation control was reflected by the morphology of the precipitate particles. Protein aggregates formed by CO2 were perfectly spherical whereas protein precipitated by sulfuric acid had an irregular morphology. The influence of process variables to control particle size is discussed.
10947120	Spin transfer from protein to DNA in X-irradiated 'dry' and hydrated chromatin: an electron spin resonance investigation of spectral components between 77 K and room temperature.	PURPOSE: To investigate the potential total and relative free-radical transfer from histones to DNA in X-irradiated chromatin, by analysing the relative contributions of individual radicals from protein and from DNA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chromatin was isolated from calf thymus, freeze-dried and either used as such or after equilibration at 76% relative humidity. A mixture of histones was purchased. X-irradiation was performed at 77 K (liquid nitrogen). Data acquisition was on a Bruker ESP 380 ESR-spectrometer (X-band, 9.5 GHz) and at high magnetic fields (285 GHz, Y-band, GHMFL Grenoble). Data analysis involved computer treatment of spectra. RESULTS: Three components were isolated from an annealing series of histones and assigned to specific radicals (X-band). Chromatin revealed the existence of radicals from both DNA, as well as from the histone compartment. The presence of the oxidized guanine base, as well as the reduced cytosine and thymine bases from DNA at 77 K was confirmed by high-field ESR. Relative radical yields were determined by superposition of individual components from DNA and histones in order to give complete reconstructions of the experimental spectra of the annealing series. CONCLUSIONS: The relative yields of individual radicals in chromatin differ from those in histones or DNA, respectively. Their behaviour upon annealing is, on the other hand, not significantly changed. Since the total radical yield of DNA radicals is about two times higher in the chromatin complex than in pure DNA, the hypothesis of spin transfer from protein to DNA prior to radical stabilization at 77 K is substantiated.
8034988	Cloning of an antibody binding DNA sequence: pitfalls of DNA/protein immunoprecipitation reactions.	This paper presents evidence of cross-reactivity of a normal genomic DNA sequence to a number of antibodies raised against common proteins. This DNA fragment was inadvertently isolated during DNA-protein immunoprecipitation cloning experiments and was found to bind not only to the antibody used in the immunoprecipitation experiment, but to several different antibodies in gel-shift assays. This data demonstrates the ability of certain DNA sequences to bind non-specifically to antibodies and highlights the danger of DNA/antibody binding which can produce artifacts. Possible means of overcoming these reactions are discussed.
8166201	Expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 messenger ribonucleic acid and the modulation of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis by transforming growth factor-beta 1 in human endometrial cells.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was (1) to evaluate the potential sites of transforming growth factor-beta 1 synthesis in human endometrium by analyzing separated endometrial glands and stromal cells for transforming growth factor-beta 1 messenger ribonucleic acid by Northern analysis of total ribonucleic acid and (2) to investigate the effects of transforming growth factor-beta 1 on deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in endometrial epithelial and stromal cells in culture. STUDY DESIGN: Endometrial glands and stroma from proliferative and secretory endometrium were isolated after collagenase treatment of endometrial tissue minces and were analyzed for transforming growth factor-beta 1 messenger ribonucleic acid by Northern analysis. We studied the effects of estradiol-17 beta and transforming growth factor-beta 1 on deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in endometrial epithelium and transforming growth factor-beta 1 on stromal cells in culture by evaluating tritiated thymidine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material. RESULTS: Transforming growth factor-beta 1 messenger ribonucleic acid was detected for Northern analysis in separated endometrial stromal cells in levels that were greatest during the secretory phase and in greater levels than in epithelial cells from that same tissue. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 messenger ribonucleic acid in glandular epithelium in culture was not increased to detectable levels by treatment with transforming growth factor-beta 1. Deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in endometrial glandular epithelium was inhibited by transforming growth factor-beta 1, but transforming growth factor-beta 1 stimulated deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in endometrial stromal cells in culture. After treatment for 5 days with estradiol-17 beta (10(-8) mol/L), deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in endometrial glands in culture was decreased by 40%. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (1 ng/ml) did not alter this effect of estradiol-17 beta on deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Transforming growth factor-beta 1 acts to decrease deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in epithelial cells and to increase it in stromal cells isolated from human endometrium and maintained in monolayer culture. Transforming growth factor-beta 1, potentially of stromal cell origin, could participate in the regulation of endometrial cell proliferation and differentiation in vivo.
8519984	Estimating friction coefficients of mixed globular/chain molecules, such as protein/DNA complexes.	Existing methods for predicting translational friction properties of complex molecules start by explicitly building up their three-dimensional shape with spherical subunits. This treatment has been used especially for two types of systems: rigid assemblies and flexible chain molecules. However, many protein/DNA complexes such as chromatin consist of a small number of globular, relatively rigid, bound protein interspersed by long stretches of flexible DNA chain. I present a higher level of treatment of such macromolecules that avoids explicit subunit modeling as much as possible. An existing analytical formulation of the hydrodynamics equations is shown to be accurate when used with the present treatment. Thus the approach is fast and can be applied to hydrodynamic studies of highly degenerate multiple equilibria, such as those encountered in problems of the regulation of chromatin structure. I demonstrate the approach by predicting the effect of a hypothetical unwinding process in dinucleosomes and by simulating the distribution of sedimentation coefficients for cooperative and random models for a chromatin saturation process.
8650542	Dimerization of TFIID when not bound to DNA.	For unknown reasons, the eukaryotic transcription factor TFIID inefficiently recognizes promoters. Human TFIID was found to form highly specific homodimers that must dissociate before DNA binding. TFIID dimers formed through self-association of the TATA-binding polypeptide (TBP) subunit and could be immunoprecipitated with antibodies to TAF(II)250, the core subunit of TFIID. Chemical cross-linking experiments in HeLa cells revealed the presence of TBP dimers in vivo. These findings suggest that dimerization through TBP is the physiological state of TFIID when not bound to DNA. Thus, the inefficiency of TFIID binding to a promoter may be partly attributable to the competitive effect of dimerization.
10209116	A DNA unwinding factor involved in DNA replication in cell-free extracts of Xenopus eggs.	BACKGROUND: Alteration of chromatin structure is a key step in various aspects of DNA metabolism. DNA unwinding factors such as the high mobility group (HMG) proteins are thought to play a general role in controlling chromatin structure and a specific role in controlling DNA replication. For instance, in the in vitro simian virus 40 replication system, minichromosomes containing HMG-17 replicate more efficiently than those without it, suggesting that HMG-17 enhances the rate of replication of a chromatin template by unfolding the higher-order chromatin structure. At present, however, only limited data suggest an involvement of DNA unwinding factors in DNA replication. RESULTS: We purified from Xenopus eggs a novel heterodimeric factor, termed DNA unwinding factor (DUF), that consists of 87 kDa and 140 kDa polypeptides. DUF unwinds closed-circular duplex DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I, but it does not possess a DNA gyrase activity: it does not introduce negative supercoils into DNA at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. Cloning and sequencing of the cDNAs encoding the two polypeptides revealed that the 87 kDa polypeptide is homologous to a mammalian HMG protein, T160/structure-specific recognition protein. The 140 kDa polypeptide is homologous to yeast Cdc68, a protein that controls the expression of several genes during the G1 phase of the cell cycle by modulating chromatin structure. Immunodepletion of DUF from Xenopus egg extracts drastically reduced the ability of the extract to replicate exogenously added sperm chromatin or plasmid DNA. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that DUF plays a role in DNA replication in Xenopus egg extracts.
11746496	Identification of proteins that interact with BRCA1 by Far-Western library screening.	Protein-protein interactions control numerous biological processes. In the case of a protein with no known function, identification of interacting proteins may lend insight into its cellular function. Protein-protein interactions are often detected by yeast two-hybrid screening which is based on a transcriptional read-out. One limitation of this technique is that transcription factors, when used as bait, frequently impair the effectiveness of this screen because they give rise to high levels of false positives. The carboxyl terminus of the breast cancer tumor suppressor gene, BRCA1, contains two BRCT motifs, a motif found in several DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint proteins. This region of BRCA1 also exhibits an intrinsic transcriptional transactivation activity when bound to DNA as a fusion protein, thereby limiting its use in yeast two-hybrid screen. In order to isolate proteins that interact with this domain of BRCA1, we utilized a Far-Western screen, a method based on direct protein binding. We used recombinant histidine-tagged BRCT as the primary protein probe. We isolated eight cDNAs that bind to the BRCT domain of BRCA1. Further analysis demonstrated that two of the clones encode for proteins that interact directly with the BRCT domain of BRCA1.
11751634	Histone H3 lysine 4 methylation is mediated by Set1 and required for cell growth and rDNA silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	Histone methylation is known to be associated with both transcriptionally active and repressive chromatin states. Recent studies have identified SET domain-containing proteins such as SUV39H1 and Clr4 as mediators of H3 lysine 9 (Lys9) methylation and heterochromatin formation. Interestingly, H3 Lys9 methylation is not observed from bulk histones isolated from asynchronous populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Tetrahymena thermophila. In contrast, H3 lysine 4 (Lys4) methylation is a predominant modification in these smaller eukaryotes. To identify the responsible methyltransferase(s) and to gain insight into the function of H3 Lys4 methylation, we have developed a histone H3 Lys4 methyl-specific antiserum. With this antiserum, we show that deletion of SET1, but not of other putative SET domain-containing genes, in S. cerevisiae, results in the complete abolishment of H3 Lys4 methylation in vivo. Furthermore, loss of H3 Lys4 methylation in a set1 Delta strain can be rescued by SET1. Analysis of histone H3 mutations at Lys4 revealed a slow-growth defect similar to a set1 Delta strain. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that H3 Lys4 methylation is present at the rDNA locus and that Set1-mediated H3 Lys4 methylation is required for repression of RNA polymerase II transcription within rDNA. Taken together, these data suggest that Set1-mediated H3 Lys4 methylation is required for normal cell growth and transcriptional silencing.
7517679	Antibodies specific for the neuronal form of the Src protein elicited by an antigenized antibody.	To elicit antibodies directed specifically against the neuron-specific form of the c-src gene product, pp60c-src(+), we used an antigenized antibody comprising a decamer containing the amino acid sequence specific to pp60c-src(+) inserted into the third hypervariable loop of the heavy (H)-chain variable (V)-region. This was used to raise anti-idiotype antibodies reacting with the peptide epitope in rabbits. The antisera reacted with pp60c-src(+), as judged by immune blotting, immunoprecipitation, immune complex kinase assay, and indirect immunofluorescence staining, but did not react with the fibroblast form of the c-src gene product, pp60c-src. Antigenized antibody is a useful approach for producing antibodies able to distinguish between isoforms of the same gene product and specific for the neuronal form of the Src protein.
7621866	Preferential recognition of specific DNA motifs by anti-double-stranded DNA autoantibodies.	Although antibodies (Ab) specific for double-stranded (ds) DNA are thought to be involved in the etiopathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the fine structure of their DNA targets remains elusive. We have adapted a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-assisted immunoprecipitation method to define the binding sites in DNA sequences recognized by high affinity anti-dsDNA Ab of SLE patients. SLE sera were used to bind templates from a pool of double-stranded oligonucleotides (ON). A central part of 20 base-pair random sequence was flanked by restriction endonuclease recognition sites and sequences complementary to predefined PCR primers. Immunoselected ON were precipitated, isolated from the immune complexes and then subjected to a further immunoprecipitation step after amplification by PCR. After five cycles of immunoprecipitation and PCR, the resulting ON were cloned. Sequence analysis revealed that sera from SLE patients and two human monoclonal anti-dsDNA Ab obtained from SLE patients preferentially select sequences expected to form non-B-DNA structures. Inhibition studies of the Farr assay confirmed the increased affinity of the selected epitopes for anti-DNA Ab as compared to random B-DNA.
8974015	Chromatin structure and the regulation of gene expression: remodeling at the MMTV promoter.	The role of the various levels of chromatin organization in the control of eukaryotic gene expression is discussed on the basis of recent advances in our understanding of chromatin structure in well-defined model systems. Particular attention is devoted to the precise structure and the possible functions of positioned nucleosomes and to the enzymatic mechanism of nucleosome remodeling. Some of the principles involved are illustrated with genomic footprinting results obtained with the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter, the nucleosomal organization of which is remodeled following transcriptional induction by steroid hormones. In this system a positioned nucleosome is responsible for transcriptional repression prior to hormone administration and participates in hormonal induction by facilitating the functional interaction among transcription factors on the promoter.
10319870	Maintenance of genomic methylation requires a SWI2/SNF2-like protein.	Altering cytosine methylation by genetic means leads to a variety of developmental defects in mice, plants and fungi. Deregulation of cytosine methylation also has a role in human carcinogenesis. In some cases, these defects have been tied to the inheritance of epigenetic alterations (such as chromatin imprints and DNA methylation patterns) that do not involve changes in DNA sequence. Using a forward genetic screen, we identified a gene (DDM1, decrease in DNA methylation) from the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana required to maintain normal cytosine methylation patterns. Additional ddm1 alleles (som4, 5, 6, 7, 8) were isolated in a selection for mutations that relieved transgene silencing (E.J.R., unpublished data). Loss of DDM1 function causes a 70% reduction of genomic cytosine methylation, with most of the immediate hypomethylation occurring in repeated sequences. In contrast, many low-copy sequences initially retain their methylation in ddm1 homozygotes, but lose methylation over time as the mutants are propagated through multiple generations by self-pollination. The progressive effect of ddm1 mutations on low-copy sequence methylation suggests that ddm1 mutations compromise the efficiency of methylation of newly incorporated cytosines after DNA replication. In parallel with the slow decay of methylation during inbreeding, ddm1 mutants accumulate heritable alterations (mutations or stable epialleles) at dispersed sites in the genome that lead to morphological abnormalities. Here we report that DDM1 encodes a SWI2/SNF2-like protein, implicating chromatin remodelling as an important process for maintenance of DNA methylation and genome integrity.
11275546	Participation of histones and histone-modifying enzymes in cell functions through alterations in chromatin structure.	Alterations in the chromatin structure are preferentially involved in the regulation of cell functions, including gene expression, in eukaryotes. Three types of mechanisms, by which the alterations are caused have been reported: (i) variants of histone subtypes, (ii) chromatin remodeling, and (iii) post-translational modification. This review focuses mainly on the first and third mechanisms, especially on the acetylation of core histones, one of the third mechanisms. Using the gene targeting technique for the DT40 chicken B cell line, we systematically generated a number of mutants, respectively, devoid of particular genes encoding histones and histone deacetylase(s) (HDACs). Most of the H1 and core histone variants should be involved positively or negatively in the transcription regulation of particular genes. Of the chicken HDACs (chHDACs), chHDAC-2 controls the amount of the IgM H-chain at the steps of both transcription and alternative pre-mRNA processing, and chHDAC-3 is essential for cell viability, whereas chHDAC-1 merely affects gene expression in DT40 cells. These results indicate that HDAC family members should participate, in combination with one another, and/or histone acetyltransferase(s) (HATs), in the acetylation of core histones that regulates gene expression through alterations in the chromatin structure.
12660172	Chromosomal protein HMGN1 enhances the rate of DNA repair in chromatin.	We report that HMGN1, a nucleosome binding protein that destabilizes the higher-order chromatin structure, modulates the repair rate of ultraviolet light (UV)-induced DNA lesions in chromatin. Hmgn1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are hypersensitive to UV, and the removal rate of photoproducts from the chromatin of Hmgn1(-/-) MEFs is decreased as compared with the chromatin of Hmgn1(+/+) MEFs; yet, host cell reactivation assays and DNA array analysis indicate that the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway in the Hmgn1(-/-) MEFs remains intact. The UV hypersensitivity of Hmgn1(-/-) MEFs could be rescued by transfection with plasmids expressing wild-type HMGN1 protein, but not with plasmids expressing HMGN1 mutants that do not bind to nucleosomes or do not unfold chromatin. Transcriptionally active genes, the main target of the NER pathways in mice, contain HMGN1 protein, and loss of HMGN1 protein reduces the accessibility of transcribed genes to nucleases. By reducing the compaction of the higher-order chromatin structure, HMGN1 facilitates access to UV-damaged DNA sites and enhances the rate of DNA repair in chromatin.
8619478	N,N'-bis[3,3'-(dimethylamino)propylamine]-3,4,9, 10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide, a dicationic perylene dye for rapid precipitation and quantitation of trace amounts of DNA.	"A novel dicationic dye with a polycyclic aromatic perylene core and flexible cationic side chains- N,N'-bis[3, 3'-(dimethylamino)propylamine]-3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide-termed ""DAPER,"" was synthesized and characterized. The dye appears to exist in a highly stacked form in aqueous solution. DAPER precipitates extremely low concentrations of DNA very rapidly, efficiently, and with a stoichiometry of one tightly bound dye per DNA base pair, corresponding to a neutral complex. Precipitation may occur due to side-by-side association between the polyanionic DNA helix and polycationic dye stacks. DNA precipitation by DAPER is less sensitive to DNA concentration and length, and prevailing salt concentrations, than precipitation with ethanol or propanol. DAPER can be quantitatively extracted from DNA into a standard phenol:chloroform mixture under slightly alkaline conditions. The recovered DNA is suitable for treatment with enzymes typically used in DNA sequencing procedures. The amount of DNA precipitated is accurately determined by visible absorption or fluorescence spectroscopic analyses of the phenol:chloroform extracts. Several samples of DNA can be precipitated, recovered, and quantitated in about 1 h using standard microscale procedures and equipment. The unique qualities of DAPER provide the basis for a very sensitive, rapid, and versatile method for simultaneous precipitation and quantitation of microgram and submicrogram amounts of DNA."
9016770	DNA polymerase epsilon from Drosophila melanogaster.	We identified a DNA polymerase species in Drosophila melanogaster embryos, and purified it. This polymerase shared some common properties with DNA polymerase epsilon from mammals and yeast as follows; it has a preference for poly(dA)/oligo(dT) as a template/primer, it is highly processive in DNA synthesis, it co-fractionates with 3'-5' exonuclease activity, it is sensitive to aphidicolin and is resistance to ddTTP. The polymerase activity was inhibited in the immuno-precipitation assay with anti-pol-epsilon antibodies, which were produced against a polypeptide coded on the cDNA of a putative Drosophila pol-epsilon we isolated previously. Using these antibodies, Western blot analysis revealed that this polymerase is a 250kDa polypeptide, which is the same size as observed in mammals and yeast. These results indicate that Drosophila produces the epsilon-class of DNA polymerase, and like mammals or yeast, possesses the 5 typical classes of DNA polymerases (alpha to epsilon) in its embryos.
12087101	MCM2-7 complexes bind chromatin in a distributed pattern surrounding the origin recognition complex in Xenopus egg extracts.	The MCM2-7 complex is believed to function as the eukaryotic replicative DNA helicase. It is recruited to chromatin by the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1, and it is activated at the G(1)/S transition by Cdc45 and the protein kinases Cdc7 and Cdk2. Paradoxically, the number of chromatin-bound MCM complexes greatly exceeds the number of bound ORC complexes. To understand how the high MCM2-7:ORC ratio comes about, we examined the binding of these proteins to immobilized linear DNA fragments in Xenopus egg extracts. The minimum length of DNA required to recruit ORC and MCM2-7 was approximately 80 bp, and the MCM2-7:ORC ratio on this fragment was approximately 1:1. With longer DNA fragments, the MCM2-7:ORC ratio increased dramatically, indicating that MCM complexes normally become distributed over a large region of DNA surrounding ORC. Only a small subset of the chromatin-bound MCM2-7 complexes recruited Cdc45 at the onset of DNA replication, and unlike Cdc45, MCM2-7 was not limiting for DNA replication. However, all the chromatin-bound MCM complexes may be functional, because they were phosphorylated in a Cdc7-dependent fashion, and because they could be induced to support Cdk2-dependent Cdc45 loading. The data suggest that in Xenopus egg extracts, origins of replication contain multiple, distributed, initiation-competent MCM2-7 complexes.
12205999	[Protective effect of ischemic preconditioning on ischemia-reperfusion injury].	OBJECTIVE: To study the protective effect of ischemic preconditioning(IP) on ischemia-reperfusion injury of limb. METHODS: One to three times of short-term ischemia was applicated before prolonged ischemia, a series of biological examinations, including creatine phosphate kinase(CPK), glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase(GOT), lactic dehydrogenase(LDH), malondiadehyde(MDA) and superoxide dismutase(SOD) were carried out in each group. RESULTS: Compared with the control, release of skeletal muscle intracellular enzyme(CPK, GOT and LDH) decreased in experiment groups after preconditioning had been performed. The serum concentration of MDA was lower, activity of SOD was higher, and pathological lesion was less in preconditioning groups than that in non-preconditioning group. Different frequency of preconditioning led to different results. CONCLUSIONS: Preconditioning has protective effect on ischemia-reperfusion injury of limbs, and the effect of IP is correlated with the number of preconditioning cycles.
12581157	CDK- and Cdc45-dependent priming of the MCM complex on chromatin during S-phase in Xenopus egg extracts: possible activation of MCM helicase by association with Cdc45.	BACKGROUND: MCM and Cdc45 are required for the initiation and elongation stages of eukaryotic DNA replication. Recent studies show that a purified Mcm4/6/7 complex has DNA helicase activity. However, the biochemical function of the MCM complex and Cdc45 bound to chromatin has not been elucidated. RESULTS: We have examined the biochemical properties of MCM proteins bound to chromatin fractions using Xenopus egg extracts. Immunoprecipitation of MCM proteins extracted under denaturing conditions reveals that all six subunits of MCM and Cdc45 form a tight complex following the initiation of DNA replication, and that both CDK activity and Cdc45 are essential for the complex formation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of MCM proteins and Cdc45 shows that a complex containing MCM and Cdc45 has a DNA helicase activity which is dependent on CDK activity and Cdc45 in the extracts. Furthermore, both the complex and the helicase activity are resistant to treatment with phosphatase and high salt. CONCLUSIONS: Following the initiation of DNA replication, a tight MCM-Cdc45 complex is formed on chromatin and its formation is closely correlated with the DNA helicase activity of chromatin immunoprecipitates containing MCM and Cdc45. We propose that the tight MCM-Cdc45 complex functions as a replicative DNA helicase in vivo.
10722661	Isolation of Trypanosoma brucei CYC2 and CYC3 cyclin genes by rescue of a yeast G(1) cyclin mutant. Functional characterization of CYC2.	Two Trypanosoma brucei cyclin genes, CYC2 and CYC3, have been isolated by rescue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant DL1, which is deficient in CLN G(1) cyclin function. CYC2 encodes a 24-kDa protein that has sequence identity to the Neurospora crassa PREG1 and the S. cerevisiae PHO80 cyclin. CYC3 has the most sequence identity to mitotic B-type cyclins from a variety of organisms. Both CYC2 and CYC3 are single-copy genes and expressed in all life cycle stages of the parasite. To determine if CYC2 is found in a complex with previously identified trypanosome cdc2-related kinases (CRKs), the CYC2 gene was fused to the TY epitope tag, integrated into the trypanosome genome, and expressed under inducible control. CYC2ty was found to associate with an active trypanosome CRK complex since CYC2ty bound to leishmanial p12(cks1), and histone H1 kinase activity was detected in CYC2ty immune-precipitated fractions. Gene knockout experiments provide evidence that CYC2 is an essential gene, and co-immune precipitations together with a two-hybrid interaction assay demonstrated that CYC2 interacts with CRK3. The CRK3 x CYC2ty complex, the first cyclin-dependent kinase complex identified in trypanosomes, was localized by immune fluorescence to the cytoplasm throughout the cell cycle.
10723176	[Immuno-histochemical identification of initial lymphatics: the contour and distribution pattern of initial lymphatics in the human foreskin of the penis].	PURPOSE: There has not been an established method to distinguish initial lymphatics from blood capillaries under the light microscopy. In this study, we examined the usefulness of the immuno-histochemical staining method using a monoclonal anti-desmoplakin antibody in identifying initial lymphatics under the light microscopy. The specificity of this reaction was confirmed by the immuno-electron microscopy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The cryostat sections of the human foreskin were observed under light microscopy by indirect immunoperoxidase method with the anti-desmoplakin mouse monoclonal antibody, and compared with the hematoxylin and eosin sections. These cryostat sections were also observed under electron microscopy by pre-embedding immunoperoxidase method with the same antibody. RESULTS: Under the light microscopy, the initial lymphatics of the human foreskin were visualized by the method with anti-desmoplakin antibody. These lymphatics were mainly distributed in the dermal layer, on the other hand, rarely seen in dermal papillae. Being usually found in closed shape, the lumens of initial lymphatics were hardly recognized as initial lymphatics by the ordinary hematoxylin and eosin staining. Under the immuno-transmission electron microscopy, the peroxidase-desmoplakin antibody precipitations were located on the surface of the endothelial cells of the vasculature which lacked pericytes and basal lamina, and was composed of endothelial cells alone. By these features of the vascular structures, the vessel reacting with anti-desmoplakin antibody was identified as initial lymphatics. CONCLUSION: This study shows the reliability and specificity of the immuno-histochemical method by anti-desmoplakin antibody in identifying initial lymphatics under light microscopy, and this method will be useful in studying the fine distribution of lymphatic vessels in normal human tissue.
8134115	Identification and cDNA cloning of single-stranded DNA binding proteins that interact with the region upstream of the human c-myc gene.	We have previously reported that a c-myc protein complex binds to the region upstream of the c-myc gene, where exist an origin of cellular DNA replication (ori) and a transcriptional enhancer. Both functions require a 21 bp long sequence, while the c-myc protein complex recognizes a 7 bp consensus therein. It was recently reported that single-stranded DNA binding proteins bound specifically to sequences that play roles in DNA replication or transcription. We examined for proteins binding to the single-stranded DNAs of the 21 bp element (myc(H-P)21). In a band shift assay with HL60 cells nuclear extract, probes of either the plus strand or the minus strand gave rise to specific signals. Mutation introduced within a short consensus (A/TCTA/TA/TT) present in both strands completely abolished binding in either case. Southwestern blotting analysis showed that proteins of molecular weight 105, 80, 50, 45, 40, 39.5 and 14 kDa bound sequence-specifically to either strand and 22 kDa to minus strand to the cognate A/TCTA/TA/TT consensus. These single-stranded DNA binding proteins were named MSSP, c-myc gene single strand binding proteins. We attempted to isolate the cDNAs encoding these proteins by screening a human cDNA library with the plus single-stranded oligonucleotide as a probe. Among several positive clones, we have characterized one, termed MSSP-1. MSSP-1 produced in E. coli as a fusion protein with GST specifically interacted with single-stranded TCTTAT (plus myc(H-P)21) and ACT-ATT (in minus myc(H-P)21), the consensus of which can be referred to as A/TCTA/TA/TT. Sequence analysis of MSSP-1 cDNA revealed that two domains thereof are homologous to the RNA binding motifs common to several ribonucleoproteins. Interestingly, the MSSP-1/GST fusion protein specifically recognized myc(H-P)21 not only in single-stranded but also in double-stranded forms. Binding properties of MSSP-1 imply its functions in DNA replication. Furthermore, when the AT stretch in the SV40 ori core was substituted by TCTTAT, MSSP-1 promoted viral DNA replication depending on the consensus sequences.
8264599	Nucleosome-mediated disruption of transcription factor-chromatin initiation complexes at the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat in vivo.	Glucocorticoid induction of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) is short lived, returning to base levels within 24 h despite the continued presence of hormone. MMTV DNA sequences assembled as chromatin require hormone for binding by nuclear factor 1 (NF1) and octamer proteins (OCT). However, in the same cells, NF1 and OCT factors are bound to transiently introduced DNA in the absence of hormone. In contrast, recruitment of the TATA-binding protein and a novel DNA-binding protein, which we have designated FDT, for factor downstream of the TATA-binding protein, is hormone dependent for both stable and transient templates. Furthermore, transient DNA templates, but not nucleosomal templates, retain these transcription factors over the course of 24 h. This finding suggests that MMTV chromatin structure contributes to activation and cessation of transcription in vivo.
11255147	Fractionation of soybean proteins with pressurized carbon dioxide as a volatile electrolyte.	Fractionation of specific proteins from plant material is a complex and involved science, yet pure protein extracts are in high demand by a wide range of food and pharmaceutical industries. In this study carbon dioxide has been used as a volatile electrolyte to isoelectrically precipitate two major protein constituents of soybean. Carbon dioxide was shown to be effective in purifying glycinin and beta-conglycinin in a three-step process as 95% and 80% concentrated fractions with precipitation yields of 28% and 21%, respectively. Recycling of the mixed precipitate of the intermediary step enables complete separation into the concentrated fractions. Fractionation acidity was precisely controlled by a simple modification of pressure. In addition, the occurrence of a pH overshoot was prevented at any point in the fractionation vessel, as the pH minimum was defined by its equilibrium relationship with carbon dioxide operating pressure. The removal of the glycinin precipitate was an important factor in the purification procedure. The yield of the individual concentrated glycinin and beta-conglycinin precipitate fractions was a function of carbon dioxide pressure, extract concentration and, to a much lesser extent, temperature.
7935476	Isolation of a thyroid hormone-responsive gene by immunoprecipitation of thyroid hormone receptor-DNA complexes.	Thyroid hormone (T3) receptor (TR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that acts through specific binding sites in the promoter region of target genes. In order to identify new genes that are regulated by T3, we used anti-TR antiserum to immunoprecipitate TR-DNA complexes from GH4 cell nuclei that had previously been treated with a restriction enzyme. Screening of the immunopurified, cloned DNA for TR binding sites by electrophoretic mobility shift assay yielded 53 positive clones. A subset of these clones was specifically immunoprecipitated with anti-TR antiserum and may therefore represent biologically significant binding sites. One of these clones, clone 122, was characterized in detail. It includes sequences highly related to the NICER long terminal repeat-like element and contains three TR binding sites as determined by DNase I footprinting. Two of the clone 122 TR binding sites are located upstream of the TATA box, and one is located downstream. The TR binding site downstream from the promoter was necessary and sufficient to confer T3-dependent regulation in transient transfection experiments. Expression of a reporter construct under the control of the clone 122 promoter region was activated by TR in the absence of ligand and returned to basal levels after T3 addition. Clone 122 sequences hybridize to at least two different mRNAs of approximately 6 and 10 kb from GH4 cells. The levels of both of these mRNAs increased upon removal of T3. Our studies suggest that specific immunoprecipitation of chromatin allows identification of binding sites and target genes for transcription factors.
8886758	Eosinophilic lung inflammation in particulate-induced lung injury: technical consideration in isolating RNA for gene expression studies.	Particulate and other pollutant exposures are associated with lung injury and inflammation. The purpose of this study was to develop an approach by which intact RNA could be obtained from inflamed lung tissue from particulate-exposed animals in order to correlate injury with specific gene expression. Male Sprague Dawley (SD) and Fischer-344 (F-344) rats were intratracheally instilled with saline or residual oil fly ash (ROFA) particles, 8.3 mg/kg body weight in saline. At various time points following ROFA instillation, lungs were either lavaged or used for RNA isolation. ROFA exposure produced an increase in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) neutrophils in both SD and F-344 rats. A time-dependent increase in eosinophils occurred only in SD rats but not in F-344 rats. Extraction of inflamed pulmonary tissue having a high influx of eosinophils for RNA using the conventional acid guanidinium thiocyanate phenol-chloroform (AGPC) procedure failed to provide undegraded RNA suitable for RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis of beta-actin mRNA expression. Mixing intact total RNA from saline control rat lungs with degraded RNA samples from inflamed lung yielded a gel profile of degraded RNA, indicating the presence of ribonuclease-like activity in the RNA extracted from lung tissues having eosinophil influx. Evidently, the conventional AGPC procedure failed to completely remove ribonuclease activity associated with ROFA-induced pulmonary eosinophil influx. This study reports a single-step modification to the AGPC extraction method that does not require additional reagents or additional precipitation steps for extracting undegraded RNA from nuclease-rich inflamed lung tissue. The aqueous layer resulting from mixing homogenate and chloroform is extracted a second time using an equal volume of AGPC buffer followed by addition of chloroform and centrifugation. The second aqueous phase is then treated as described in the conventional RNA extraction protocol. This simple and convenient modification does not require multiple precipitations of RNA and yields undegraded RNA from inflamed lung tissue with a slightly higher A260/A280 ratio without affecting overall RNA recovery. The results indicate that undegraded RNA could not be isolated using the routine AGPC-based isolation technique from lung tissue containing eosinophils following ROFA exposure. The degraded RNA preparations were unsuitable for gene expression studies. However, undegraded RNA can be isolated from these tissues by modifying the original AGPC RNA extraction procedure, which is suitable for gene expression analysis using northern blot and RT-PCR techniques.
8961565	A method for the large scale isolation of high transformation efficiency fungal genomic DNA.	A procedure for isolation of genomic DNA from the zygomycete Cunninghamella elegans and other filamentous fungi and yeasts is reported. This procedure involves disruption of cells by grinding using dry ice, removal of polysaccharides using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and by phenol extractions, and precipitation of DNA with isopropanol at room temperature. The isolation method produced large scale (approximate 1 mg DNA/5 g wet cells) and highly purified high molecular mass DNA. Sau3AI partially digested DNA showed high transformation efficiency (> 10(6)/100 ng DNA) when ligated to ZAP-express lambda vector.
10432579	Integrated removal of nucleic acids and recovery of LDH from homogenate of beef heart by affinity precipitation.	Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was purified from beef heart homogenate by affinity precipitation. The protein purification was integrated with nucleic acid removal and was done by precipitation of nucleic acids by addition of poly(ethylene imine) PEI onto which a ligand, Cibacron blue, had been coupled. The yield of LDH after elution from the precipitate was 63%, the purification factor 6.9 and the nucleic acid content was reduced by 98%. The capacity of the affinity polymer Cibacron blue-PEI is dependent on the nucleic acid concentration in the homogenate. The beef heart homogenate had an unfavourable ratio of nucleic acids to LDH. Precipitation with recirculated Cibacron blue-PEI, already complexed with some nucleic acids, improved the yield of the enzyme to 74%. The loss of Cibacron blue-PEI, when recirculated, was less than 1% after each cycle.
10581238	Replication cycle-coordinated change of the adenine nucleotide-bound forms of DnaA protein in Escherichia coli.	The ATP-bound but not the ADP-bound form of DnaA protein is active for replication initiation at the Escherichia coli chromosomal origin. The hydrolysis of ATP bound to DnaA is accelerated by the sliding clamp of DNA polymerase III loaded on DNA. Using a culture of randomly dividing cells, we now have evidence that the cellular level of ATP-DnaA is repressed to only approximately 20% of the total DnaA molecules, in a manner depending on DNA replication. In a synchronized culture, the ATP-DnaA level showed oscillation that has a temporal increase around the time of initiation, and decreases rapidly after initiation. Production of ATP-DnaA depended on concomitant protein synthesis, but not on SOS response, Dam or SeqA. Regeneration of ATP-DnaA from ADP-DnaA was also observed. These results indicate that the nucleotide form shifts of DnaA are tightly linked with an epistatic cell cycle event and with the chromosomal replication system.
11303202	Value of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing after conization in the prediction of residual disease in the subsequent hysterectomy specimen.	OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing after conization in predicting residual disease in the subsequent hysterectomy specimen. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study was conducted on 75 patients with grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia who had cone margins or endocervical curettage specimens showing disease and who elected to undergo hysterectomy after conization. All patients underwent high-risk human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing by the Hybrid Capture II (Digene Corporation, Gaithersburg, MD) system before conization and at the time of hysterectomy (within 2-7 weeks after conization). The presence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in cells obtained by endocervical brush before hysterectomy was correlated with residual disease in the hysterectomy specimens. RESULTS: Of the 92 patients enrolled, 75 were eligible. Of these 75 patients, 52 (69.3%) had persistent human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid after conization, and 27 (36.0%) of the 75 patients had residual cervical neoplasia in the hysterectomy specimens. Those with negative results for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid after conization were all (23/23) without residual disease in the uterus (100% negative predictive value). All those who had residual disease (27/27) had positive results for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid at the time of hysterectomy (100% sensitivity). Postconization human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid status (odds ratio, 4.000; 95% confidence interval, 1.531-10.449; P =.005) and grade of dysplasia after endocervical curettage (classified as grade 2 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or less severe disease vs grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: odds ratio, 6.612; 95% confidence interval, 2.837-15.409; P =.0002) were significantly associated with residual tumor in the uterus. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study confirms an excellent sensitivity and negative predictive value of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing after conization in predicting residual cervical neoplasia. A strategy of managing patients with grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, based on postconization human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid findings and endocervical curettage results, is proposed.
12890680	An Sp1-NF-Y/progesterone receptor DNA binding-dependent mechanism regulates progesterone-induced transcriptional activation of the rabbit RUSH/SMARCA3 gene.	Steroids regulate alternative splicing of rabbit RUSH/SMARCA3, an SWI/SNF-related transcription factor. Transactivation was evaluated in 2057 bp of genomic sequence. Truncation analysis identified a minimal 252-bp region with strong basal promoter activity in transient transfection assays. The size of the 5'-untranslated region (233 bp) and the transcription start site were determined by primer extension analysis. The transcription start site mapped to a consensus initiator (Inr) element in a TATA-less region with a downstream promoter element (+29). These elements were authenticated by mutation/deletion analysis. The Inr/downstream promoter element combination is conserved in the putative core promoter (-35/+35) of the human ortholog, suggesting that transcription initiation is similarly conserved. Two Sp1 sites that are also conserved in the putative promoter of human SMARCA3 and a RUSH binding site (-616/-611) that is unique to the rabbit promoter repress basal transcription. These sites were variously authenticated by gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Analysis of the proximal promoter showed the -162/+90 region was required for progesterone responsiveness in transient transfection assays. Subsequent mutation/deletion analysis revealed a progesterone receptor half-site mediated induction by progesterone. An overlapping Y-box (in the reverse ATTGG orientation) repressed basal transcription and progesterone-induced transcriptional activation in the presence of the Sp1 sites. The specificity of progesterone receptor and transcription factor NF-Y binding were authenticated by gel shift assays. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the Y-box effects were mediated in a DNA binding-dependent fashion. This represents a unique regulatory scenario in which ligand-dependent transactivation by the progesterone receptor is subject to Sp1/NF-Y repression.
9222095	Photoreceptor rim protein: partial sequences of cDNA show a high degree of similarity to ABC transporters.	PURPOSE: To isolate and sequence cDNA for bovine rim protein, a large membrane-bound glycoprotein found in photoreceptor outer segments. METHODS: Bovine rim protein was N-terminally sequenced (22 residues) and fragments were prepared by partial proteolysis. Two internal sequences of 21 and 18 amino acid residues were obtained from 35 kDa and 32 kDa fragments, respectively. Sense and anti-sense oligonucleotide primers were constructed, based on the peptide sequences derived from the 35 kDa and 32 kDa fragments, respectively, and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify a 150 bp sequence from bovine retinal cDNA. RESULTS: The amplified sequence coded for the remainder of the peptide sequence determined from the 35 kDa fragment, which was not present in the primer, confirming that it was derived from the rim protein. The 150 bp sequence was translated to give a 50 amino acid peptide. Part of this peptide was compared with Dna sequence databases using the TFastA program, which found 94.6% identity with an EST derived from human retina and 86.1% identity to the mouse abc1 transporter. CONCLUSIONS: It is proposed that rim protein is a member of the ATP transporter family of proteins. It may be involved in transport of molecules involved in visual transduction across the photoreceptor disk membrane.
9689592	"A ""second window of protection"" occurs 24 h after ischemic preconditioning in the rat heart."	"We and others found that cardioprotection is acquired not only soon after, but also 24 h after ischemic preconditioning in canine and rabbit myocardial infarction models (second window of protection). However, a second window phenomenon against myocardial infarction was dependent on species limitations and has not been observed in porcine hearts. In this study, we examined whether the ""second window of protection"" against myocardial infarction is observed in the rat heart. In the ischemic preconditioning (IP) group, the left main coronary artery (LCA) of rats was occluded four times for 3 min. each separated by reperfusion for 10 min. After 0, 3, and 24 h, the rats were subjected to a 20-min LCA occlusion followed by 48-h reperfusion. At 0 and 24 h after IP, infarct size and the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) during ischemia were significantly reduced compared with corresponding sham-operated groups without preconditioning. After 3 h of IP, there were no differences either in the incidence of VF during ischemia or in infarct size. Manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) content in ischemic (LCA) region of myocardium significantly increased as compared with that of sham-operated rats 24 h after IP. Treatment with N-2-mercaptopropionyl glycine, an antioxidant and a hydroxyl radical scavenger, during IP abolished the early-phase (0 h after IP) and late-phase (24 h after IP) cardioprotection and the corresponding late increase in Mn-SOD content. These results indicate that a ""second window of protection"" against myocardial infarction also exists in rat hearts and the induction of an intrinsic scavenger, Mn-SOD, via free radical production during IP may be important in the second window of protection."
10581235	The structure of a chromosomal high mobility group protein-DNA complex reveals sequence-neutral mechanisms important for non-sequence-specific DNA recognition.	The high mobility group (HMG) chromosomal proteins, which are common to all eukaryotes, bind DNA in a non-sequence-specific fashion to promote chromatin function and gene regulation. They interact directly with nucleosomes and are believed to be modulators of chromatin structure. They are also important in V(D)J recombination and in activating a number of regulators of gene expression, including p53, Hox transcription factors and steroid hormone receptors, by increasing their affinity for DNA. The X-ray crystal structure, at 2.2 A resolution, of the HMG domain of the Drosophila melanogaster protein, HMG-D, bound to DNA provides the first detailed view of a chromosomal HMG domain interacting with linear DNA and reveals the molecular basis of non-sequence-specific DNA recognition. Ser10 forms water-mediated hydrogen bonds to DNA bases, and Val32 with Thr33 partially intercalates the DNA. These two 'sequence-neutral' mechanisms of DNA binding substitute for base-specific hydrogen bonds made by equivalent residues of the sequence-specific HMG domain protein, lymphoid enhancer factor-1. The use of multiple intercalations and water-mediated DNA contacts may prove to be generally important mechanisms by which chromosomal proteins bind to DNA in the minor groove.
11909857	Metastable macromolecular complexes containing high mobility group nucleosome-binding chromosomal proteins in HeLa nuclei.	High mobility group nucleosome-binding (HMGN) proteins belong to a family of nuclear proteins that bind to nucleosomes and enhance transcription from chromatin templates by altering the structure of the chromatin fiber. The intranuclear organization of these proteins is dynamic and related to the metabolic state of the cell. Here we report that approximately 50% of the HMGN proteins are organized into macromolecular complexes in a fashion that is similar to that of other nuclear activities that modify the structure of the chromatin fiber. We identify several distinct HMGN-containing complexes that are relatively unstable and find that the inclusion of HMGN in the complexes varies according to the metabolic state of the cell. The nucleosome binding ability of HMGN in the complex is stronger than that of the free HMGN. We suggest that the inclusion of HMGN proteins into metastable multiprotein complexes serves to target the HMGN proteins to specific sites in chromatin and enhances their interaction with nucleosomes.
12228709	Molecular biology. Chromatin higher order folding--wrapping up transcription.	Eukaryotic genomes are organized into condensed, heterogeneous chromatin fibers throughout much of the cell cycle. Here we describe recent studies indicating that even transcriptionally active loci may be encompassed within 80- to 100-nanometer-thick chromonema fibers. These studies suggest that chromatin higher order folding may be a key feature of eukaryotic transcriptional control. We also discuss evidence suggesting that adenosine-5'-triphosphate-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzymes and histone-modifying enzymes may regulate transcription by controlling the extent and dynamics of chromatin higher order folding.
9271422	Identification of a member of a DNA-dependent ATPase family that causes interference with silencing.	DNA in eukaryotic cells is packed in tandem repeats of nucleosomes or higher-order chromatin structures, which present obstacles to many cellular processes that require protein-DNA interactions, such as transcription, DNA repair, and recombination. To find proteins that are involved in increasing the accessibility of specific DNA regions in yeast, we used a genetic approach that exploited transcriptional silencing normally occurring at HML and HMR loci. The silencing is mediated by cis-acting silencer elements and is thought to require the formation of a special chromatin structure that prevents accessibility to the silenced DNA. A previously uncharacterized gene, termed DIS1, was isolated from a screen for genes that interfere with silencing when overexpressed. DIS1 encodes a protein with conserved motifs that are present in a family of DNA-dependent ATPases, the SWI2/SNF2-like proteins. Overproduction of N-terminal half of DIS1 protein interfered specifically with ectopic silencing used in the screen as well as HMR E silencing. Two-hybrid studies revealed a specific interaction between the N terminus of DIS1 and the C-terminal half of SIR4, a protein essential for silencing. Cells with a dis1 knockout mutation had significantly lower mating-type switching rate. These results suggest that DIS1 may contribute to making the silenced DNA template at HM loci more accessible during the mating-type switching process.
11388809	Overexpression, rapid isolation, and biochemical characterization of Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein.	Escherichia coli (E. coli) single-stranded binding protein (SSB) is a valuable protein for various biotechnical applications, such as PCR and DNA sequencing. Here we describe an efficient expression and purification scheme where the tendency of SSB to aggregate at low salt concentration and high protein concentration is avoided. The method contains fewer steps of purification and results in high protein yield, compared to previous published protocols. In our protocol, cells are harvested after cultivation overnight and SSB is isolated by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by anion-exchange chromatography. The yield from a 2-liter fed-batch fermentor is 2 g protein, which is higher than all production methods for SSB earlier reported. Moreover, the two classical isolation steps combined in the purification scheme are robust, cost-efficient, and suitable for scaling up. The resulting SSB is pure and a correctly folded tetramer with an apparent binding to single-stranded DNA with a K(D) of 10(-8) M, as determined by surface plasmon resonance.
12509425	Interaction of NF-E2 in the human beta-globin locus control region before chromatin remodeling.	When transcription is initiated under repressive conditions, such as when chromatin are packed together, binding followed by the functioning of key components in the transcriptional apparatus should be appropriately facilitated in the chromatin architecture. We provide evidence that the erythroid-specific enhancer- binding protein NF-E2 interacts with the cognate motif at DNase I-hypersensitive site 2 of the human beta-globin locus control region in a repressive state. The nucleosome containing the NF-E2-binding site showed characteristic rotational and translational phases in vitro. The binding site had less affinity to the histone octamers than nearby regions while showing greater accessibility to DNase I and micrococcal nuclease. Furthermore, the motif was recognized by the exogenous NF-E2 protein expressed in HeLa cells, which have a repressive state of chromatin at the beta-globin locus, as shown by ligation-mediated PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. These lines of evidence indicate that NF-E2 interacts with the cognate motif on the nucleosome before chromatin is remodeled.
7549193	Preconditioning and its potential role in myocardial protection during cardiac surgery.	Myocardial preconditioning is the phenomenon whereby a brief stress to the heart (e.g., ischemia, hypoxia, etc.) prior to a prolonged period of ischemia renders the heart more resistant to ischemic injury. The cardioprotective effects of preconditioning include reduced infarct size and reduced ventricular arrhythmias. Preconditioning also is associated with beneficial metabolic effects during the prolonged ischemia, effects that also are observed during intermittent cardioplegia. However, there are conflicting reports about the effects of preconditioning on postischemic ventricular function. Although adenosine is thought to be the endogenous mediator of ischemic preconditioning, there are some important differences between adenosine and ischemic preconditioning mediated cardioprotection.
8921387	Characterization of EZH1, a human homolog of Drosophila Enhancer of zeste near BRCA1.	Recent transcription mapping efforts within chromosome 17q21 have led to the identification of a human homolog of the Drosophila gene Enhancer of zeste, E(z). A member of the Polycomb group (Pc-G) of proteins, Drosophila E(z) acts as a negative regulator of the segment identity genes of the Antennapedia and Bithorax complexes. Here we report the full-length protein coding sequence of human EZH1 (Enhancer of zeste homolog 1) and compare the respective protein sequences in both species. EZH1 encodes a protein of 747 amino acids that displays 55% amino acid identity overall (70% similarity) with Drosophila E(z). The strongest homology was noted (79% identity, 89% similarity) within the carboxy-terminal 245 amino acids, including the SET domain, a region of E(z) also conserved in other Drosophila proteins with roles in development and/or chromatin structure. A large Cysrich region with a novel spatial pattern of cysteine residues was also conserved in both EZH1 and E(z). The strong sequence conservation suggest potential roles for EZH1 in human development as a transcriptional regulator and as a component of protein complexes that stably maintain heterochromatin. EZH1 is expressed as two major transcripts in all adult and fetal human tissues surveyed; comparison of cloned cDNAs suggests that alternative splicing may account for at least part of the transcript size difference. Analysis of one cDNA revealed an unusual splicing event involving EZH1 and a tandemly linked gene GPR2 and suggests a potential mechanism for modifying the EZH1 protein in the conserved C-terminal domain. The sequence and isolated cDNAs will provide useful reagents for determining the function of EZH1 and the importance of the evolutionarily conserved domains.
11934077	Isolation and biochemical characterization of extracellular polymeric secretions (EPS) from modern soft marine stromatolites (Bahamas) and its inhibitory effect on CaCO3 precipitation.	Bahamian soft marine stromatolites consist of cyanobacterial biofilms and carbonate sand grains (ooids) embedded in their extracellular polymeric secretions (EPS). EPS were isolated from natural marine stromatolites and the laboratory cultured stromatolite forming cyanobacterium isolate Schizothix sp. Laboratory investigations were conducted to examine biochemical characteristics and the role of EPS in the inhibition of CaCO3 precipitation. EPS consisted of acid polysaccharides and proteins. SDS-PAGE and amino acid analysis suggested that EPS from both soft marine stromatolite and Schizothrix sp. mat contained small proteins (38 kD and 45 kD) enriched in aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Also, immuno blotting suggested that natural EPS contain high molecular weight acid polysaccharide (500 k) which may represent cross-linked products of laboratory cultured Schizothrix sp. acid polysaccharide (300 k). EPS from both soft marine stromatolite and laboratory cultured Schizothrix sp. inhibited CaCO3 precipitation in vitro, as determined using pH drift assays examining pH decrease which occur in response to CaCO3 precipitation. PH drift assays of enzymatically and chemically modified EPS isolated from soft marine stromatolite and laboratory cultured Schizothrix sp. indicated that both uronic acids and protein fractions may be involved in the inhibition of CaCO3 precipitation.
7827100	A sheep hydatid cyst glycoprotein as receptors for three toxic lectins, as well as Abrus precatorius and Ricinus communis agglutinins.	The binding properties of a glycoprotein with blood group P1 specificity isolated from sheep hydatid cyst fluid with Gal and GalNAc specific lectins was investigated by quantitative precipitin and precipitin inhibition assays. The glycoprotein completely precipitated Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA1), Abrus precatorius agglutinin (APA) and Mistletoe toxic lectin-I (ML-I). Only 1.0 microgram of P1 glycoprotein was required to precipitate 50% of 5.1 micrograms ML-I nitrogen. It also reacted well with abrin-a and ricin, precipitating over 73% of the lectin nitrogen added, but poorly or weakly with Dolichos biflorus (DBL), Vicia villosa (VVL, a mixture of A4, A2B2 and B4), VVL-B4, Arachis hypogaea (PNA), Maclura pomifera (MPL), Bauchinia purpurea alba (BPL) and Wistaria floribunda (WFL) lectins. When an inhibition assay in the range of 5.1 micrograms N to 5.9 micrograms N of lectins (ML-I, abrin-a; ricin, RCA1, and APA, and 10 micrograms P1 active glycoprotein interaction was performed; from 76 to 100% of the precipitations were inhibited by 0.44 and 0.52 mumol of Gal alpha 1-->4Gal and Gal beta 1-->4GlcNAc, respectively, but not or insignificantly with 1.72 mumol of GlcNAc. The Gal alpha 1-->4Gal disaccharide found in this P1 active glycoprotein is a frequently occurring sequence of many glycosphingolipids located at the surface of mammalian cell membranes, especially human erythrocytes and intestinal cells for ligand binding and microbial toxin attachment. The present finding suggests that the Gal alpha 1-->4Gal beta 1-->4GlcNAc sequence in this P1 active glycoprotein is one of the best glycoprotein receptors for three toxic lectins (ricin, abrin-a, and ML-I) as well as for APA, and RCA1, and the result of inhibition assay implies that these lectins are recognizing part or all of the Gal alpha 1-->4Gal beta 1-->4GlcNAc sequence in the P1 active glycoprotein.
11879731	Chromatin structure and dynamics: functional implications.	In eucaryotes, DNA packaging into nucleosomes and its organization in a chromatin fiber generate constraints for all processes involving DNA, such as DNA-replication, -repair, -recombination, and -transcription. Transient changes in chromatin structure allow overcoming these constraints with different requirements in regions where processes described above are initiated. Mechanisms involved in chromatin dynamics are complex. Multiprotein complexes which can contain histone-acetyltransferase, -deacetylase, -methyltransferase or -kinase activities are targeted by regulatory factors to precise regions of the genome. These enzymes have been shown to modify histone-tails within specific nucleosomes. Post-translational modifications of histone-tails constitute a code that is thought to contribute to the nucleosome or to the chromatin fiber remodeling, either directly, or through the recruitment of other proteins. Other multiprotein complexes, such as ATP-dependent remodeling complexes, play an essential role in chromatin fiber dynamics allowing nucleosome sliding and redistribution on the DNA. We will focus here on the chromatin structure and its consequences for DNA damaging, replication, repair, and transcription and we will discuss the mechanisms of chromatin remodeling.
7554047	Interaction of bulky chemical carcinogens with DNA in chromatin.	DNA damage is an important effect of treatment of cells and organisms with chemical carcinogens. Although much has been learned from in vitro studies of the reaction of carcinogens with purified DNA, in vivo the DNA is associated with a variety of histone and non-histone proteins in a complex and dynamic structure known as chromatin. The covalent interactions of bulky chemical carcinogens with chromatin are reviewed. Differences from bulk genomic DNA in adduct density are found in replicating, transcribing and nuclear matrix-bound DNA regions, and between DNA in nucleosome cores and linker DNA regions. These differences range from 2- to 3-fold for linker versus core, to approximately 8-fold close to a replication fork. Much remains to be done to determine the influences of non-histone proteins and higher order chromatin structure on carcinogen binding.
8083303	Nucleosome positioning and gene regulation.	"Recent genetic and biochemical studies have revealed critical information concerning the role of nucleosomes in eukaryotic gene regulation. Nucleosomes package DNA into a dynamic chromatin structure, and by assuming defined positions in chromatin, influence gene regulation. Nucleosomes can serve as repressors, presumably by blocking access to regulatory elements; consequently, the positions of nucleosomes relative to the location of cis-acting elements are critical. Some genes have a chromatin structure that is ""preset,"" ready for activation, while others require ""remodeling"" for activation. Nucleosome positioning may be determined by multiple factors, including histone-DNA interactions, boundaries defined by DNA structure or protein binding, and higher-order chromatin structure."
9169189	In vitro reconstitution and analysis of mononucleosomes containing defined DNAs and proteins.	Increasingly, biochemical analyses of processes that occur within eukaryotic nuclei such as transcription and replication require the construction of specific chromatin substrates. Nucleosome complexes reconstituted in vitro have been key elements in a variety of recent studies of polymerase progression and trans-acting factor binding activities. Reconstituted complexes can be easily constructed from purified components in quantities suitable for biochemical and biophysical studies. In addition, reconstituted mononucleosome complexes exhibit native biochemical and biophysical properties but necessarily contain much less heterogeneity with regard to both protein and DNA components than bulk complexes isolated from natural sources. This review details the protocols for reconstitution of model mononucleosome complexes that contain unique DNA sequences and specifically tailored core histone proteins and describes common pitfalls associated with these procedures.
10805181	How amino acids control the binding of Cu(II) ions to DNA. Part III. A novel interaction of a histidine complex with DNA.	L-Histidine Cu(II) complex bound to DNA showed broad EPR signals characteristic of the aggregated Cu(II) species, which could be observed even when the molar ratio of L-histidine to Cu(II) ion was smaller than unity. The signal for the DNA fibers changed with the orientation of the fibers in the static magnetic field. Based on these results, the signal was assigned to a mono-histidine Cu(II) complex stereospecifically aggregated in a groove or along a phosphodiester chain of the double helical DNA. In contrast to the L-histidine complex, the D-histidine complex bound to DNA did not show such broad signals and the observed spectra for the complex on B-form DNA fibers at -150 degrees C were simulated assuming that the g1 axis of the mono-D-histidine complex tilts by about 55 degrees from the DNA-fiber axis. Addition of some deoxy-nucleotides, but not deoxy-nucleosides, to a solution of a mono-histidine complex resulted in the formation of a dinuclear ternary complex with different structures for L- or D-histidine, suggesting the possibility that the stereospecific aggregation of the L-histidine complex on a double helical DNA was mediated by the phosphodiester backbones.
11792803	The S. pombe aurora-related kinase Ark1 associates with mitotic structures in a stage dependent manner and is required for chromosome segregation.	Metazoans contain three aurora-related kinases. Aurora A is required for spindle formation while aurora B is required for chromosome condensation and cytokinesis. Less is known about the function of aurora C. S. pombe contains a single aurora-related kinase, Ark1. Although Ark1 protein levels remained constant as cells progressed through the mitotic cell cycle, its distribution altered during mitosis and meiosis. Throughout G2 Ark1 was concentrated in one to three nuclear foci that were not associated with the spindle pole body/centromere complex. Following commitment to mitosis Ark1 associated with chromatin and was particularly concentrated at several sites including kinetochores/centromeres. Kinetochore/centromere association diminished during anaphase A, after which it was distributed along the spindle. The protein became restricted to a small central zone that transiently enlarged as the spindle extended. As in many other systems mitotic fission yeast cells exhibit a much greater degree of phosphorylation of serine 10 of histone H3 than interphase cells. A number of studies have linked this modification with chromosome condensation. Ark1 immuno-precipitates phosphorylated serine 10 of histone H3 in vitro. This activity was highest in mitotic extracts. The absence of the histone H3 phospho-serine 10 epitope from mitotic cells in which the ark1(+) gene had been deleted (ark1.Delta1); the inability of these cells to resolve their chromosomes during anaphase and the co-localisation of this phospho-epitope with Ark1 early in mitosis, all suggest that Ark1 phosphorylates serine 10 of histone H3 in vivo. ark1.Delta1 cells also exhibited a reduction in kinetochore activity and a minor defect in spindle formation. Thus the enzyme activity, localisation and phenotype arising from our manipulations of this single fission yeast aurora kinase family member suggest that this single kinase is executing functions that are separately implemented by distinct aurora A and aurora B kinases in higher systems.
12234831	No ischemic preconditioning in heterozygous connexin43-deficient mice.	Protein kinase Cepsilon (PKCepsilon) plays a central role in ischemic preconditioning (IP) in mice and rabbits, and activated PKCepsilon colocalizes with and phosphorylates connexin43 (Cx43) in rats and humans. Whether or not Cx43 contributes to the mechanism(s) of IP in vivo is yet unknown. Therefore, wild-type (n = 8) and heterozygous Cx43-deficient mice (n = 8) were subjected to 30 min occlusion and 120 min reperfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. IP was induced by one cycle of 5 min occlusion and 10 min reperfusion (n = 8/8 mice) before the sustained occlusion. Infarct size was reduced by IP in wild-type mice [11.3 +/- 3.4% vs. 23.7 +/- 7.2% of the left ventricle (LV), P < 0.05] but not in Cx43-deficient mice (26.0 +/- 6.0% vs. 25.1 +/- 3.8% of LV). Also, three cycles of 5 min occlusion and 10 min reperfusion (n = 5) did not induce protection in Cx43-deficient mice (27.6 +/- 5.5 % of LV). Thus Cx43 contributes to the protection of IP in mice in vivo.
12244572	14-3-3sigma is a cruciform DNA binding protein and associates in vivo with origins of DNA replication.	A human cruciform binding protein (CBP) was previously shown to bind to cruciform DNA in a structure-specific manner and be a member of the 14-3-3 protein family. CBP had been found to contain the 14-3-3 isoforms beta, gamma, epsilon, and zeta. Here, we show by Western blot analysis that the CBP-cruciform DNA complex eluted from band-shift polyacrylamide gels also contains the 14-3-3sigma isoform, which is present in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. An antibody specific for the 14-3-3sigma isoform was able to interfere with the formation of the CBP-cruciform DNA complex. The effect of the same anti-14-3-3sigma antibody in the in vitro replication of p186, a plasmid containing the minimal replication origin of the monkey origin ors8, was also analyzed. Pre-incubation of total HeLa cell extracts with this antibody decreased p186 in vitro replication to approximately 30% of control levels, while non-specific antibodies had no effect. 14-3-3sigma was found to associate in vivo with the monkey origins of DNA replication ors8 and ors12 in a cell cycle-dependent manner, as assayed by a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay that involved formaldehyde cross-linking, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-14-3-3sigma antibody and quantitative PCR. The association of 14-3-3sigma with the replication origins was maximal at the G(1)/S phase. The results indicate that 14-3-3sigma is an origin binding protein involved in the regulation of DNA replication via cruciform DNA binding.
7568143	The 37/40-kilodalton autoantigen in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is the putative tyrosine phosphatase IA-2.	"Major targets for autoantibodies associated with the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) include tryptic fragments with a molecular mass of 37 kDa and/or 40 kDa of a pancreatic islet cell antigen of unknown identity. The assay identifying autoantibodies against the 37/40-kDa antigen in human sera is based on the immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled rat insulinoma cell proteins with sera from IDDM patients, followed by limited trypsin digestion of the immunoprecipitated material. To identify cDNA clones coding for the 37/40-kDa antigen, we have screened a cDNA expression library from rat insulinoma cells with a serum from an IDDM patient that precipitated the 37/40-kDa antigen in our assay. Among the cDNA products that reacted with the IDDM serum, we identified one cDNA clone whose open reading frame encodes a protein with a predicted mass of 105 kDa that we termed ""ICA105"" for 105-kDa islet cell antibody. The deduced amino acid sequence has high homology to a recently cloned putative tyrosine phosphatase IA-2 from human and mouse cDNA libraries. Translation of the cDNA in vitro results in a polypeptide with the expected molecular mass of 105 kDa. The evidence that ICA105 is indeed the precursor of the 37/40-kDa tryptic fragments is based on the following three results: (i) Sera from IDDM patients containing autoantibodies to the 37/40-kDa antigen precipitate the in vitro translated polypeptide, whereas sera from healthy subjects as well as sera from IDDM patients not reactive with the 37/40-kDa antigen do not precipitate the cDNA product. (ii) Immunoprecipitation of the in vitro translated protein with sera containing autoantibodies to the 37/40-kDa antigen followed by limited trypsin digestion of the precipitated proteins results in a 40-kDa polypeptide. (iii) The protein derived from our cDNA but not from an unrelated control cDNA clone can block immunoprecipitation of the 37/40-kDa antigen from a labeled rat insulinoma cell extract. The availability of the cloned 37/40-kDa antigen should facilitate the identification of individuals at risk of IDDM with increased accuracy. Furthermore, the identification of the 37/40-kDa antigen as the putative tyrosine phosphatase IA-2 is of relevance in elucidating the role of this antigen in the development of IDDM."
8993038	Ligation-mediated PCR for chromatin-structure analysis of interphase and metaphase chromatin.	Chromatin structure is becoming increasingly recognized as important for a full understanding of gene function and cell memory. With regard to cell memory, which involves the transfer of chromatin-encoded epigenetic information from one cell generation to another, the detailed structure of metaphase chromatin is of crucial importance. In this paper we describe methods for the use of dimethyl sulfate, DNase I, and potassium permanganate for in vivo footprinting and chromatin analysis, with special emphasis on studies of metaphase cells. We review the use of ligation-mediated PCR for the analysis of chromatin, including the human phosphoglycerate kinase promoter, and also report initial studies of a matrix attachment region near the human beta-interferon gene.
9279381	Participation of deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase alpha in amplification of ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid in Xenopus laevis.	Aphidicolin, a known inhibitor of eucaryotic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase alpha, efficiently inhibited amplification of ribosomal DNA during oogenesis in Xenopus laevis. DNA polymerase alpha, but not DNA polymerase gamma, as isolated from ovaries, was sensitive to aphidicolin. DNA polymerase beta was not detectable in Xenopus ovary extracts. Therefore, DNA polymerase alpha plays a major role in ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene amplification.
9396821	Retinoblastoma protein expression facilitates chromatin remodeling at the HLA-DRA promoter.	The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes encode a series of heterodimeric cell surface glycoproteins that bind peptide antigen. The MHC class II/peptide complex is bound by the T-cell receptor of CD4(+) T cells, thereby stimulating an immune response. The MHC class II genes are coordinately regulated by conserved promoter elements and are inducible by IFN-gamma. Furthermore, IFN-gamma induction of the MHC class II genes in solid human tumor lines requires retinoblastoma protein (Rb). In vivo footprinting analyses of the HLA-DRA gene, which encodes the heavy chain subunit of the human MHC class II molecule, HLA-DR, revealed that Rb facilitates occupancy of multiple HLA-DRA promoter elements. Detecting the effect of Rb on HLA-DRA promoter occupancy in vivo required IFN-gamma treatment. However, use of a variation on the in vivo footprinting technique, nuclei footprinting, which assays for promoter occupancy in isolated nuclei, revealed that expression of Rb facilitates promoter occupancy even in the absence of IFN-gamma. These results indicate that expression of Rb leads to modification of the chromatin environment of the HLA-DRA promoter independently of transcription.
9492263	Chromatin and transcription--how transcription factors battle with a repressive chromatin environment.	The last year has seen much progress in our understanding of chromatin and transcription. Transcriptionally active chromatin has long been correlated with a higher level of histone acetlyation. The discovery of a nuclear histone acetyltransferase activity encoded by factors with a role in transcription raises the possibility that the cell is able to dynamically modulate the (local) level of histone acteylation, switching chromatin templates from inactive to transcriptionally active states. Furthermore, histone acetylation states have shown to play a role in determining the efficacy of transcriptionally silenced chromatin in both yeast and Drosophila. The advances in our knowledge regarding the role of the origin-recognition complex in the establishment of silencing, and the requirement for a locally concentrated zone of the silence information regulator proteins in the nucleus has provided insights into the complex architecture of silenced chromatin. The goal of understanding the mechanisms by which the cell is able to 'open' repressive chromatin structures has prompted the discovery of multiple chromatin remodelling activities. These large protein complexes identified from organisms as diverse as yeast, mouse, fly and man demonstrate the ubiquity and fundamental importance of the ability to perturb the structure of chromatin allowing transcription of the desired genes. These data provide the latest and potentially most significant demonstration of the importance of the nucleosome in the regulation of transcription.
10408173	Detection of chromatin-bound PCNA in mammalian cells and its use to study DNA excision repair.	Compelling evidence indicates that proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is an indispensable factor not only in DNA replication but in nucleotide excision repair (NER), alternative pathway of base excision repair (BER), and mismatch repair. The common function of PCNA in each of these is to assist in the initiation of DNA synthesis by providing a scaffolding clamp as a trimer catalyzed by RF-C at the 3'-OH terminus of a nascent DNA strand, to which DNA polymerase delta or epsilon can bind. Interestingly, DNA synthesis is reported to be ingeniously inhibited in replication, but not in NER owing to the interaction with CDKN1A (formerly known as p21/WAF1/CIP1). Furthermore, several proteins, XPG, FEN1, and DNA ligase I, recently were shown to competitively bind to the same region of PCNA, the interdomain connector loop, to which DNA polymerase delta or epsilon also binds. PCNA therefore seems to have a regulatory role in these DNA transactions. The in vitro reconstituted experimental system has been a powerful tool to obtain these lines of evidence, but another approach, immunofluorescence studies, also has been a contributor. In fact, the involvement of PCNA in DNA replication, NER, and BER has for the first time been indicated by a unique method that makes visible only in vivo chromatin-bound PCNA. The usefulness of this method and the importance of cooperative studies done with in vitro and in vivo experimental systems is discussed in terms of DNA excision repair.
10997781	The distribution of somatic H1 subtypes is non-random on active vs. inactive chromatin: distribution in human fetal fibroblasts.	Chromatin immunoprecipitation was employed to determine whether or not the previously reported depletion of histone H1 on actively transcribed sequences was selective with respect to H1 subtypes. DNA of immunofractionated chromatin was analyzed by slot-blots for repetitive sequences and PCR for single and low-copy sequences. Based on the analysis of a diverse set of sequences, we report distinct differences in subtype distributions. Actively transcribed chromatin, as well as chromatin poised for transcription, is characterized by a relative depletion of somatic H1 subtypes 2 and 4 (H1s-2 and H1s-4),whereas facultative and constitutive heterochromatin contain all four somatic subtypes. These results support a model in which subtypes are selectively depleted upon gene expression. In turn, the data also support the possibility that the somatic subtypes have different functional roles based on their selective depletion from different classes of DNA sequences.
11420718	In vivo analysis of the model tyrosine aminotransferase gene reveals multiple sequential steps in glucocorticoid receptor action.	We are studying the mechanisms of transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors and we focus our studies on the glucocorticoid regulation of the model tyrosine aminotransferase gene. Rather than using in vitro biochemical approaches, we determine the actual events occurring in the cells. Our experimental approaches include genomic footprinting, chromatin immunoprecipitation, in situ hybridization and transgenic mice. Our results show that the glucocorticoid receptor uses a dynamic multistep mechanism to recruit successively accessory DNA binding proteins that assist in the activation process. Chromatin is first remodelled, DNA is then demethylated, and the synthesis of an accessory factor is induced. Efficient transcription induction is finally achieved upon the formation of a 'stable' multiprotein complex interacting with the regulatory element. We discuss: the relative contribution of histone acetyltransferases and ATP-dependent remodelling machines to the chromatin remodelling event; the nature of the remodelled state; the contribution of regulated DNA demethylation to gene memory during development; the mechanisms of regulated DNA demethylation; the dynamics of protein recruitment at regulatory elements; the control of the frequency of transcription pulses and the control levels of the cell-type specificity of the glucocorticoid response.
7989436	Rapid small-scale isolation of herpes simplex virus DNA.	A method has been developed for the rapid isolation of herpes simplex virus DNA analogous to miniprep methods for bacterial plasmid isolation. Infected Vero cells are lysed with three freeze-thaw cycles, and the nuclei are removed by centrifugation. DNA is released from the virions in the supernatant by proteinase K digestion. Then the DNA is extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. This method requires only small amounts of infected cells as a source of viral DNA, does not use radioactivity, and routinely produces DNA of sufficient purity to be used for restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis on ethidium-stained gels.
8770495	Detection of apoptotic cells by selective precipitation of [3H]thymidine-labelled DNA.	Apoptosis is characterized by systematic fragmentation of high-molecular-weight DNA into oligonucleosome fragments. A sensitive method for detection of apoptotic cells involving [3H]thymidine-labelled DNA is presented. Cells from mid-log-phase cultures were labelled with [3H]thymidine for 15 to 18 h and then exposed to gamma irradiation to induce apoptosis. A modified Hirt method was used to separate low-molecular-weight DNA from high-molecular-weight DNA. The percentage of fragmented DNA and high-molecular-weight DNA were measured by scintillation spectrometry. This method was compared with an established flow cytometric method for detection of apoptotic cells by using propidium iodide staining of DNA. We observed a good correlation between these two methods in detecting apoptosis. Hence, expensive flow cytometric assays for detection of apoptosis in dividing cells may be replaceable by a method involving [3H]thymidine labelling of DNA and separation of low-molecular-weight DNA from high-molecular-weight DNA by precipitation.
11405491	Cytokine responses in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery after ischemic preconditioning.	OBJECTIVE: The release of proinflammatory cytokines has been shown to be associated with the development of complications after coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass. The purpose of the present study was to establish whether ischemic preconditioning (IP) could limit inflammatory cytokines release in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with multiple-vessel coronary artery disease and stable angina admitted for first-time elective coronary artery bypass surgery were randomized into control or ischemic preconditioning groups. Patients in the IP group were exposed to two cycles of two-minute myocardial ischemia, followed by three minutes of reperfusion, at the beginning of the revascularization operation, before the cross-clamping and ischemic period used for coronary artery bypass graft anastomosis. Peripheral plasma levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 were measured perioperatively. RESULTS: Significant elevation of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 were observed in both groups after reperfusion. Ischemic preconditioning has no effect on cytokine release in the early stage after reperfusion. Arterial blood IL-6 levels in the preconditioning group were significantly lower than in controls at 20 h after declamping (52.93 +/- 9.79 vs 96.04 +/- 17.56 pg/ml, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that ischemic preconditioning results in no effect on systemic inflammatory cytokine release in the early stage but a delayed reduction in IL-6 levels at 20 h after reperfusion.
8107104	The footprint of chromosomal proteins HMG-14 and HMG-17 on chromatin subunits.	The position of chromosomal proteins HMG-14 and HMG-17 in nucleosome cores and in chromatosomes lacking linker histones has been mapped by hydroxyl radical footprinting. Both the nucleosome core and the H1/H5 depleted chromatosome can specifically bind two molecules of HMG-14/-17. The path of HMG-14 on the surface of chromatin subunits is indistinguishable from that of HMG-17. The bound HMGs protect the DNA from hydroxyl radical cleavage 25 base-pairs from the end of the DNA in nucleosome cores and in each of the two major grooves of the DNA flanking the nucleosomal dyad axis. Thus, in both cores and H1/H5-depleted chromatosomes the proteins bridge two adjacent DNA strands on the surface of the particles. The sites occupied by HMG near the end of the chromatosome-length particles are distinct from those occupied by the H1/H5 linker histones. In the region of the dyad axis the binding sites of HMGs overlap those of the linker histones. The placement of HMG-14/-17 near the nucleosomal dyad axis raises the possibility that interactions between histone H1 and HMGs may affect the transcriptional potential of chromatin.
8114727	Characterization of a novel 23-kilodalton protein of unactive progesterone receptor complexes.	Immunoprecipitation of unactivated avian progesterone receptor results in the copurification of hsp90, hsp70, and three additional proteins, p54, p50, and p23. p23 is also present in immunoaffinity-purified hsp90 complexes along with hsp70 and another protein, p60. Antibody and cDNA probes for p23 were prepared in an effort to elucidate the significance and function of this protein. Antibodies to p23 detect similar levels of p23 in all tissues tested and cross-react with a protein of the same size in mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, humans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that p23 is a conserved protein of broad tissue distribution. These antibodies were used to screen a chicken brain cDNA library, resulting in the isolation of a 468-bp partial cDNA clone encoding a sequence containing four sequences corresponding to peptide fragments isolated from chicken p23. This partial clone was subsequently used to isolate a full-length human cDNA clone. The human cDNA encodes a protein of 160 amino acids that does not show homology to previously identified proteins. The chicken and human cDNAs are 88% identical at the DNA level and 96.3% identical at the protein level. p23 is a highly acidic phosphoprotein with an aspartic acid-rich carboxy-terminal domain. Bacterially overexpressed human p23 was used to raise several monoclonal antibodies to p23. These antibodies specifically immunoprecipitate p23 in complex with hsp90 in all tissues tested and can be used to immunoaffinity isolate progesterone receptor complexes from chicken oviduct cytosol.
10679327	Lif1p targets the DNA ligase Lig4p to sites of DNA double-strand breaks.	DNA ligases catalyse the joining of DNA single- and double-strand breaks. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc9p is a homologue of mammalian DNA ligase I and is required for DNA replication, recombination and single-strand break repair. The other yeast ligase, Lig4p/Dnl4p, is a homologue of mammalian DNA ligase IV, and functions in the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA double-strand break repair [1] [2] [3] [4]. Lig4p interacts with Lif1p, the yeast homologue of the human ligase IV-associated protein, XRCC4 [5]. This interaction takes place through the carboxy-terminal domain of Lig4p and is required for Lig4p stability. We show that the carboxy-terminal interaction region of Lig4p is necessary for NHEJ but, when fused to Cdc9p, is insufficient to confer NHEJ function to Cdc9p. Also, Lif1p stimulates the in vitro catalytic activity of Lig4p in adenylation and DNA ligation. Nevertheless, Lig4p is inactive in NHEJ in the absence of Lif1p in vivo, even when Lig4p is stably expressed. We show that Lif1p binds DNA in vitro and, through in vivo cross-linking and chromatin immuno precipitation assays, demonstrate that it targets Lig4p to chromosomal DNA double-strand breaks. Furthermore, this targeting requires another key NHEJ protein, Ku.
10884300	Measurement of apolipoprotein B concentration in plasma lipoproteins by combining selective precipitation and mass spectrometry.	The measurement of apolipoprotein B (apoB) in purified lipoproteins by immunological assays is subject to criticism because of denatured epitopes or immunoreactivity differences between purified lipoproteins and standard. Chemical methods have therefore been developed, such as the selective precipitation of apoB followed by quantification of the precipitate. In this study, we present the measurement of apoB concentration in lipoproteins purified by ultracentrifugation by combining isopropanol precipitation and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL; d < 1.006 g/mL); VLDL plus intermediate density lipoprotein (VLDL + IDL; d < 1.019 g/mL); and VLDL, IDL, and low density lipoprotein (VLDL + IDL + LDL; d < 1.063 g/mL) were purified by ultracentrifugation. Apolipoprotein B-100 was selectively precipitated by isopropanol. The leucine content of the pellet was then determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, using norleucine as internal standard. Knowledge of the number of leucine molecules in one apoB-100 molecule makes it possible to calculate the plasma concentration of apoB in the various lipoprotein fractions. ApoB in IDL (d 1.006-1.019 g/mL) and LDL (d 1.019-1.063 g/mL) were then determined by subtracting VLDL-apoB from apoB in lipoproteins d < 1.019 and apoB in lipoproteins d < 1.019 g/mL from apoB in lipoproteins d < 1.063 g/mL, respectively. The isopropanol precipitate was verified as pure apoB (>97%) in lipoprotein fractions isolated from normo- and hyperlipidemic plasma and the method appeared reproducible. The combination of isopropanol precipitation and the GC/MS method appears therefore to be a precise and reliable method for kinetic and epidemiological studies.
11092552	Growth regulation of human variant histone genes and acetylation of the encoded proteins.	The family of human histone genes consists of replication-dependent and independent subtypes. The replication-independent histone genes, also known as variants, give rise to distinct mRNAs, whose expression is regulated depending on the growth state of the cell, tissue type and developmental stage. In turn, the histone variants are differentially synthesized and modified by acetylation. Consequently, chromatin structure is altered resulting in complex changes in gene expression. The high conservation among histone protein subtypes suggests that they are indispensable. In addition, conservation of the positions of acetylation within subtypes suggests that the location of these sites is functionally important for the eukaryotic cell. For example, the structures of transcriptionally active and repressed chromatin are different depending on the acetylation state of histone proteins [1-3]. In addition, transcriptionally active and repressed chromatin contains distinct histone variants [4]. Specialized histone variants are targeted to the centromere of the chromosome, where they are essential for chromosome segregation [5]. Other specialized histones exist that are essential for development [6]. Changes in histone acetylation have been implicated in the down-regulation of a tumour suppressor gene in human breast cancer [7]. Acetylation also plays an important role in X chromosome inactivation as well as hormone-mediated transcriptional regulation [8, 9]. We propose here a novel model for histone variant gene regulation at the post-transcriptional level, which provides the groundwork to define the pathways regulating the synthesis of these variants.
11993937	Topological organization of DNA molecules in the macronucleus of hypotrichous ciliated protozoa.	The DNA in the macronucleus of a hypotrichous ciliate occurs as millions of short molecules packed into dense chromatin bodies 0.1-2 microm in diameter. We have studied by electron microscopy the organization of DNA molecules in these chromatin bodies of macronuclei lysed in water at pH 9. Proteinase K treatment of lysed macronuclei progressively releases from chromatin bodies many rosettes of DNA molecules bound at one or both ends to a central core of protein. With longer treatment with proteinase K, rosettes disappear, leaving individual free DNA molecules. We propose that, in the native state, both ends of DNA molecules are bound through telomere-binding protein to a central core to form rosettes. Many rosettes, with collapsed DNA loops, aggregate to form a chromatin body. Chromatin bodies are believed to dissociate into individual collapsed rosettes to form the granules in the forward zone of the replication band. In the rear zone of the band, the rosettes dissociate, presumably as a result of release of telomere-binding protein, which is preliminary to the replication of the DNA molecules.
9031508	Neutron scattering studies on chromatin higher-order structure.	We have been engaged in studies of the structure and condensation of chromatin into the 30 nm filament using small-angle neutron scattering. We have also used deuterated histone H1 to determine its location in the chromatin 30 nm filament. Our studies indicate that chromatin condenses with increasing ionic strength to a limiting structure that has a mass per unit length of 6-7 nucleosomes/11 nm. They also show that the linker histone H1/H5 is located in the interior of the chromatin filament, in a position compatible with its binding to the inner face of the nucleosome. Analysis of the mass per unit length as a function of H5 stoichiometry suggests that 5-7 contiguous nucleosomes need to have H5 bound before a stable higher order structure can exist.
9204873	The scaffold/matrix attachment region binding protein hnRNP-U (SAF-A) is directly bound to chromosomal DNA in vivo: a chemical cross-linking study.	The protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP-U, also known as scaffold attachment factor A, SAF-A) is an abundant component of hnRNP particles and of the nuclear matrix. Previous experiments have demonstrated that, in vitro, hnRNP-U specifically binds to scaffold/matrix attachment (S/MAR) region DNA elements and could thus be involved in higher order chromatin structure. In this paper we report on the use of chemical cross-linking to investigate whether the protein is also bound to DNA in vivo, which is a prerequisite for its presumed function in chromatin loop formation. We have improved published methods for cross-linking proteins to DNA with the aim to minimize unspecific fixation and possible contamination with RNA binding proteins. Our protocol is based on a limited cross-linking of living human cells with formaldehyde, followed by the purification of DNA/protein complexes by two consecutive cesium chloride density gradient centrifugations. Analysis of the protein constituents of these complexes shows a specific subset of cross-linked proteins with the histones as major components. By western blotting, we demonstrate that hnRNP-U is efficiently cross-linked to DNA under experimental conditions that yield DNA/protein complexes with a buoyant density equivalent to that of native chromatin. Dimethylsulfate cross-linking and limited protease digestion of the complexes was used to establish that hnRNP-U is bound directly to DNA and not via cross-linking to other proteins. This is the first direct demonstration of the in vivo DNA binding of a S/MAR specific protein and suggests a structural role of hnRNP-U in chromatin organization.
9473485	A stimulation factor for hydrolysis of ATP bound to DnaA protein, the initiator of chromosomal DNA replication in Escherichia coli.	Hydrolysis of ATP bound to DnaA protein by its intrinsic ATPase activity negatively controls chromosomal DNA replication in Escherichia coli. We developed a new in vitro assay system for ATP hydrolysis, which makes feasible a search for factors affecting the ATPase activity of DnaA protein. A crude cell extract enhanced the hydrolysis of ATP bound to DnaA protein, in a dose-dependent manner. Gel-filtration analyses revealed a single entity of the stimulation factor for the ATP hydrolysis and an apparent molecular mass of 170 kDa. The stimulation activity for ATP hydrolysis coeluted with the inactivation activity for DnaA protein initiating an oriC DNA replication, as determined by anion-exchange and gel-filtration column chromatographies. Activity of the stimulation factor required DNA and ATP. These observations suggested that IdaA protein, a previously described negative factor for DnaA protein, inactivated DnaA protein through stimulation of the hydrolysis of ATP bound to DnaA protein.
7837983	Genetic analysis of mitomycin C-hypersensitive Chinese hamster cell mutants.	The genetic diversity of Chinese hamster cell mutants exhibiting hypersensitivity to the bifunctional alkylating agent mitomycin C has been examined. The eight mutants irs3, VH4, UV1, MC5, MMC1, MMC3, MMC4 and MMS2, are between 4- and 30-fold more sensitive to mitomycin C than their respective wildtype parental lines. A number of the mutants show phenotypic similarities to cultured cells from the human cancer-prone syndrome Fanconi's anaemia. Hybrids were formed between pairs of mutants using the thioguanine/ouabain resistant (TOR) hybridization and hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine (HAT)/ouabain selection system and the mitomycin C response of pooled populations of hybrids assessed by constructing survival curves. In every case, hybrids formed between pairs of mutants exhibited a mitomycin C response indistinguishable from that of wildtype cells, indicating complementation. Therefore, the eight mutant lines examined represent eight distinct complementation groups for mitomycin C-hypersensitivity. The results are in contrast to the complementation analysis of UV-sensitive Chinese hamster cell mutants and indicate that the response of mammalian cells to mitomycin C-induced DNA damage is complex and involves a large number of genes.
8591738	[Segregation of pigment cell anomalies in Munich miniature swine (MMS) Troll crossed with German Landrace].	In order to study the inheritance of melanocytic lesions in the Munich Miniature Swine (MMS) Troll, we established the F1-, F2- and R1-generations, starting with one melanoma-bearing MMS-Troll boar and four German Landrace sows as founder animals. A total of 168 animals were born, 24 in the F1-, 111 in the F2-, 19 in the B1DL-, and 14 in the B1Troll-generation. Benign lesions with lentigoid melanocytic hyperplasia or nests of hyperplastic melanocytes like in human junctional nevus were seen in 10 (41.7%) F1-, 17 (15.3%) F2-, 2 (10.5%) B1DL-, and 6 B1Troll-animals. Malignant melanomas occurred only in the F2-(4 animals; 3.6%) and in the B1Troll-(1 animal; 7.1%) generation. The observed segreation suggests different modes of inheritance for nevi and melanomas. The segregation of nevi can be explained by a major gene model with additional modification by a polygenic component. For melanoma, a major gene model does not fit the data sufficiently. Therefore, a two-or-three-locus model with doubled or tripled recessive affected animals has to be supposed for the inheritance of melanoma. Influence of SLA-haplotypes could not be observed.
9469125	[Role concepts and role expectations of professionals in hospitals].	This article describes the results of a research about role conceptions and role expectations of physicians, nurses and patients in two general hospitals. The research reveals discrepancies between the role conceptions and role behaviour of nurses and also between the role expectations of nurses and role behaviour of physicians. In contrast, patients and physicians, for the most part, were satisfied with the role behaviour of the nurses. These discrepancies can be a barrier to collaboration between physicians and nurses and to quality of care. Discussing specific case studies is a possible strategy which can be used to influence the role conceptions and role expectations of physicians and nurses from a hospital ward.
9653450	Mechanisms determining sensitivity to cisplatin in three mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell lines.	To gain insight into factors determining the response of tumours to cisplatin, we studied pathways involved in resistance to cisplatin: drug uptake, cytoplasmic detoxification and DNA repair, in three cisplatin-sensitive Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)2 mutant cell lines. The mutant lines, CHO-MMC6, CHO-MMC1, CHO-MMS2, displayed inherent sensitivity to cisplatin (2.2, 4.1 and 10.6-fold, respectively) compared to the CHO-K1 line from which they were derived. CHO-MMS2 was the only mutant to show sensitivity to UV and this was slight (< 2-fold). None of the mutants displayed increased sensitivity to X-irradiation. The CHO-MMS2 cell line appeared to have multiple mechanisms involved in its sensitivity to cisplatin, including increased drug accumulation, decreased levels of glutathione and a decreased capacity for DNA repair. The CHO-MMC1 mutant demonstrated reduced ability for DNA repair in a host cell reactivation assay, but no difference in drug accumulation or glutathione levels compared to the parent. The CHO-MMC6 cell line was not defective in any of the mechanisms studied. These three mutant cell lines demonstrate that similar mechanisms may account for inherent sensitivity or resistance to cisplatin, and suggest that multiple mechanisms may determine the sensitivity of human tumours to cisplatin.
10526212	Genetic interactions between error-prone and error-free postreplication repair pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	Evidence obtained from recent studies supports the existence of an error-free postreplication repair (PRR) and a mutagenesis pathway within the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD6 DNA repair group. The MMS2 gene is the only known yeast gene involved in error-free PRR that, when mutated, significantly increases the spontaneous mutation rate. In this study, the mutational spectrum of the mms2 mutator was determined and compared to the wild type strain. In addition, mutagenenic effects and genetic interactions of the mms2 mutator and rev3 anti-mutator were examined with respect to forward mutations, frameshift reversions as well as amber and ochre suppressions. It was concluded from these results that the mms2 mutator phenotype is largely dependent on the functional REV3 gene. The synergistic effects of mms2 and rev3 mutations towards killing by a variety of DNA-damaging agents ruled out the possibility that MMS2 simply acts to suppress REV3 activity and favored the hypothesis that MMS2 and REV3 form two alternative subpathways within the RAD6 DNA repair pathway. Taken together, we propose that two pathways represented by MMS2 and REV3 deal with a similar range of endogenous and environmental DNA damage but with different biological consequences, namely, error-free repair and mutagenesis, respectively.
10794173	UBC13, a DNA-damage-inducible gene, is a member of the error-free postreplication repair pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	The Ubc13 protein was recently identified for its unique role in ubiquitin (Ub) chain assembly at the Ub Lys-63 residue instead of the conventional Lys-48 residue. This activity requires Ubc13 to form a complex with Mms2 and indeed ubc13 and mms2 mutations have been shown elsewhere to be epistatic with respect to UV sensitivity. The MMS2 gene is known to be a member of the error-free DNA postreplication repair (PRR) pathway. By contrast, the Ub Lys-63 residue has been previously implicated in the error-prone PRR pathway, since yeast cells carrying the ubiK63R mutation are defective in UV-induced mutagenesis. In the present study, we attempted to define the role of UBC13 within the PRR pathway. We found that the ubc13 mutation is epistatic to mms2 and rad6, confirming that UBC13 belongs to the PRR-pathway. We also found that ubc13 is synergistic to the error-prone PRR pathway mutation rev3, indicating that UBC13 is in a pathway alternative to REV3 mutagenesis. The ubc13 mutant displays up to a 30-fold increase in the spontaneous mutation rate, and this increase is largely REV3 dependent. In addition, UV-induced mutagenesis is fully functional in the ubc13 mutant. These results together demonstrate that UBC13 is a member of the error-free PRR pathway. The involvement of UBC13 in cellular tolerance to DNA-damage is further implicated by our finding that the UBC13 transcript level is increased up to 6-fold in response to DNA-damage.
10880451	Two RING finger proteins mediate cooperation between ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in DNA repair.	Two ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, RAD6 and the heteromeric UBC13-MMS2 complex, have been implicated in post-replicative DNA damage repair in yeast. Here we provide a mechanistic basis for cooperation between the two enzymes. We show that two chromatin-associated RING finger proteins, RAD18 and RAD5, play a central role in mediating physical contacts between the members of the RAD6 pathway. RAD5 recruits the UBC13-MMS2 complex to DNA by means of its RING finger domain. Moreover, RAD5 association with RAD18 brings UBC13-MMS2 into contact with the RAD6-RAD18 complex. Interaction between the two RING finger proteins thus promotes the formation of a heteromeric complex in which the two distinct ubiquitin-conjugating activities of RAD6 and UBC13-MMS2 can be closely coordinated. Surprisingly, UBC13 and MMS2 are largely cytosolic proteins, but DNA damage triggers their redistribution to the nucleus. These findings suggest a mechanism by which the activity of this DNA repair pathway could be regulated.
10880470	MPH1, a yeast gene encoding a DEAH protein, plays a role in protection of the genome from spontaneous and chemically induced damage.	We have characterized the MPH1 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. mph1 mutants display a spontaneous mutator phenotype. Homologs were found in archaea and in the EST libraries of Drosophila, mouse, and man. Mph1 carries the signature motifs of the DEAH family of helicases. Selected motifs were shown to be necessary for MPH1 function by introducing missense mutations. Possible indirect effects on translation and splicing were excluded by demonstrating nuclear localization of the protein and splicing proficiency of the mutant. A mutation spectrum did not show any conspicuous deviations from wild type except for an underrepresentation of frameshift mutations. The mutator phenotype was dependent on REV3 and RAD6. The mutant was sensitive to MMS, EMS, 4-NQO, and camptothecin, but not to UV light and X rays. Epistasis analyses were carried out with representative mutants from various repair pathways (msh6, mag1, apn1, rad14, rad52, rad6, mms2, and rev3). No epistatic interactions were found, either for the spontaneous mutator phenotype or for MMS, EMS, and 4-NQO sensitivity. mph1 slightly increased the UV sensitivity of mms2, rad6, and rad14 mutants, but no effect on X-ray sensitivity was observed. These data suggest that MPH1 is not part of a hitherto known repair pathway. Possible functions are discussed.
11456202	Fate of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium DT 104, and Listeria monocytogenes in fresh meat decontamination fluids at 4 and 10 degrees C.	Bacterial pathogens may colonize meat plants and increase food safety risks following survival, stress hardening, or proliferation in meat decontamination fluids (washings). The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium DT 104, and Listeria monocytogenes to survive or grow in spray-washing fluids from fresh beef top rounds sprayed with water (10 or 85 degrees C) or acid solutions (2% lactic or acetic acid, 55 degrees C) during storage of the washings at 4 or 10 degrees C in air to simulate plant conditions. Inoculated Salmonella Typhimurium DT 104 (5.4 +/- 0.1 log CFU/ml) died off in lactate (pH 2.4 +/- 0.1) and acetate (pH 3.1 +/- 0.2) washings by 2 days at either storage temperature. In contrast, inoculated E. coli O157:H7 (5.2 +/- 0.1 log CFU/ml) and L. monocytogenes (5.4 +/- 0.1 log CFU/ml) survived in lactate washings for at least 2 days and in acetate washings for at least 7 and 4 days, respectively; their survival was better in acidic washings stored at 4 degrees C than at 10 degrees C. All inoculated pathogens survived in nonacid (pH > 6.0) washings, but their fate was different. E. coli O157:H7 did not grow at either temperature in water washings, whereas Salmonella Typhimurium DT 104 failed to multiply at 4 degrees C but increased by approximately 2 logs at 10 degrees C. L. monocytogenes multiplied (0.6 to 1.3 logs) at both temperatures in water washings. These results indicated that bacterial pathogens may survive for several days in acidic, and proliferate in water, washings of meat, serving as potential cross-contamination sources, if pathogen niches are established in the plant. The responses of surviving pathogens in meat decontamination waste fluids to acid or other stresses need to be addressed to better evaluate potential food safety risks.
11460167	TAK1 is a ubiquitin-dependent kinase of MKK and IKK.	TRAF6 is a signal transducer that activates IkappaB kinase (IKK) and Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) in response to pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). IKK activation by TRAF6 requires two intermediary factors, TRAF6-regulated IKK activator 1 (TRIKA1) and TRIKA2 (ref. 5). TRIKA1 is a dimeric ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex composed of Ubc13 and Uev1A (or the functionally equivalent Mms2). This Ubc complex, together with TRAF6, catalyses the formation of a Lys 63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitin chain that mediates IKK activation through a unique proteasome-independent mechanism. Here we report the purification and identification of TRIKA2, which is composed of TAK1, TAB1 and TAB2, a protein kinase complex previously implicated in IKK activation through an unknown mechanism. We find that the TAK1 kinase complex phosphorylates and activates IKK in a manner that depends on TRAF6 and Ubc13-Uev1A. Moreover, the activity of TAK1 to phosphorylate MKK6, which activates the JNK-p38 kinase pathway, is directly regulated by K63-linked polyubiquitination. We also provide evidence that TRAF6 is conjugated by the K63 polyubiquitin chains. These results indicate that ubiquitination has an important regulatory role in stress response pathways, including those of IKK and JNK.
11522817	The srs2 suppressor of UV sensitivity acts specifically on the RAD5- and MMS2-dependent branch of the RAD6 pathway.	The SRS2 gene encodes a helicase that affects recombination, gene conversion and DNA damage repair in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Loss-of-function mutations in srs2 suppress the extreme sensitivity towards UV radiation of rad6 and rad18 mutants, both of which are impaired in post-replication DNA repair and damage-induced mutagenesis. A sub-branch within the RAD6 pathway is mediated by RAD5, UBC13 and MMS2, and a comprehensive analysis of the srs2 effect on other known members of the RAD6 pathway reported here now demonstrates that suppression by srs2 is specific for mutants within this RAD5-dependent sub-system. Further evidence for the concerted action of RAD5 with UBC13 and MMS2 in DNA damage repair is given by examination of the effects of cell cycle stage as well as deletion of other repair systems on the activity of post-replication repair. Finally, it is shown that MMS2, like UBC13 and many other repair genes, is transcriptionally up-regulated in response to DNA damage. The data presented here support the notion that RAD5, UBC13 and MMS2 encode an ensemble of genetically and physically interacting repair factors within the RAD6 pathway that is coordinately affected by SRS2.
11917106	Identification of a protein essential for a major pathway used by human cells to avoid UV- induced DNA damage.	"When DNA replication stalls at a fork-blocking lesion, cells use damage tolerance pathways to continue replication. One pathway, ""translesion synthesis,"" involves specialized DNA polymerases that can use damaged DNA as a template. Translesion synthesis can result in mutations (i.e., can be error-prone), but it can also be error-free. An alternative pathway has been hypothesized (sometimes called ""damage avoidance""), by which cells make temporary use of an undamaged copy of the blocked sequence as a template, i.e., the newly synthesized daughter strand of the sister duplex or the allelic copy. This pathway is error-free. Evidence of the use of the daughter strand of the sister duplex as a template in intact mammalian cells has not been available heretofore. To determine whether hMms2, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme-like protein, plays a critical role in such damage avoidance, a human fibroblast cell strain in which both error-prone translesion synthesis and error-free damage avoidance can be detected and quantified simultaneously, and several derivative strains in which expression of hMms2 protein had been eliminated or greatly decreased, were compared for their ability to avoid translesion synthesis past UV(254nm)-induced DNA photoproducts. Loss of hMms2 protein eliminated the ability of the latter strains to use an allelic copy of a target gene for damage avoidance, i.e., to produce a wild-type gene from two nonfunctional allelic copies of that gene. Molecular analysis of the wild-type gene showed that this process involves gene conversion unassociated with crossing-over. That the loss of hMms2 also eliminated use of the daughter strand of the sister duplex as a template for damage avoidance could be inferred from the fact that the frequency of mutations induced by UV in the single copy HPRT gene of the derivative strains was significantly higher than that observed in the parental strain. These data indicate that hMMS2 is essential for human cells to carry out damage avoidance by using either type of homolog, and that damage avoidance and translesion synthesis are alternative pathways for tolerating fork-blocking photoproducts."
12460218	Information and support for women following the primary treatment of breast cancer.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the need for, use of and satisfaction with information and support following primary treatment of breast cancer. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. PARTICIPANTS: Cohort of 266 surviving women diagnosed with breast cancer over a 25-month period at a tertiary hospital, Adelaide, Australia. Time since diagnosis ranged from 6 to 30 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Need for, use of and satisfaction with information and support. RESULTS: Women reported high levels of need for information about a variety of issues following breast cancer treatment. Ninety-four percentage reported a high level of need for information about one or more issues, particularly recognizing a recurrence, chances of cure and risk to family members of breast cancer. However, few women (2-32%) reported receiving such information. The most frequently used source of information was the surgeon followed by television, newspapers and books. The most frequently used source of support was family followed by friends and the surgeon. Few women (<7%) used formal support services or the Internet. Women were very satisfied with the information and support that they received from the surgeon and other health professionals but reported receiving decreasing amounts of information and support from them over time. CONCLUSIONS: Women experience a high need for information about breast cancer related issues following primary treatment of breast cancer. These needs remain largely unmet as few women receive information about issues that concern them. The role of the surgeon and other health professionals is critical in narrowing the gap between needing and receiving information.
14562038	The Chfr mitotic checkpoint protein functions with Ubc13-Mms2 to form Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains.	We recently described a novel checkpoint pathway that functions early in mitosis to delay chromosome condensation in response to microtubule poisons. The only gene implicated so far in this checkpoint pathway is chfr, whose protein product contains a RING domain and has ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro. The significance of this activity in vivo is unclear. A recent report suggested that the Chfr protein targets itself for proteasome-dependent degradation in mitotic cells through autoubiquitination. However, we observe that in mitosis Chfr exhibits a phosphorylation-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift with no change in overall protein levels. Further analysis of its ubiquitin ligase activity revealed that Chfr can catalyse the formation of noncanonical Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains with Ubc13-Mms2 acting as the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Ubc13-Mms2 and Lys63-polyubiquitin chains are not associated with targeting proteins to the proteasome, but rather with signaling cellular stress. We propose that Chfr may have a role in signaling the presence of mitotic stress induced by microtubule poisons.
8005829	Differential action on cancer and normal tissue by adrenochrome monoaminoguanidine methanesulfonate and cytochrome C combined with radiotherapy.	PURPOSE: The possibility that radioprotective effects on potent natural killer (NK) cells by adrenochrome monoaminoguanidine methanesulfonate+cytochrome C during radiotherapy (RT) for lung cancer might result in the radiosensitization of human lung cancer cells in vivo is examined. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Human lung cancer xenografts in the right hind legs of KSN mice (10 weeks old) were locally irradiated with 20 Gy of X ray. Adrenochrome monoaminogluanidine methanesulfonate (AMM) (10 mg/kg/day) and/or cytochrome C (CCC) (5 mg/kg/day) were given intraperitoneally immediately before or after RT, followed by daily administration for 4 days. Natural killer activities of host splenocytes were also tested with the standard 51Cr releasing assay with YAC-1 cells as target cells. In a clinical study, 65 patients with lung cancer were treated with more than 50 Gy of RT with or without combination with AMM+CCC, OK-432 or AMM+CCC+OK-432. Before and after RT, lymphocyte subsets in the peripheral blood were examined with dichromatic analysis using an Ortho Spectrum IIIFCM system and fluorescent MABs. In this study, the change in the absolute number of each subset was investigated. RESULTS: Adrenochrome monoaminoguanidine methanesulfonate+cytochrome C augumented NK activity in KSN nude mice, protected potent NK cells in patients with lung cancer against RT and sensitized the human lung cancer xenografts to RT. CONCLUSION: Adrenochrome monoaminoguanidine methanesulfonate+cytochrome C may have the potential as a differential modulator of radiosensitivity of normal tissues and of tumors.
8683298	Intratumoral distribution of tritiated-FDG in breast carcinoma: correlation between Glut-1 expression and FDG uptake.	UNLABELLED: Increased expression of glucose transporters is frequently associated with transformation and is often found in malignant tumors. To assess the relationship between cellular glucose transporter Glut-1 (brain/erythrocyte) and FDG uptake in malignant tumors we studied the expression of Glut-1 and 3H-FDG uptake in a syngeneic rat mammary cancer (RMC), an animal tumor model that closely mimics human breast carcinoma. METHODS: Tumors of 1-9 RMT cell line were grown in female Lewis rats and were studied by immunoperoxidase staining with anti-Glut-1 antibodies, macro- and microautoradiography and densitometry following intravenous injection of 3H-FDG. RESULTS: Most of the cancer cells contained Glut-1 positive cytoplasmic granules. Cells with strongly stained cell membrane were mainly observed in areas of intensive intraductal proliferation and high tumor cell density. No staining was observed in necrotic areas, connective tissue stroma or granulation tissue. FDG uptake in areas of high cancer cell density was consistently higher than average tumor uptake. Silver grain counts were 31 +/- 8/0.023 mm2 in regions of viable cancer cells, and were higher as compared to 10 +/-7 counted in necrotic or 8 +/- 8 in connective tissue areas (p = 0.0001). Densitometry of the autoradiograms and of the histochemically stained consecutive sections showed positive correlation between estimates of FDG uptake and the intensity of staining of the Glut-1 antigen (r=0.3-0.6; p=0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate significant positive correlation between the expression of the facilitative glucose transporter Glut-1 and FDG accumulation in viable cancer cells in the syngeneic rat breast cancer. They suggest that the regulation of FDG uptake may be mediated by Glut-1 and the heterogeneous expression of Glut-1 and tracer uptake may reflect localized variations in the metabolic conditions.
10688907	Rat strain-specific actions of 17beta-estradiol in the mammary gland: correlation between estrogen-induced lobuloalveolar hyperplasia and susceptibility to estrogen-induced mammary cancers.	The genetically related ACI and Copenhagen (COP) rat strains display diametrically opposed susceptibilities to mammary cancer development when treated chronically with 17beta-estradiol (E2). Here, we compare the actions of E2 on cell proliferation and lobuloalveolar development in the mammary glands of female ACI and COP rats. After 12 wk of E2 treatment, the mammary glands of ACI rats exhibited a significantly greater proliferative response to E2, compared with COP rats, as evidenced by quantification of S phase fraction and development of lobuloalveolar hyperplasia. Focal regions of atypical epithelial hyperplasia were observed in ACI, but not COP, rats. These strain differences were not because of differences in circulating E2, progesterone or, prolactin. Two-thirds of the induced mammary cancers in ACI rats exhibited aneuploidy. The E2-induced mammary cancers regressed when hormone treatment was discontinued, indicating that they were estrogen-dependent. Progesterone receptor was expressed by the great majority of epithelial cells within the E2-induced atypical hyperplastic foci and the mammary carcinomas, suggesting a link between these lesions. These data demonstrate a correlation between E2 action in the induction of mammary cell proliferation and atypical epithelial hyperplasia and genetically conferred susceptibility to E2-induced mammary cancers.
10924462	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD6 group is composed of an error-prone and two error-free postreplication repair pathways.	The RAD6 postreplication repair and mutagenesis pathway is the only major radiation repair pathway yet to be extensively characterized. It has been previously speculated that the RAD6 pathway consists of two parallel subpathways, one error free and another error prone (mutagenic). Here we show that the RAD6 group genes can be exclusively divided into three rather than two independent subpathways represented by the RAD5, POL30, and REV3 genes; the REV3 pathway is largely mutagenic, whereas the RAD5 and the POL30 pathways are deemed error free. Mutants carrying characteristic mutations in each of the three subpathways are phenotypically indistinguishable from a single mutant such as rad18, which is defective in the entire RAD6 postreplication repair/tolerance pathway. Furthermore, the rad18 mutation is epistatic to all single or combined mutations in any of the above three subpathways. Our data also suggest that MMS2 and UBC13 play a key role in coordinating the response of the error-free subpathways; Mms2 and Ubc13 form a complex required for a novel polyubiquitin chain assembly, which probably serves as a signal transducer to promote both RAD5 and POL30 error-free postreplication repair pathways. The model established by this study will facilitate further research into the molecular mechanisms of postreplication repair and translesion DNA synthesis. In view of the high degree of sequence conservation of the RAD6 pathway genes among all eukaryotes, the model presented in this study may also apply to mammalian cells and predicts links to human diseases.
11406273	Molecular cloning and functional characterization of two murine cDNAs which encode Ubc variants involved in DNA repair and mutagenesis.	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Ubc) variants share structural similarity with Ubcs but lack the essential cysteine residue required to form a thioester bond with ubiquitin. Yeast Mms2 is a Ubc variant and plays an important role in error-free DNA postreplication repair to protect cells from killing by DNA damaging agents and mutagenesis. Ironically, one of two known Mms2 homologs, CROC1, has been linked to cell immortalization and tumorigenesis. To further investigate cellular roles played by mammalian Mms2 homologs, we report here the molecular cloning, tissue distribution and functional characterization of two mouse cDNAs encoding mMMS2 and mCROC1. Unlike human CROC1, the mCROC1 gene does not encode two alternative transcripts in most tissues. Instead, nonoverlapping sequences were found in two distinct cDNA clones that together would constitute a full-length open reading frame homologous to CROC1B. Both mMMS2 and the C-terminal mCROC1 core domain are able to complement the yeast mms2 mutant functionally and are able to interact with Ubc13 in a yeast two-hybrid assay, indicating that they are true yeast Mms2 homologs and may play a similar role in DNA postreplication repair. We propose several hypotheses to reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations regarding roles of the two mammalian Mms2 homologs in tumorigenesis and carcinogenesis.
11712289	Intramural and pericapillary distribution of lipids in gingival tissue of patients with carbohydrate-induced hyperglyceridemia.	Gingival biopsy was performed on 16 patients with carbohydrate-induced hyperglyceridemia, in the attempt to discover histological abnormalities in the capillaries. For comparison, similar studies were also made on four patients with essential familial hypercholesteremia, on five whose hyperglyceridemia had been kept under control by a low carbohydrate diet for 6 to 26 months, and on eight healthy, normolipemic subjects. Variable amounts of Oil Red O-stainable lipid material were demonstrated both in and around the capillary wall in 13 of the 16 untreated hyperglyceridemic patients. Little or no such lipid-staining material was demonstrated in the biopsy material obtained from the remaining groups of subjects so studied. Microangiopathy of the pre-diabetic and diabetic type characterized by capillary basement membrane thickening was not demonstrated in any of the hyperlipemic patients in this series. Evidence is presented to support the concept that a sustained chylomicronemia is the primary factor in the production of the intramural and pericapillary collection of Oil Red O-staining lipids in these hyperglyceridemic patients.
12509272	The beta-lactamase motif in Snm1 is required for repair of DNA double-strand breaks caused by interstrand crosslinks in S. cerevisiae.	The SNM1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is specific for repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). We report that the SNM1 gene functions in steps needed for the reformation of chromosomal DNA after double-strand breaks (DSBs) made in the process of ICL repair. However, SNM1 function is not needed for repair of HO endonuclease-generated DSBs. Therefore, the function of the SNM1 gene appears to act in the processing of the intermediates of the DSB repair, since the rate and extent of DSB appearance after ICL formation is normal in mutants lacking SNM1 function. The action of the SNM1 gene does not appear to depend on homologous recombination, but it does depend on an intact beta-lactamase domain conserved with Artemis, a protein required for processing of V(D)J recombination intermediates.
7507033	Tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy in breast cancer. Current status.	Tamoxifen retains its place as the most important drug in the management of human breast cancer. As time passes, it becomes clear that this drug is no longer to be regarded as a simple antiestrogen, since it modifies other cellular signalling mechanisms, giving scientific credence to the growth inhibitory effects observed in estrogen receptor-negative tumours. With the role of tamoxifen in breast cancer being well documented, recent interest has concentrated on its now proven efficacy in adjuvant treatment of patients with the disease in its early stages, and on its prophylactic role in women at high risk of developing the disease. For tamoxifen to have any role at all in the latter situation, it must be demonstrably safe, and here again the toxicity profile is now much better understood.
9149035	A comparison of breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers reported to the National Cancer Data Base and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program.	"BACKGROUND: The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) is an information resource and program evaluation tool of the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer and the American Cancer Society that uses a hospital-based cancer reporting system. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program is a population-based registry program of the National Cancer Institute. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the aggregate NCDB data for selected cancer types from a given year with comparable SEER data. METHODS: SEER data from 1992 on 18,322 breast, 13,427 colorectal, 15,276 lung, and 21,501 prostate cancers were compared with NCDB data on 96,323 breast, 69,456 colorectal, 108,702 lung, and 107,690 prostate cancers. RESULTS: Similar levels of data completeness were observed. The NCDB data tended to contain less complete information about the Spanish or Hispanic ethnicity of patients. Tumor grade data tended to be incomplete in both series. Stage information about lung and prostate cancer was more often missing in SEER data. Patient age, race, and gender in NCDB data differed little from corresponding SEER data, except that SEER data reported a greater proportion of patients in the ""other"" race category that included Asian-Americans and American Indians. Tumor laterality, anatomic site, tumor grade, and types of surgical treatment were similar in the NCDB and SEER data. Radical mastectomy was performed in 49.4% of SEER breast cancer cases compared with 49.2% of NCDB cases. Cancer-directed surgery was observed less often among SEER prostate cancer cases than among NCDB cases. The NCDB data also indicated greater use of radiation therapy than the SEER data for the four types of cancer reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: The 1992 NCDB data, in aggregate, described patient and disease treatment characteristics and patterns that differed only marginally from those described in the SEER data from the same year."
11504715	Noncovalent interaction between ubiquitin and the human DNA repair protein Mms2 is required for Ubc13-mediated polyubiquitination.	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variants share significant sequence similarity with typical E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating) enzymes of the protein ubiquitination pathway but lack their characteristic active site cysteine residue. The MMS2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes one such ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant that is involved in the error-free DNA postreplicative repair pathway through its association with Ubc13, an E2. The Mms2-Ubc13 heterodimer is capable of linking ubiquitin molecules to one another through an isopeptide bond between the C terminus and Lys-63. Using highly purified components, we show here that the human forms of Mms2 and Ubc13 associate into a heterodimer that is stable over a range of conditions. The ubiquitin-thiol ester form of the heterodimer can be produced by the direct activation of its Ubc13 subunit with E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme) or by the association of Mms2 with the Ubc13-ubiquitin thiol ester. The activated heterodimer is capable of transferring its covalently bound ubiquitin to Lys-63 of an untethered ubiquitin molecule, resulting in diubiquitin as the predominant species. In (1)H (15)N HSQC ((1)H (15)N heteronuclear single quantum coherence) NMR experiments, we have mapped the surface determinants of tethered and untethered ubiquitin that interact with Mms2 and Ubc13 in both their monomeric and dimeric forms. These results have identified a surface of untethered ubiquitin that interacts with Mms2 in the monomeric and heterodimeric form. Furthermore, the C-terminal tail of ubiquitin does not participate in this interaction. These results suggest that the role of Mms2 is to correctly orient either a target-bound or untethered ubiquitin molecule such that its Lys-63 is placed proximally to the C terminus of the ubiquitin molecule that is linked to the active site of Ubc13.
11805321	mda-5: An interferon-inducible putative RNA helicase with double-stranded RNA-dependent ATPase activity and melanoma growth-suppressive properties.	Human melanoma cells can be reprogrammed to terminally differentiate and irreversibly lose proliferative capacity by appropriate pharmacological manipulation. Subtraction hybridization identified melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (mda-5) as a gene induced during differentiation, cancer reversion, and programmed cell death (apoptosis). This gene contains both a caspase recruitment domain and putative DExH group RNA helicase domains. Atypical helicase motifs of MDA-5 deviate from consensus sequences but are well conserved in a potentially new group of cloned and hypothetical proteins. mda-5 is an early response gene inducible by IFN and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, responding predominantly to IFN-beta. Protein kinase C activation by mezerein further augments mda-5 expression induced by IFN-beta. Expression of mda-5 is controlled transcriptionally by IFN-beta, and the MDA-5 protein localizes in the cytoplasm. mda-5 displays RNA-dependent ATPase activity, and ectopic expression of mda-5 in human melanoma cells inhibits colony formation. In these contexts, mda-5 may function as a mediator of IFN-induced growth inhibition and/or apoptosis. MDA-5 is a double-stranded RNA-dependent ATPase that contains both a caspase recruitment domain and RNA helicase motifs, with a confirmed association with growth and differentiation in human melanoma cells.
7525755	The Oncology Nursing Society: commitment and activities promoting cancer pain relief.	The primary mission of the ONS is promoting excellence in oncology nursing. In its efforts to accomplish this mission, the undertreatment of cancer pain has emerged as a significant issue for clinicians, educators, researchers, and administrators involved in the care of people with cancer. In an effort to promote cancer pain relief, the ONS contributes human, administrative, and financial resources from its existing organizational structure, personnel, and volunteers in the variety of ways described above. The structure of the ONS enables it to support the goal of cancer pain relief from the broadest of policy-making activities nationally to the provision of care by a nurse to a patient and family. The ONS Position Paper on Cancer Pain, other position papers and statements, adopted resolutions, and the strategic planning process will continue to guide the ONS's commitment and contributions to promoting cancer pain relief.
7925526	Cellular expression of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in normal kidney structures and in renal cancer. Possible significance in immune response and in the clinicopathological correlation.	In this study we investigated the presence of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on renal cell cancer in 16 patients who underwent nephrectomy. In all cases, normal renal tissues presented ICAM-1 on the parietal epithelial cells lining Bowman's capsule while neither the visceral epithelium nor the glomerular endothelium were stained. The epithelial proximal and distal tubular cells were stained poorly (5 +/- 3 positive tubular cross sections/mm2). No renal cells were stained by the monoclonal antibody for LFA-1. In contrast, in renal cancer tissue we found 6 cases, negative for ICAM-1 and the others positive with a mean number of positive tubular cross sections of 52 +/- 37/mm2. In 10 cases staining with LFA-1 antibody was negative, while for the other cases the mean number of positive tubular cross sections was 11 +/- 8/mm2. Our results suggest that the expression of ICAM-1 and LFA-1 on the surface of malignant cells may explain the unusual clinical aspects of renal cell carcinoma, its association with the immune system, and clarify certain aspects of immunotherapy.
9705497	The products of the yeast MMS2 and two human homologs (hMMS2 and CROC-1) define a structurally and functionally conserved Ubc-like protein family.	Eukaryotic genes encoding ubiquitin-congugating enzyme (Ubc)-like proteins have been isolated from both human and yeast cells. The CROC-1 gene was isolated by its ability to transactivate c- fos expression in cell culture through a tandem repeat enhancer sequence. The yeast MMS2 gene was cloned by its ability to complement the methyl methanesulfonate sensitivity of the mms2-1 mutant and was later shown to be involved in DNA post-replication repair. We report here the identification of a human MMS2 ( hMMS2 ) cDNA encoding a novel human Ubc-like protein. hMMS2 and CROC-1 share >90% amino acid sequence identity, but their DNA probes hybridize to distinct transcripts. hMMS2 and CROC-1 also share approximately 50% identity and 75% similarity with the entire length of yeast Mms2. Unlike CROC-1 , whose transcript appears to be elevated in all tumor cell lines examined, the hMMS2 transcript is only elevated in some tumor cell lines. Collectively, these results indicate that eukaryotic cells may contain a highly conserved family of Ubc-like proteins that play roles in diverse cellular processes, ranging from DNA repair to signal transduction and cell differentiation. The hMMS2 and CROC-1 genes are able to functionally complement the yeast mms2 defects with regard to sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and spontaneous mutagenesis. Conversely, both MMS2 and hMMS2 were able to transactivate a c- fos - CAT reporter gene in Rat-1 cells in a transient co-transfection assay. We propose that either these proteins function in a common cellular process, such as DNA repair, or they exert their diverse biological roles through a similar biochemical interaction relative to ubiquitination.
12788910	A locus for autosomal recessive idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism on chromosome 19p13.3.	Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) is traditionally established by 1) the absence of spontaneous pubertal development by age 18 yr and 2) low sex steroids with inappropriately low gonadotropins in the absence of any functional or anatomic cause. To identify a novel disease locus for IHH, a genome wide scan was performed on a large, consanguineous Saudi family with 6 affected individuals. Linkage over a 1.06 Mb interval on chromosome 19p13.3 was established with a maximal two point LOD score of 5.17. Because numerous genes and hypothetical proteins are mapped to this region, further studies will be necessary to determine the precise genetic defect in this family.
12949806	CYP17 polymorphisms in relation to risks of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia: a population-based study in China.	Because androgens likely play a key role in prostate growth and prostate cancer development, variants of genes involved in androgen biosynthesis may be related to prostate cancer risk. The enzyme P450c17alpha, encoded by the CYP17 gene, catalyzes the conversion of progesterone and pregnenolone into precursors of potent androgens. In the 5' promoter region of the CYP17 gene, a T (A1 allele) to C substitution (A2 allele) has been hypothesized to increase CYP17 gene expression, resulting in higher levels of androgens. To investigate a possible role of CYP17 in prostate diseases, we evaluated the risk of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in relation to variation in CYP17 genotype in a population-based case-control study conducted in Shanghai, China. The study included 174 prostate cancer cases, 182 BPH cases and 274 population controls. We observed no statistically significant overall associations of CYP17 genotypes with prostate cancer risk, although associations of the A1/A1 (odds ratio (OR) =1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-2.48) and A1/A2 (OR 1.41, 95% CI 0.91-2.17) genotypes with prostate cancer were suggested. A similar association of the A1/A1 genotype with BPH was suggested. We found no associations of CYP17 genotypes with serum sex hormone levels or other biomarkers after correction for multiple comparisons. Large population-based studies are needed to clarify whether CYP17 plays a role in prostate cancer risk and whether genotype effects vary in different racial/ethnic and other subgroups.
8120177	Perceptions of colorectal cancer in a socioeconomically disadvantaged population.	This study examined 500 low socioeconomic adults' perceptions and practices regarding bowel cancer. At least 20 percent of respondents incorrectly believed homosexual men are more likely to develop bowel cancer, exercising regularly will not affect bowel cancer, bowel cancer does not run in families, and eating foods high in fat does not increase bowel cancer risks. Approximately 7 in 10 respondents did not perceive themselves as more susceptible to developing bowel cancer even though the same number of respondents acknowledged that poor people are more likely to develop bowel cancer. The majority (54 percent) believed that if you develop bowel cancer, it will kill you. The majority of respondents did not believe that fecal occult blood tests could help save their lives if they had bowel cancer since 90 percent perceived bowel cancer as incurable even if found early. The main barriers to screening for bowel cancer identified by the respondents were: being too embarrassed to have a proctoscopic exam (77%), not wanting to know if they had bowel cancer (78%), preferring to die rather than have their bowel removed for cancer (80%), and trouble with transportation (81%). Thirty percent of the respondents had personally done a stool occult blood test and the same number claimed they had a proctoscopic exam. The results of this survey indicate that there is considerable room for improvement in knowledge, perceptions, and practices of economically disadvantaged subjects regarding bowel cancer.
9166947	Measurements of tissue polypeptide-specific antigen and prostate-specific antigen in prostate cancer patients under intermittent androgen suppression therapy.	The present study evaluated serial serum measurements of tissue polypeptide-specific antigen (TPS) in comparison with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for assessment of tumour progression in patients with advanced prostate cancer receiving intermittent androgen suppression therapy (IAS). Twenty-three men were recruited into an IAS trial consisting of an initial 8 months of androgen suppression, followed by cycles of treatment cessation and resumption of therapy upon increases of PSA > 20 ng ml(-1) to prolong the hormone responsiveness of the tumour cells. Periods of androgen suppression resulted in reversible reduction in serum testosterone (< 1.8 nmol I(-1)) and PSA (< 4 ng ml(-1)) and decreases in tumour volume (mean reduction for first cycle 24 +/- 10%), indicating partial growth arrest and apoptotic regression of the tumours. In contrast to PSA values, non-specifically elevated TPS values were found in 8 of 23 patients. In 15 of 23 patients, TPS fell during periods of apoptotic tumour regression and increased simultaneously with testosterone and preceded the increases in PSA by 2 months during the period of treatment cessation. Although TPS represents a highly sensitive marker of tumour proliferation in this IAS clinical model of controlled tumour regression and regrowth, its low specificity compared with PSA limits its usefulness to monitoring of prostate cancer patients with proven absence of non-specific elevations of this marker.
10857603	De novo peptide sequencing by two-dimensional fragment correlation mass spectrometry.	A novel concept of two-dimensional fragment correlation mass spectrometry and its application to peptide sequencing is described. The daughter ion (MS2) spectrum of a peptide contains the sequence information of the peptide. However, deciphering the MS2 spectrum, and thus deriving the peptide sequence is complex because of the difficulty in distinguishing the N-terminal fragments (e.g., b series) from the C-terminal fragments (e.g., y series). By taking a granddaughter ion (MS3) spectrum of a particular daughter ion, all fragment ions of the opposite terminus are eliminated in the MS3 spectrum. However, some internal fragments of the peptide will appear in the MS3 spectrum. Because internal fragments are rarely present in the MS2 spectrum, the intersection (a spectrum containing peaks that are present in both spectra) of the MS2 and MS3 spectra should contain only fragments of the same terminal type. A two-dimensional plot of the MS2 spectrum versus the intersection spectra (2-D fragment correlation mass spectrum) often gives enough information to derive the complete sequence of a peptide. This paper describes this novel technique and its application in sequencing cytochrome c and apomyoglobin. For a tryptic digest of cytochrome c, approximately 78% of the protein sequence was determined. For the Glu-C/tryptic digest of apomyoglobin, approximately 66% of the protein sequence was determined.
10960840	Estrogen receptor gene expression and its relation to the estrogen-inducible HSP27 heat shock protein in hormone refractory prostate cancer.	BACKGROUND: The recent discovery of the classical estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in androgen-insensitive prostate cancer has shed new light on the role of estrogens in endocrine therapy failure. To get more information on downstream events of estrogen signaling in these tumors, we investigated the relation between ERalpha gene expression, and the estrogen-inducible heat shock protein HSP27 in recurrent prostatic adenocarcinomas. METHODS: Palliative transurethral resection specimens from 50 patients with androgen-insensitive disease were submitted for study. Messenger RNA in situ hybridization for the ERalpha and immunohistochemistry of the HSP27 protein were performed on adjacent sections of an equal number of prostate cancer tissue with and without ERalpha protein expression. RESULTS: Cancerous lesions lacking the nuclear ERalpha at the protein level revealed ERalpha mRNA expression in 15 of 25 cases (60%). A coordinate expression of ERalpha mRNA and HSP27 was observed in 33 of 40 cases (83%), although a significant correlation between ERalpha protein and HSP27 expression was not obtained. Conversely, 90% of neoplastic lesions without detectable levels of ERalpha mRNA and protein also lacked HSP27 immunoreactivity. CONCLUSIONS: ERalpha gene expression at the mRNA level significantly correlated with the immunoprofile of the estrogen-inducible HSP27 protein in androgen-insensitive prostatic adenocarcinomas. This may indicate that these tumors harbor functional active estrogen receptors promoting transcriptional activity of the HSP27 gene. Determination of the receptor status by immunohistochemistry is unable to identify neoplastic lesions with established ERalpha mRNA expression in a substantial number of cases. HSP27 may be an additional surrogate biomarker for estrogen-regulated growth in androgen-insensitive prostate cancer.
11590065	Ubiquitylation in plants: a post-genomic look at a post-translational modification.	In this article, we summarize Arabidopsis genes encoding ubiquitin, ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) and an additional selected set of proteins related to ubiquitylation. We emphasize comparisons to components from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with occasional reference to animals. Among the E1 and E2s, Arabidopsis usually has two to four probable orthologs to one yeast gene. Also, Arabidopsis has genes with no likely ortholog in yeast, although they often have potential orthologs in animals. The large number of components with known function in ubiquitylation indicates that this process plays a complex role in cellular physiology.
11712280	Congenital aneurysm (diverticulum) of the right atrium. Clinical manifestations and results of operative treatment.	A patient is described in whom a large congenital aneurysm or diverticulum of the right atrium caused repeated attacks of supraventricular arrhythmia and a strikingly reduced cardiac output. The aneurysm, which contained a large thrombus, was demonstrated by preoperative angiographic examinations. At the time of operation, regular rhythm returned at the moment the aneurysm was transsected. The patient is asymptomatic after operation, and has maintained sinus rhythm. A normal cardiac index was recorded at postoperative cardiac catheterization.
12389335	Insulin-like growth factor I polymorphism and breast cancer risk in Jewish women.	BACKGROUND: Genes that confer mild or moderate susceptibility to breast cancer may be involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic breast cancer, modifying the phenotypic expression of mutant BRCA1/BRCA2 alleles. An attractive candidate is the insulin-like growth factor I, a known mitogen to mammary ductal cells in vivo and in vitro, whose serum levels were reportedly elevated in breast cancer patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the contribution of the IGF-1 gene polymorphism to breast cancer risk by genotyping for a polymorphic allele size in breast cancer patients and controls. METHODS: We analyzed allele size distribution of the polymorphic CA repeat upstream of the IGF-I gene in 412 Israeli Jewish women: 268 women with breast cancer (212 sporadic and 56 carriers of either a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation), and 144 controls. Genotyping was accomplished by radioactive polymerase chain reaction of the relevant genomic region and size fractionation on polyacrylamide gels with subsequent autoradiography. RESULTS: Among women with breast cancer, with or without BRCA germline mutations, 196 and 198 basepair alleles were present in 4.7% (25/536 alleles), compared with 9% (26/288) controls (P = 0.02). This difference was more pronounced and significant in the non-Ashkenazi population. Conversely, the smaller size allele (176 bp) was present in the breast cancer group only (3/536, 0.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The IGF-I polymorphism may serve as a marker for breast cancer risk in the general Jewish population, in particular non-Ashkenazi Jews, but extension and confirmation of these preliminary data are needed.
12711064	Problems associated with product enhancement reverse transcriptase assay using bacteriophage MS2 RNA as a template.	In order to identify the reverse transcriptase activity in sera and conditioned media from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of large granular lymphocyte leukemia patients product enhanced reverse transcriptase activity (PERT) assays were performed using bacteriophage MS2 RNA as a template. All samples obtained from conditioned media of virus-infected cell lines as well as PBMCs of lymphocytic leukemia patients and normal healthy individuals tested positive with this assay. Therefore the validity of the assay was questioned. Careful evaluation of the assay revealed that some of the essential reagents used, such as Taq DNA polymerase and RNase inhibitor contained indigenous amplifiable DNA. DNase I treatment of Taq DNA polymerase before PCR reduced the product significantly. Moreover, no false positive results were observed when encephalomyocarditis virus RNA was used instead of MS2 RNA as the template. These results suggest a need for caution when using bacteriophage MS2 RNA as the template in PERT assays to confirm the presence of retroviral infection or for identification of novel retroviruses.
8668529	Identification of the structural and functional human homolog of the yeast ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBC9.	Ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (UBCs) are a family of proteins directly involved in ubiquitination of proteins. Ubiquitination is known to be involved in control of a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, through the targeting of key regulatory proteins for degradation. The ubc9 gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Scubc9) is an essential gene which is required for cell cycle progression and is involved in the degradation of S phase and M phase cyclins. We have identified a human homolog of Scubc9 (termed hubc9) using the two hybrid screen for proteins that interact with the human papillomavirus type 16 E1 replication protein. The hubc9 encoded protein shares a very high degree of amino acid sequence similarity with ScUBC9 and with the homologous hus5+ gene product of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Genetic complementation experiments in a S.cerevisiae ubc9ts mutant reveal that hUBC9 can substitute for the function of ScUBC9 required for cell cycle progression.
9538586	A reliability and validity study of the Women's Role Strain Inventory.	The purpose of this study was to theoretically conceptualize, develop and test the Women's Role Strain Inventory (WRSI) which assesses role strain in women who have multiple roles. There is limited research published related to role strain of women, although role strain, role conflict and role stress have been documented to have negative and positive effects (Hall 1975, Hall 1992). The theoretical basis for this study is based upon Goode's Theory of Role Strain (1960) and Sieber's Theory of Role Accumulation (1974). The pilot consisted of 62 female nurses, and the sample used for construct validity consisted of 445 female nurses. Content validity resulted in a content validity index of (.91). Exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation resulted in a three-factor solution supporting Goode's (1960) theory of role strain, and Sieber's (1974) theory of role accumulation. Alpha coefficients for the three subscales were .89 (role distress), .86 (role enhancement), and .81 (role support). Internal consistency of .93 was achieved for the overall WRSI. Test-retest coefficients ranged from .61 to .91. The high reliability and validity of the WRSI make it a reliable and valid instrument to measure role strain of women.
10075081	Cytokinetics of a novel 1,2,3-triazene-containing heterocycle, 8-nitro-3-methyl-benzo-1,2,3,5-tetrazepin-4(3H)-one (NIME), in the human epithelial ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-3.	The mechanism of action of the novel tetrazepinone 8-nitro-3-methyl-benzo-1,2,3,5-tetrazepin-4(3H)-one (NIME), structurally related to the antitumour drug temozolomide, was studied in the human ovarian tumour cell line OVCAR-3. NIME preferentially inhibited DNA synthesis over protein and RNA syntheses at 3 and 24 hr post-treatment. A Maxam-Gilbert sequencing assay showed that NIME induced barely detectable levels of guanine N7 alkylation in an isolated DNA strand, in contrast to temozolomide, a strong alkylating agent containing, like NIME, a cyclic 3-methyl-1,2,3-triazene moiety. Alkaline sucrose density-gradient sedimentation, at concentrations 2- to 10-fold lower than the ones used in the DNA sequencing assay, showed significant DNA damage in OVCAR-3 cells 24 hr after treatment with NIME. This was accompanied by a significant accumulation of cells in late S and G2M. Cell cycle arrest was transient and was reversed after 2-3 days following drug treatment. This was in agreement with bivariate bromodeoxyuridine/propidium iodide analysis, which showed that at 100 microM, a concentration at which the majority of the cells arrested in late S and G2M, a significant fraction of bromodeoxyuridine positive (S-phase) cells escaped the block. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism underlying these effects, the degradation of NIME in cell culture medium was analyzed by GC-MS (gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry). The results showed that, in contrast to temozolomide, NIME did not convert to an open-chain alkyltriazene in cell culture medium, but to a major benzimidazole product, which exerted a minor effect on the cell cycle. This suggests that NIME, despite containing a 3-(alkyl)-1,2,3-triazene moiety, does not act by DNA alkylation but probably by generating a short-lived genotoxic species during its degradation to 6,5-benzofused derivatives.
10758502	Repair of UV damage in plants by nucleotide excision repair: Arabidopsis UVH1 DNA repair gene is a homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad1.	To analyze plant mechanisms for resistance to UV radiation, mutants of Arabidopsis that are hypersensitive to UV radiation (designated uvh and uvr) have been isolated. UVR2 and UVR3 products were previously identified as photolyases that remove UV-induced pyrimidine dimers in the presence of visible light. Plants also remove dimers in the absence of light by an as yet unidentified dark repair mechanism and uvh1 mutants are defective in this mechanism. The UVH1 locus was mapped to chromosome 5 and the position of the UVH1 gene was further delineated by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of the uvh1-1 mutant with cosmids from this location. Cosmid NC23 complemented the UV hypersensitive phenotype and restored dimer removal in the uvh1-1 mutant. The cosmid encodes a protein similar to the S. cerevisiae RAD1 and human XPF products, components of an endonuclease that excises dimers by nucleotide excision repair (NER). The uvh1-1 mutation creates a G to A transition in intron 5 of this gene, resulting in a new 3' splice site and introducing an in-frame termination codon. These results provide evidence that the Arabidopsis UVH1/AtRAD1 product is a subunit of a repair endonuclease. The previous discovery in Lilium longiflorum of a homolog of human ERCC1 protein that comprises the second subunit of the repair endonuclease provides additional evidence for the existence of the repair endonuclease in plants. The UVH1 gene is strongly expressed in flower tissue and also in other tissues, suggesting that the repair endonuclease is widely utilized for repair of DNA damage in plant tissues.
10993646	Identification of somatic mutations of the MEN1 gene in sporadic endocrine tumours.	Endocrine tumours of the pancreas, anterior pituitary or parathyroids arise either sporadically in the general population, or as a part of inherited syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1). The mechanisms responsible for the development of sporadic endocrine lesions are not well understood, although loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the MEN1 locus on chromosome 11q13 and somatic mutation of the MEN1 gene have been frequently associated with the development of MEN 1-type sporadic endocrine lesions. To further investigate the role of the MEN1 gene in sporadic endocrine tumorigenesis, we analysed DNA from 14 primary parathyroid lesions, 8 anterior pituitary tumours and 3 pancreatic tumours for the presence of somatic MEN1 gene mutations and LOH of seven microsatellite markers flanking the MEN1 locus. In addition, we similarly analysed 8 secondary parathyroid lesions which arose in patients with chronic renal failure. None of the patients studied had a family history of MEN 1. Three primary parathyroid lesions and one pancreatic tumour (glucagonoma) were found to have lost one allele at the MEN1 locus. Somatic mutations were identified by SSCP and sequence analysis in one of these parathyroid lesions (P320L) and in the glucagonoma (E179V). These results support previous findings that inactivation of the MEN1 tumour suppressor gene contributes to the development of sporadic MEN 1-type endocrine lesions but is not associated with the development of parathyroid hyperplasia seen in some renal failure patients.
11729144	Dissection of the functions of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD6 postreplicative repair group in mutagenesis and UV sensitivity.	The RAD6 postreplicative repair group participates in various processes of DNA metabolism. To elucidate the contribution of RAD6 to starvation-associated mutagenesis, which occurs in nongrowing cells cultivated under selective conditions, we analyzed the phenotype of strains expressing various alleles of the RAD6 gene and single and multiple mutants of the RAD6, RAD5, RAD18, REV3, and MMS2 genes from the RAD6 repair group. Our results show that the RAD6 repair pathway is also active in starving cells and its contribution to starvation-associated mutagenesis is similar to that of spontaneous mutagenesis. Epistatic analysis based on both spontaneous and starvation-associated mutagenesis and UV sensitivity showed that the RAD6 repair group consists of distinct repair pathways of different relative importance requiring, besides the presence of Rad6, also either Rad18 or Rad5 or both. We postulate the existence of four pathways: (1) nonmutagenic Rad5/Rad6/Rad18, (2) mutagenic Rad5/Rad6 /Rev3, (3) mutagenic Rad6/Rad18/Rev3, and (4) Rad6/Rad18/Rad30. Furthermore, we show that the high mutation rate observed in rad6 mutants is caused by a mutator different from Rev3. From our data and data previously published, we suggest a role for Rad6 in DNA repair and mutagenesis and propose a model for the RAD6 postreplicative repair group.
12582027	Alcohol, folate, methionine, and risk of incident breast cancer in the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort.	Recent studies suggest that the increased risk of breast cancer associated with alcohol consumption may be reduced by adequate folate intake. We examined this question among 66,561 postmenopausal women in the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort. A total of 1,303 incident cases had accrued during the first 5 years of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models and stratified analysis were used to examine the relationship between alcohol, dietary and total folate intake, multivitamin use, dietary methionine, and breast cancer. We observed an increasing risk of breast cancer with increasing alcohol consumption (P for trend = 0.01). In the highest category of consumption (15 or more grams of ethanol/day), the risk of breast cancer was 1.26 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.53) compared with nonusers. We observed this association with higher alcohol consumption for in situ, localized, and regional disease. We found no association between risk of breast cancer and dietary folate, total folate, multivitamin use, or methionine intake. Furthermore, we found no evidence of an interaction between levels of dietary folate (P for interaction = 0.10) or total folate (P for interaction = 0.61) and alcohol. Nor did we find evidence of an interaction between alcohol consumption and recent or long-term multivitamin use (P for interaction = 0.27). Our results are consistent with a positive association with alcohol but do not support an association with folate or methionine intake or an interaction between folate and alcohol intake on risk of breast cancer.
7841968	Psychometric properties and responsiveness of the EORTC quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) in patients with breast, ovarian and lung cancer.	The QLQ-C30, a health-related quality of life questionnaire developed for use in patients with cancer, has been previously validated in patients with lung cancer and head and neck cancer. In this study, further validation was carried out for 535 patients, including patients with breast cancer (n = 143) and ovarian cancer (n = 111) for whom there is no previously published validation, as well as patients with lung cancer (n = 160) and a heterogeneous group of other cancers (n = 121). All patients were entered in one of two trials of anti-emetics to prevent chemotherapy-induced emesis. The QLQ-C30 was completed before chemotherapy and on day 8 after chemotherapy. The factor structure in patients with breast and ovarian cancer was similar to that previously described. Interdomain correlations, in the entire group, were strongest for the physical and role function domains and the fatigue, pain and global quality of life domains before and after chemotherapy. In addition, after chemotherapy, social function was also strongly correlated with fatigue and global quality of life. These correlations were not always of equal strength in the breast, ovarian and lung groups, suggesting that there may be differences between these groups. The responsiveness of the QLQ-C30 in the presence of widely metastatic, as compared with locoregional, disease showed changes in the expected directions (i.e., diminished function in physical and social role functions and in global quality of life, with greater fatigue and pain in patients with metastatic disease). Eight days after chemotherapy, decreases were seen in physical, role and social functioning and in global quality of life, and there was greater fatigue, nausea and vomiting compared with before chemotherapy. Patients with breast cancer had better physical, role and social functioning and less fatigue and pain than patients with ovarian cancer. This result is expected, since many of the patients with breast cancer had early stage disease, whereas those with ovarian cancer had advanced stage disease. Mean scores for patients with lung cancer were between the other two groups, in keeping with the mixture of early and advanced stage disease in these patients. There was a strong correlation between ECOG performance status scores and several domains of the QLQ-C30; these were all in the expected directions. The results of this study confirm those in earlier studies on patients with lung cancer, and provide new information on patients with breast and ovarian cancer. In addition, the QLQ-C30 is responsive to the effects of chemotherapy and of metastatic disease.
8268227	Polyamines modulate streptomycin-induced mistranslation in Escherichia coli.	The effects of intracellular levels of polyamines on both the in vivo inhibition of protein synthesis and the decrease of translation accuracy induced by streptomycin have been studied in polyamine-auxotrophic strains of Escherichia coli infected with the MS2 bacteriophage. The amount of viral coat protein formed was strongly reduced upon addition of increasing concentrations of streptomycin to polyamine-supplemented bacteria. In contrast, the antibiotic almost did not inhibit coat protein synthesis in polyamine-starved cells. The increase of mistranslation frequency elicited by streptomycin was only observed in bacteria grown with putrescine. In these cells several coat protein-satellites were detected after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. These proteins, more basic than the normal MS2 coat protein, contain multiple substitutions of lysine for asparagine.
9693041	Identification, expression, and chromosomal localization of ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 7 (UBE2G2), a human homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ubc7 gene.	Protein degradation is an essential mechanism for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, in which excess or aberrant proteins are eliminated from the cell. In eukaryotes, conjugation of target proteins to ubiquitin is an essential step in the proteasome-dependent degradation process and is mediated by a family of ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (UBC). Several of these have been identified in a variety of organisms. Here we report the identification of UBE2G2, a human homologue of the yeast Ubc7 gene. We describe a 2.9-kb cDNA sequence encoding a 165-amino-acid protein that shares significant similarity with other members of the UBC family. We have found UBE2G2 to be ubiquitously expressed, with high levels of expression seen in adult muscle, and have detected two transcripts of 2.9 and 7.0 kb in all tissues. In addition, we have mapped UBC7 to human chromosome 21q22.3 close to 21qtel.
9753690	The crystal structure of human cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase: a target for cancer chemotherapy.	BACKGROUND: Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) is a ubiquitous enzyme found in all prokaryotes and eukaryotes. As an enzyme of the thymidylate synthase metabolic cycle, SHMT catalyses the retro-aldol cleavage of serine to glycine, with the resulting hydroxymethyl group being transferred to tetrahydrofolate to form 5, 10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate. The latter is the major source of one-carbon units in metabolism. Elevated SHMT activity has been shown to be coupled to the increased demand for DNA synthesis in rapidly proliferating cells, particularly tumour cells. Consequently, the central role of SHMT in nucleotide biosynthesis makes it an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy. RESULTS: We have solved the crystal structure of human cytosolic SHMT by multiple isomorphous replacement to 2.65 A resolution. The monomer has a fold typical for alpha class pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzymes. The tetramer association is best described as a 'dimer of dimers' where residues from both subunits of one 'tight' dimer contribute to the active site. CONCLUSIONS: The crystal structure shows the evolutionary relationship between SHMT and other alpha class PLP-dependent enzymes, as the fold is highly conserved. Many of the results of site-directed mutagenesis studies can easily be rationalised or re-interpreted in light of the structure presented here. For example, His 151 is not the catalytic base, contrary to the findings of others. A mechanism for the cleavage of serine to glycine and formaldehyde is proposed.
9932817	Two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis of membranous protein from human thyroid tissues and cancer cell lines.	Thyroid neoplasm is the most commonly encountered neoplastic disorder in endocrine clinics. Thyroid scan, ultrasonography, and fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) are used as diagnostic tools to differentiate a malignant nodule from a benign lesion. There are certain limitations and pitfalls in FNAC, especially in the diagnosing of follicular tumors. The lack of characteristic findings or a specific tumor marker are the most common problems in the preoperative diagnosis of thyroid follicular carcinoma. Although serum thyroglobulin level has been used as a tumor marker for post-operative, well-differentiated thyroid cancer, the assay cannot be used for preoperative diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma. In this study, various thyroid tissues and cancer cell lines including CGTH W-1, CGTH W-3, RO 82 W-1, SW 579 cell lines were used for the investigation of tumor markers. Specific spots were identified in the area near the 60 kDa molecular mass protein and isoelectric point (pI) 5.9 of the CGTH W-1 cell line. These spots could not be found in the papillary or anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines. Another spot with a molecular weight of about 9.8 kDa with a low pI of 4.8 was present in the CGTH W-1 and RO 82 W-1 cell lines. This spot appeared to be a tumor marker of follicular cancer cells. This spot could not be found in the papillary and anaplastic cancer cell lines and other benign thyroid tissues. Specific proteins that were identified in this study may be useful as tumor markers for follicular thyroid carcinoma.
8538651	The HMG-domain protein Ixr1 blocks excision repair of cisplatin-DNA adducts in yeast.	Ixr1 is a yeast HMG-domain protein which binds the major DNA adducts of the antitumor drug cisplatin. Previous work demonstrated that Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking the IXR1 gene were two-fold less sensitive to cisplatin treatment than wild-type cells, and the present investigation reveals a six-fold difference in yeast having a different background. The possibility that the lower cytotoxicity of cisplatin in the ixr1 strain is the result of enhanced repair was investigated in rad1, rad2, rad4, rad6, rad9, rad10, rad14 and rad52 backgrounds. In three of the excision repair mutants, rad2, rad4 and rad14, the differential sensitivity caused by removing the Ixr1 protein was nearly abolished. This result demonstrates that the greater cisplatin resistance in the ixr1 strain is most likely a consequence of excision repair, supporting the theory that Ixr1 and other HMG-domain proteins can block repair of the major cisplatin-DNA adducts in vivo. The differential sensitivity of wild-type cells and those lacking Ixr1 persisted in the rad1 and rad10 strains, however, indicating that these two proteins act at a stage in the excision repair pathway where damage recognition is less critical. A model is proposed to account for these results, which is strongly supported recently identified functional roles for the rad excision repair gene products. A rad52 mutant was more sensitive to cisplatin than the RAD52 parental strain, which reveals that Rad52, a double-strand break repair protein, repairs cisplatin-DNA adducts, probably interstrand cross-links. A rad52 ixr1 strain was less sensitive to cisplatin than the rad52 IXR1 strain, consistent with Ixr1 not blocking repair of cisplatin adducts removed by Rad52 rad6 strains behaved similarly, except they were both substantially more sensitive to cisplatin. Interruption of the RAD9 gene, which is involved in DNA-damage-induced cell cycle arrest, had no affect on cisplatin cytotoxicity.
8629545	Current management of breast cancer.	Breast cancer accounts for more than 25 percent of all new cases of cancer in women. Family physicians have an important role in the management of patients who are diagnosed with breast cancer. The clinical staging system is a two-phase postsurgical process that assesses relevant prognostic factors and directs selection of adjuvant therapy after surgery. In stage I or II breast cancer, a patient's chances of disease recurrence and death depend on the number of cancer-positive regional lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis. Survival rates in patients with metastatic disease vary with the location and type of metastases. Whether surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy is chosen, patients and their families need continuous advice and support, especially when the cancer is advanced.
8678980	Organization and chromosomal localization of a B1-like containing repeat of Microtus subarvalis.	A repetitive DNA sequence, MS2, was isolated from EcoRI-digested genomic DNA of the vole, Microtus subarvalis. The fragment was cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis of this 1194-bp fragment revealed a 156-bp region demonstrating a 55% homology with the mouse B1 repeat. The remaining MS2 sequence shows no significant homology with other known GenBank sequences. The results of in situ hybridization of MS2 on vole metaphase chromosomes indicate the fragment is confined to heterochromatin blocks of the sex chromosomes in all but one species (M. arvalis). Distribution of MS2 sequences provides evidence for heterogeneity of the giant heterochromatin blocks of the XY Chromosomes (Chrs) in voles, for the unique cluster-like localization of MS2 within these blocks.
9664119	Prognostic value of tumor cell proliferation and intratumor microvessel density in advanced gastric cancer treated with curative surgery.	To clarify the prognostic value of tumor cell proliferation [proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive rate assessed by anti-PCNA immunostaining] and intratumor microvessel density (/0.74 mm2, assessed by anti-CD34 immunostaining) in gastric cancer, 192 advanced gastric cancer patients who underwent curative surgery were investigated. Multivariate analysis showed that the following variables were significantly related to prognosis: age (P=0.029), depth of invasion (P=0.005), lymph node metastasis (P=0.006), lymphatic invasion (P=0.038), venous invasion (P=0.0005), PCNA-positive rate (P=0.049) and intratumor microvessel density (P=0. 011). In conclusion, tumor cell proliferation and intratumor microvessel density were independent prognostic factors in patients with advanced gastric cancer undergoing curative surgery.
10510890	NAT2 gene polymorphism as a possible marker for susceptibility to bladder cancer in Japanese.	BACKGROUND: N-acetyltransferase (NAT) is known to metabolize the carcinogen arylamine. The polymorphism of the NAT2 gene is an important determinant of individual susceptibility to bladder cancer. There are significant interethnic differences in NAT2 allele frequencies. The relationship between NAT2 genotypes and bladder cancer in a Japanese population was investigated. METHODS: A case control study on 85 bladder cancer patients and 146 control subjects was conducted. NAT2 alleles were differentiated by polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods using originally created PCR primers and genomic DNA extracted from peripheral white blood cells. The NAT2 genotypes were determined by the combination of three known NAT2 mutant type alleles (M1, M2, M3) and the wild type allele. RESULTS: NAT2 slow genotypes were associated with bladder cancer risk (odds ratio adjusted for age and gender, 4.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.76-10.81). Among those with NAT2 slow genotypes/smoker, there was a significantly increased risk of 7.80 (95% CI, 1.66-57.87) when the NAT2 rapid genotypes/non-smoker were considered the reference group. This suggested a possible interaction between NAT2 slow genotypes/smoking status and bladder cancer risk. It was also shown that bladder cancer patients with NAT2 slow genotypes were more likely to have a high grade tumor (G3) or an advanced stage tumor (pT2-pT4) [corrected]. However, no association between NAT2 genotypes and the survival rate of invasive bladder cancer patients was recognized. CONCLUSION: It was demonstrated that the NAT2 slow acetylation genotype is an important genetic determinant for bladder cancer in a Japanese population.
11057907	Activation of the IkappaB kinase complex by TRAF6 requires a dimeric ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex and a unique polyubiquitin chain.	TRAF6 is a signal transducer in the NF-kappaB pathway that activates IkappaB kinase (IKK) in response to proinflammatory cytokines. We have purified a heterodimeric protein complex that links TRAF6 to IKK activation. Peptide mass fingerprinting analysis reveals that this complex is composed of the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Ubc13 and the Ubc-like protein Uev1A. We find that TRAF6, a RING domain protein, functions together with Ubc13/Uev1A to catalyze the synthesis of unique polyubiquitin chains linked through lysine-63 (K63) of ubiquitin. Blockade of this polyubiquitin chain synthesis, but not inhibition of the proteasome, prevents the activation of IKK by TRAF6. These results unveil a new regulatory function for ubiquitin, in which IKK is activated through the assembly of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains.
11712295	Disturbances in atrial rhythm and conduction following the surgical creation of an atrial septal defect by the Blalock-Hanlon technique.	Disturbances in atrial conduction or rhythm, or both, were found in 16 of 27 patients undergoing the surgical creation of an atrial septal defect by the Blalock-Hanlon technique. These included P-wave aberrations of intra-atrial block and ectopic atrial rhythm, A-V rhythm, A-V dissociation, sinus bradycardia, atrial flutter, escape-capture bigeminy, and atrial premature beats. Some of these were transient and occurred within 2 weeks after surgery. It seems likely that tissue trauma engendered by the clamp and resection of the atrial septum with possible injury to the internodal conducting pathways may be the genesis of these early postoperative disturbances. Of the eight cases with transient disturbances, six occurred in this period. Later changes, such as intra-atrial block, sinus bradycardia, and atrial flutter, may be attributed to changes in atrial size secondary to the postoperative pathophysiology. Digitalis intoxication and congestive heart failure cannot be excluded as contributory factors in either the early or the late disturbances. It was not possible to correlate the incidence and nature of these disturbances with morbidity and mortality. In such severely ill, cyanotic infants, irregularities, however slight, may have altered cardiac function significantly and contributed to their deaths.
7508947	Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding protein-2 are increased in cyst fluids of epithelial ovarian cancer.	Expression of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), its receptor, and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) by epithelial ovarian cancer cells and its mitogenic effect on these cells in vitro suggest that IGF-I may have a role in the regulation of human ovarian cancer. To examine this role in vivo, we explored the IGF-I/IGFBP system in sera and cyst fluids of women undergoing surgery for simple and other benign cysts (n = 20) and borderline (n = 5) and invasive malignant epithelial neoplasms (n = 11). The IGF-I level was significantly higher in cyst fluid from invasive malignant compared to cyst fluid in benign neoplasms (16.1 +/- 2.2 vs. 7.3 +/- 1.2 nmol/L; P = 0.002). Although benign cysts contained almost no IGFBP, high IGFBP-2 levels were detected in malignant cysts regardless of histological type. Serum IGFBP-2 levels were also higher in women with invasive malignancy than in benign controls (1.32 +/- 0.32 vs. 0.53 +/- 0.07 relative units; P = 0.004). IGFBP-2 was higher in cyst fluids than in the corresponding sera, implying local production of this protein. Estradiol was high in fluid from invasive malignant cysts of postmenopausal women and correlated with IGF-I in the cyst fluid. Levels of IGF-I, IGFBP-2, and estradiol in cyst fluid could discriminate between benign and malignant neoplasms, except for the endometrioid-type tumors (n = 2). Our data support a role for IGF-I in the proliferation of ovarian cancer and suggest that IGF-I and estradiol interact in regulating this malignancy.
9583800	Influence of tumour necrosis factor microsatellite polymorphisms on susceptibility to head and neck cancer.	While cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption are recognized covariates for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the role of genetic factors in determining individual susceptibility is unknown. The human tumour necrosis factor (TNF) region on chromosome 6p21 within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) includes a number of immunologically important genes. Recently, five microsatellite markers have been described in the TNF locus. TNF levels vary with different TNF microsatellite alleles, and associations of these microsatellite markers with autoimmune diseases and different types of cancer have been shown. Therefore, the TNF locus represents candidate susceptibility genes for head and neck cancer. This study describes the influence of TNF a-d microsatellite polymorphisms on susceptibility to head and neck cancer by comparing the allele frequencies of 269 patients suffering from laryngeal cancer and 123 patients suffering from oral cavity pharyngeal cancer and 113 German controls. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples, amplified by polymerase chain reaction with fluorescently labelled primers for TNF microsatellite (a-d) and electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels using an automated DNA sequencer. The data showed no differences in allele frequencies between controls and pharyngeal cancer patients. By contrast, the TNF b3 allele was associated with altered risk for laryngeal cancer (p = 0.0006, odds ratio 2.2). Homozygosity for TNF b3/b3 resulted in an increased risk of developing laryngeal cancer (p = 0.004, odds ratio 5.3). Susceptibility to supraglottic SCC and multiple primary tumours was mediated by the absence of the a11 allele. The data provide the first evidence that allelism at the TNF microsatellite markers alter the risk of developing SCC of the larynx.
9614442	Identification and characterization of families with aggregation of lung cancer.	BACKGROUND: To clarify genetic factors involved in the susceptibility to lung cancer, it is essential to identify families with lung cancer clustering and to characterize the mode of clustering. Since somatic mutations of the p53, RB and p16 genes occur frequently in lung cancer and the replication error phenotype is seen in a subset of lung cancer, it is possible that germ-line mutations of the p53, RB, p16 and mismatch repair genes influence the susceptibility to lung cancer. METHODS: In this work, cases with familial clustering of lung cancer were selected from 1068 families with primary lung cancer cases in analogy with the criteria for hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Cases with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, familial retinoblastoma, familial melanoma and HNPCC were also searched among these 1068 families. RESULTS: There were only four families (0.4%) in which more than three relatives were affected by lung cancer. Two successive generations were affected in 36 families (3.4%). Patients with lung cancer before the age of 50 were present in 165 families (15.5%). However, no family conformed to all three criteria. There was only one family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome and no family with familial retinoblastoma, familial melanoma and HNPCC. CONCLUSION: Familial aggregation of lung cancer is rare and germ-line mutations of the p53, RB, p16 and mismatch repair genes may not contribute greatly to susceptibility to lung cancer.
11712288	Correlation of vectorcardiogram and electrocardiogram with coronary arteriogram.	One hundred patients with suspected coronary heart disease were studied by vectorcardiography (VCG), electrocardiography (ECG), and coronary arteriography. Twenty-eight patients had VCG evidence of anterior infarction; 26 of this group had severe narrowing or obstruction of the left anterior descending branch. Five did not have anterior infarction by ECG. Twenty-seven patients had VCG evidence of diaphragmatic infarction; 25 of this group had severe narrowing of the right coronary artery or the left circumflex branch or both. Six of the 27 did not have ECG evidence of diaphragmatic infarction. Twelve patients had VCG evidence of posterior infarction whereas it was detected by ECG in only two. Only six of the 12, however, had severe narrowing of the nutrient arteries to the posterobasal part of the myocardium. Thirteen patients with infarction had severe narrowing but not total obstruction of a coronary artery. On the other hand, 15 patients had total obstruction of a major coronary vessel without actual infarction.
12226657	RAD6-dependent DNA repair is linked to modification of PCNA by ubiquitin and SUMO.	The RAD6 pathway is central to post-replicative DNA repair in eukaryotic cells; however, the machinery and its regulation remain poorly understood. Two principal elements of this pathway are the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes RAD6 and the MMS2-UBC13 heterodimer, which are recruited to chromatin by the RING-finger proteins RAD18 and RAD5, respectively. Here we show that UBC9, a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-conjugating enzyme, is also affiliated with this pathway and that proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) -- a DNA-polymerase sliding clamp involved in DNA synthesis and repair -- is a substrate. PCNA is mono-ubiquitinated through RAD6 and RAD18, modified by lysine-63-linked multi-ubiquitination--which additionally requires MMS2, UBC13 and RAD5--and is conjugated to SUMO by UBC9. All three modifications affect the same lysine residue of PCNA, suggesting that they label PCNA for alternative functions. We demonstrate that these modifications differentially affect resistance to DNA damage, and that damage-induced PCNA ubiquitination is elementary for DNA repair and occurs at the same conserved residue in yeast and humans.
9234711	Domains required for dimerization of yeast Rad6 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and Rad18 DNA binding protein.	The RAD6 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme required for postreplicational repair of UV-damaged DNA and for damage-induced mutagenesis. In addition, Rad6 functions in the N end rule pathway of protein degradation. Rad6 mediates its DNA repair role via its association with Rad18, whose DNA binding activity may target the Rad6-Rad18 complex to damaged sites in DNA. In its role in N end-dependent protein degradation, Rad6 interacts with the UBR1-encoded ubiquitin protein ligase (E3) enzyme. Previous studies have indicated the involvement of N-terminal and C-terminal regions of Rad6 in interactions with Ubr1. Here, we identify the regions of Rad6 and Rad18 that are involved in the dimerization of these two proteins. We show that a region of 40 amino acids towards the C terminus of Rad18 (residues 371 to 410) is sufficient for interaction with Rad6. This region of Rad18 contains a number of nonpolar residues that have been conserved in helix-loop-helix motifs of other proteins. Our studies indicate the requirement for residues 141 to 149 at the C terminus, and suggest the involvement of residues 10 to 22 at the N terminus of Rad6, in the interaction with Rad18. Each of these regions of Rad6 is indicated to form an amphipathic helix.
9815849	Androgen receptor variants with short glutamine or glycine repeats may identify unique subpopulations of men with prostate cancer.	The androgen receptor (AR) contains glutamine (CAG) and glycine (GGC) repeats that are each polymorphic in length. We screened clinically localized prostate cancers for somatic mutations in the length of the CAG and GGC repeats in the AR gene and characterized the length of these repeats in the germ-line AR gene. Somatic mutations were rare, and the range of germ-line repeat lengths in men with prostate cancer was within the range of normal in the general population. Most allele frequencies in Caucasian men with clinical prostate cancer were remarkably comparable to those in the general Caucasian population. However, a subpopulation of the men with clinical prostate cancer had a substantially higher frequency of AR alleles with 16 or 17 CAGs (6 of 59 men, 10%) than did the general population (6 of 370 alleles, 1.6%), and a different subpopulation of the men with prostate cancer had a higher frequency of AR alleles with 12 or 13 GGCs (7 of 54 men, 13%) than did the general population (1 of 110 alleles, 0.9%). Of the men with prostate cancer who had an AR gene with 16 or 17 CAGs, 83% had lymph node-positive disease, despite the lack of clinical evidence of metastatic spread. This suggests that a short AR CAG allele may be a risk factor for the development of clinically unsuspected lymph node-positive prostate cancer among men undergoing radical prostatectomy and raises the question of whether this short repeat length played an active role in the development of aggressive prostate cancer. The odds of having a germ-line AR gene with a short CAG repeat (</=17 CAGs) were substantially higher in Caucasian men with lymph node-positive prostate cancer than in Caucasian men with lymph node-negative disease or in the general Caucasian population. The odds of having a short germ-line AR CAG were the same for men with lymph node-negative prostate cancer as for the general Caucasian population. The odds of having a germ-line AR gene with a short glycine repeat (</=14 GGCs) were substantially higher in men with prostate cancer than in the general population, but the frequency of alleles with a short GGC repeat was the same in men with lymph node-positive versus lymph node-negative disease. This suggests that a short GGC repeat may be a risk factor for the development of clinical prostate cancer, a hypothesis that needs to be tested in cohort and case-control studies.
10506649	Expression and immunogenicity of a liver stage malaria epitope presented as a foreign peptide on the surface of RNA-free MS2 bacteriophage capsids.	We have designed a novel vaccine strategy which enables display of short peptides expressed from chimeras of the gene encoding the coat protein of the RNA bacteriophage MS2 and inserted foreign DNA. MS2 coat protein has a beta-hairpin loop at the N-terminus which forms the most radially distinct feature of the mature capsid. The coat protein gene was modified to enable insertion of DNA at the central part of the beta-hairpin loop. Upon expression of the recombinant gene in E. coli, the MS2 coat protein subunits self-assemble into capsids, each comprising 180 copies of the monomer. This system was used to produce chimeras containing a putatively protective epitope, T1, from the immunodominant liver stage antigen-1 (LSA-1) of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The immunogenicity of the native MS2 capsid and the recombinant construct was investigated in BALB/c (H-2(d)) mice. The native protein appeared to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses, observed as a predominance of type 2 cytokines but with a mixed profile of immunoglobulin isotypes. In contrast, the LSA-1 chimera stimulated a type 1-polarised response, with significant upregulation of interferon-gamma, a finding which corroborates naturally acquired resistance to liver stage malaria. These results validate RNA phage capsid display of immunogenic determinants as a basis for the development of novel peptide vaccines and indicate that further evaluation of MS2 coat protein as a vector for malaria epitopes is merited.
11918717	MICA gene polymorphism is not associated with an increased risk for skin cancer.	The MICA gene encodes for major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related proteins (MIC), which belong to a recently identified new family of nonclassical major histocompatibility complex molecules. The general structure of the MICA molecule resembles that of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. MIC molecules are considered to be stress-induced antigens that are recognized by cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells, which play an important role in the surveillance of transformed infected and damaged cells. Associations of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules with skin cancer have been described before. To evaluate the possible association of MICA gene polymorphism with the risk for nonmelanoma skin cancer we evaluated 153 cases with squamous cell carcinoma, 261 cases with basal cell carcinoma, 111 controls with malignant melanoma, and 247 controls without a history of skin cancer. Five distinct MICA alleles A4, A5, A6, A9, and A5.1 were studied. As the MICA 5.1 variant gene contains a four-nucleotide insertion that causes a stop codon in the trans membrane region, the resulting truncated MICA molecule does not reside on the cellular membrane. In the case of individuals who are homozygous for MICA 5.1 this results in cells that are naked for the MICA molecule. We therefore specifically addressed the possible association between MICA 5.1 homozygosity and skin cancer, as these individuals are expected to be at the highest risk for skin cancer if the MICA gene plays a role in skin carcinogenesis. Viral proteins may serve as antigens for recognition of skin cancer by the immune system. Human papillomavirus is the most likely candidate virus to be involved in the carcinogenesis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Hence, we also assessed the association between MICA polymorphism and squamous cell carcinoma in human-papillomavirus-positive and human-papillomavirus-negative individuals as identified by the presence of human papillomavirus DNA in hairs plucked from their eyebrows. Our analyses did not reveal any significant differences regarding the MICA allele frequencies between cases and controls. Also homozygotes and heterozygotes for the MICA 5.1 variant gene were not at an increased risk for skin cancer compared to individuals without this variant gene and infection with human papillomavirus did not materially influence these findings. The same group of cases and controls was large enough to show an association between melanocortin 1 receptor gene polymorphism and skin cancer and to reasonably exclude an association between p53 codon 72 polymorphism and skin cancer. Therefore, we conclude that an association between MICA gene polymorphism and nonmelanoma skin cancer is not likely.
12644539	Effects of blocking platelet-derived growth factor-receptor signaling in a mouse model of experimental prostate cancer bone metastases.	BACKGROUND: Expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and activation (by autophosphorylation) of its receptor (PDGF-R), a tyrosine kinase, are associated with the growth of metastatic prostate tumor cells in the bone parenchyma. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 blocks the PDGF signaling pathway by inhibiting PDGF-R autophosphorylation. We examined the effects of STI571, given alone or with paclitaxel (Taxol), on tumor growth in a mouse model of prostate cancer metastasis. METHODS: Human prostate cancer PC-3MM2 cells were injected into the tibias of male nude mice. Three days later the mice (20 per group) were randomly assigned to 5 weeks of treatment with oral and injected water (control), daily oral STI571, weekly injected paclitaxel, or STI571 plus paclitaxel. Lesions in bone and the surrounding muscles were then harvested and analyzed by histology, western blotting (for PDGF-R phosphorylation), immunohistochemistry (for expression of proangiogenic molecules), and double immunofluorescence (to identify endothelial cells and apoptotic tumor cells). Growth of bone lesions was monitored by digital radiography. Bone lesions from control mice were used to establish short-term cell cultures for analysis of PDGF-R phosphorylation. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: PC-3MM2 cells cultured from bone lesions and treated in vitro with STI571 had less phosphorylated PDGF-R than untreated cells. In control mice, bone lesions expressed high levels of PDGF and activated (i.e., phosphorylated) PDGF-R, whereas lesions in the adjacent musculature did not. Activated PDGF-R was present on the surface of endothelial cells within the bone lesions but not in endothelial cells of uninjected bone. Mice treated with STI571 or STI571 plus paclitaxel had a lower tumor incidence, smaller tumors, and less bone lysis and lymph node metastasis than mice treated with water or paclitaxel alone (P<.001 for all). Mice treated with STI571 or STI571 plus paclitaxel had less phosphorylated PDGF-R on tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells, less tumor cell proliferation, statistically significantly more apoptotic tumor cells (all P<.001), and fewer tumor-associated endothelial cells (P<.001) than control mice. CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial cells appear to express phosphorylated PDGF-R when they are exposed to tumor cells that express PDGF. Using STI571 to inhibit PDGF-R phosphorylation may, especially in combination with paclitaxel, produce substantial therapeutic effects against prostate cancer bone metastasis.
7624149	Frequent deletion of chromosome 19 and a rare rearrangement of 19p13.3 involving the insulin receptor gene in human ovarian cancer.	Human ovarian cancer cells usually have multiple specific chromosomal deletions which can be detected by cytogenetic analysis or molecular techniques. Tumour suppressor genes might be located in these deleted chromosomal segments. The importance of these different loci is usually estimated from the frequency with which they are deleted. Here we report a 59% loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 19 in the DNA of human invasive epithelial ovarian cancer from a series of 37 patients. In all cases informative on both chromosomal arms a subchromosomal loss is observed. Analysis of the same tumours for chromosome 17p and 11p loss suggests that loss of chromosome 19p/q is less important than 17p loss, but more important than 11p loss. The deletion of chromosome 19q seems to be associated with distant, hematogeneous metastasis (stage IV). In two patients with high grade tumours, the deletion involves a rearrangement of the insulin receptor locus (19p13.3). This suggests that some of the previously described frequent cytogenetic 19p+ markers and 19p13.3 breaks observed in high grade ovarian cancers, might actually occur in the insulin receptor gene.
8286193	Analysis of the IGF-II receptor gene copy number in breast carcinoma.	Insulin and the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) may be important regulators of breast cancer growth. The IGF-II receptor is identical to the mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) receptor, which is involved in lysosomal enzyme pathways. In order to determine whether the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor gene copy number is altered in breast cancer we analysed specimens of invasive breast carcinoma from 51 patients by Southern blotting. No amplification of the receptor gene was observed whatever the clinical presentation of the tumour and irrespective of a concomitant amplification of c-erbB2 or int-2 genes in several tumours. As indicated by Northern blotting, the gene is transcribed in breast tumour tissues and non-tumour breast tissue. These results suggest that the receptor gene is stable in breast carcinoma and that, if anything, the receptor involvement in breast cancer progression may be the result of a disregulation of its expression at a post-transcriptional or post-translational level.
8607861	Increased expression of insulin receptor substrate-1 in human pancreatic cancer.	Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is a multisite docking protein implicated in mitogenic signaling following activation of the insulin and insulin-like growth factor I receptors. In the present study we characterized IRS-1 expression in human pancreatic cancer. Northern blot analysis revealed high levels of IRS-1 mRNA transcripts in ASPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cell lines, and lower levels in COLO-357, PANC-1, and T3M4 cells. Immunoblotting with anti-IRS-1 antibodies indicated that IRS-1 protein levels paralleled IRS-1 mRNA levels. Analysis of RNA isolated from normal and cancerous human pancreatic tissues indicated that 7 of 16 pancreatic cancer samples overexpressed IRS-1 mRNA transcripts by comparison with the normal pancreas and that insulin mRNA levels were abundant in many tumors. These data suggest that IRS-1 contributes to the signaling pathways that lead to excessive growth stimulation in human pancreatic cancer.
9394418	Insulin receptor expression and clinical outcome in node-negative breast cancer.	The insulin receptor (IR), a ligand-activated tyrosine kinase, is present in breast cancers, but its relationship to patient survival is unknown. The IR was measured in 584 tumor specimens from patients with node-negative breast carcinoma by frozen-section immunohistochemistry and light microscopy. The immunostaining signal was quantitated in relation to both the staining intensity and the proportion of positive malignant epithelial cells. Analyses indicated that patients with tumors with undetectable IR content in malignant epithelial cells (260 cases) had a relatively lower predicted 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) (69% +/- 3%) than did patients with tumors with detectable IR content (324 cases; DFS 76% +/- 3%, p = .032). The significance of IR content in these breast malignant epithelial cells was then analyzed along with patient age, tumor size, progesterone and estrogen receptor status, p53 accumulation, and S-phase. Multivariate analysis of these data revealed that after adjustment for these other variables, IR content was the strongest independent predictive factor for DFS (relative risk = 1.73, p = .005). Interestingly, in a small subset of patients with very high IR content (n = 62), DFS was decreased. These data indicate that IR content in node-negative breast cancers is a significant major predictor of reduced DFS. Moreover, they raise the possibility that the measurement of IR content might provide important information concerning breast cancer biology.
9516080	Type I insulin-like growth factor receptor function in breast cancer.	Experimental evidence suggests an important role of the type I IGF receptor (IGF-IR) in breast cancer development. Breast tumors and breast cancer cell lines express the IGF-IR. IGF-IR levels are higher in cancer cells than in normal breast tissue or in benign mammary tumors. The ligands of the IGF-IR are potent mitogens promoting monolayer and anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells. Interference with IGF-IR activation, expression, or signaling inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells. In addition, recent studies established the involvement of the IGF-IR in the regulation of breast cancer cell motility and adhesion. We have demonstrated that in MCF-7 cells, overexpression of the IGF-IR promotes E-cadherin-dependent cell aggregation, which is associated with enhanced cell proliferation and prolonged survival in three-dimensional culture. The expression or function of the IGF-IR in breast cancer cells is modulated by different humoral factors, such as estrogen, progesterone, IGF-II, and interleukin-1. The IGF-IR and the estrogen receptor (ER) are usually co-expressed and the two signaling systems are engaged in a complex functional cross-talk controlling cell proliferation. Despite the convincing experimental evidence, the role of the IGF-IR in breast cancer etiology, especially in metastatic progression, is still not clear. The view emerging from cellular and animal studies is that abnormally high levels of IGF-IRs may contribute to the increase of tumor mass and/or aid tumor recurrence, by promoting proliferation, cell survival, and cell-cell interactions. However, in breast cancer, except for the well established correlation with ER status, the associations of the IGF-IR with other prognostic parameters are still insufficiently documented.
9518262	Overexpression of membrane glycoprotein PC-1 can influence insulin action at a post-receptor site.	An elevated content of membrane glycoprotein PC-1 has been observed in cells and tissues of insulin resistant patients. In addition, in vitro overexpression of PC-1 in cultured cells induces insulin resistance associated with diminished insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity. We now find that PC-1 overexpression also influences insulin receptor signaling at a step downstream of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, independent of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. In the present studies, we employed Chinese hamster ovary cells that overexpress the human insulin receptor (CHO IR cells; approximately 10(6) receptors per cell), and transfected them with human PC-1 c-DNA (CHO IR PC-1). In CHO IR PC-1 cells, insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity was unchanged, following insulin treatment of cells. However, several biological effects of insulin, including glucose and amino acid uptake, were decreased. In CHO IR PC-1 cells, insulin stimulation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity was normal, suggesting that PC-1 overexpression did not affect insulin receptor activation of Ras, which is upstream of MAP kinase. Also, insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3-kinase activity was normal, suggesting that PC-1 overexpression did not interfere with the activation of this enzyme by insulin receptor substrate-1. In these cells, however, insulin stimulation of p70 ribosomal S6 kinase activity was diminished. These studies suggest, therefore, that, in addition to blocking insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activation, PC-1 can also block insulin receptor signaling at a post-receptor site.
9683787	Expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA in human gastric cancer.	Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) stimulates cell proliferation and development in normal human growth. In several human cancers, the IGF2 gene is overexpressed and is thus considered to be a growth factor for tumors mediated through both the paracrine and autocrine pathways. However, the significance of IGF2 mRNA expression in gastric cancer has yet to be clarified. We semi-quantitatively measured the expression of IGF2 mRNA in 57 Japanese cases of gastric cancer by means of the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and also analyzed the relation between the IGF2 expression status and other clinicopathologic factors. We also performed immunohistochemical staining for IGF2. In 41 of 57 cases (72%), the expression of IGF2 mRNA was greater in tumor tissue (T) than in normal tissue (N). The average tumor/normal (T/N) expression ratio of IGF2 mRNA corrected for that of control gene mRNA was 1.42, while ranging from 0.36 to 3.65. The T/N ratio of infiltrative-type cancers was greater than that of expanding-type cancers (p<0.05). The cases with lymphatic permeation showed a greater T/N ratio than those without lymphatic permeation in expanding-type cancers (p<0. 05). Immunohistochemical staining revealed IGF2 to be detected in cancer cells themselves, especially at the margin of the cancer tissue. The IGF2 gene may thus play an important role in lymph vessel permeation especially in expanding-type gastric cancers.
9860968	Cytologically normal cells from neoplastic cervical samples display extensive structural abnormalities on IR spectroscopy: implications for tumor biology.	Fourier-transform IR (FT-IR) spectra of pelleted exfoliated cervical cells from patients with cervical cancer or dysplasia differ from those from normal women. To study the origin of these spectral changes, we obtained the FT-IR spectra of individual cervical cells from normal, dysplastic, and malignant cervical samples. Ninety five percent of normal superficial and intermediate cells displayed two distinct spectral patterns designated A and B, and 5% displayed an intermediate pattern, suggesting extensive structural heterogeneity among these cells. Parabasal and endocervical cells showed pattern B spectra. The spectra of malignant, dysplastic, and other abnormal cells also were characterized. Analysis of FT-IR spectra of over 2, 000 individual cells from 10 normal females, 7 females with dysplasia, and 5 females with squamous cell carcinoma revealed that the spectra of normal-appearing intermediate and superficial cells of the cervix from women with either dysplasia or cancer differed from those of normal women. Chemometric and classical spectroscopic analysis showed a continuum of changes paralleling the transition from normalcy to malignancy. These findings suggest that (i) the structural changes underlying the spectroscopic changes are involved in or are a product of cervical carcinogenesis and (ii) the neoplastic process may be more extensive than currently recognized with morphological criteria. This approach may be useful for the structural study of neoplasia and also may be of help in the diagnosis or classification of cervical disorders.
10427145	Inhibition of insulin-like growth factor I receptor signaling by the vitamin D analogue EB1089 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells: A role for insulin-like growth factor binding proteins.	Insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II) are potent mitogens involved in growth regulation of breast epithelial cells and are implicated in the pathophysiology of breast cancer. Their bioactivity is enhanced or inhibited by specific IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). Vitamin D-related compounds (VDRCs) have been shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. We have previously demonstrated that VDRCs antagonize the growth-promoting activity of IGF-I by stimulating autocrine production of IGFBP-5 in MCF-7 cells, but the effect of VDRCs on IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) intracellular signaling has not been elucidated. We report here that the vitamin D analogue EB1089 interferes with the IGF-IR signaling pathway by attenuating IGF-I-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and to a lesser extent, IRS-2. It does not affect protein levels of IRS-1, IRS-2 or IGF-IR. However, EB1089 does not inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 induced by des(1-3) IGF-I, an IGF-I analogue with greatly reduced affinity for IGFBPs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an antisense IGFBP-5 oligodeoxynucleotide attenuates EB1089-induced inhibition of IGF-I-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and EB1089-induced IGFBP-5 accumulation. These data strongly suggest that IGFBP-5 plays a functional role in the interfering action of EB1089 with the IGF-IR signal transduction pathway.
10430101	Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor overexpression in breast cancers leads to insulin/IGF-I hybrid receptor overexpression: evidence for a second mechanism of IGF-I signaling.	The insulin receptor (IR) form hybrids with the closely related insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor (IGF-I-R). Because most human breast carcinomas overexpress both the IR and the IGF-I-R, we evaluated whether the insulin/IGF-I hybrid receptor (Hybrid-R) is also overexpressed in these tumors and what role it plays in breast cancer biology. Using specific ELISAs and Western blots, we measured Hybrid-R content and function in 8 human cultured breast cancer cell lines and 39 human breast cancer specimens. Hybrid-R content and function were also compared to the content and function of the IR and the IGF-I-R. Hybrid-R content exceeded the IGF-I-R content in >75% of breast cancer specimens and was directly related to the molar ratio of both the IR and IGF-I-R content, suggesting that Hybrid-R formation occurred by random assembly of IR and IGF-I-R half-receptors. Hybrid-Rs became tyrosine autophosphorylated when breast cancer cells were exposed to IGF-I but not when they were exposed to insulin. In cells with an elevated Hybrid-R content, Hybrid-R autophosphorylation in response to IGF-I exceeded IGF-I-R autophosphorylation, suggesting that most of the IGF-I effect occurred via the Hybrid-R. Furthermore, Hybrid-Rs mediated growth in response to IGF-I, as indicated by experiments with blocking antibodies to the IGF-I-R. These data indicated therefore that: (a) Hybrid-Rs are present and play a major role in mediating the IGF-I signal in breast cancer; (b) their expression is directly related to IR overexpression; and (c) potential therapies designed to block IGF-I actions in breast cancer must take into account the role of these Hybrid-Rs.
10669726	Insulin-like growth factor I-induced degradation of insulin receptor substrate 1 is mediated by the 26S proteasome and blocked by phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase inhibition.	Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) is a critical adapter protein involved in both insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling. Due to the fact that alteration of IRS-1 levels can affect the sensitivity and response to both insulin and IGF-I, we examined the ability of each of these ligands to affect IRS-1 expression. IGF-I (10 nM) stimulation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells caused a transient tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 that was maximal at 15 min and decreased thereafter. The decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was paralleled by an apparent decrease in IRS-1 levels. The IGF-mediated decrease in IRS-1 expression was posttranscriptional and due to a decrease in the half-life of the IRS-1 protein. Insulin (10 nM) caused tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 but not degradation, whereas high concentrations of insulin (10 microM) resulted in degradation of IRS-1. IGF-I (10 nM) stimulation resulted in transient IRS-1 phosphorylation and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) activation. In contrast, insulin (10 nM) caused sustained IRS-1 phosphorylation and ERK activation. Inhibition of 26S proteasome activity by the use of lactacystin or MG132 completely blocked IGF-mediated degradation of IRS-1. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed an association between ubiquitin and IRS-1 that was increased by treatment of cells with IGF-I. Finally, IGF-mediated degradation of IRS-1 was blocked by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase activity but was not affected by inhibition of ERK, suggesting that this may represent a direct negative-feedback mechanism resulting from downstream IRS-1 signaling. We conclude that IGF-I can cause ligand-mediated degradation of IRS-1 via the ubiquitin-mediated 26S proteasome and a phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase-dependent mechanism and that control of degradation may have profound effects on downstream activation of signaling pathways.
10791771	Mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor, a bona fide tumor suppressor gene or just a promising candidate?	"The mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (M6P/IGF2R) is considered a ""candidate"" tumor suppressor gene. This hypothesis has been provoked by the identification of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the M6P/IGF2R locus on chromosome 6q26 in breast and liver cancer, accompanied by point mutations in the remaining allele. Somatic mutations in coding region microsatellites have also been described in replication error positive (RER+) tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, endometrium and brain. These genetic data are compelling, but a tumor suppressor gene candidate has to meet functional as well as genetic criteria. This review weighs the evidence and discusses the observations that are necessary to promote M6P/IGF2R from candidate to bona fide tumor suppressor gene."
11828267	[Expression and prognostic significance in epithelial ovarian cancer].	BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) is a glycoprotein with specific binding affinity to peptide hormones insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) which are potent mitogens for a variety of cells. IGFBP-3 can inhibit the activities of IGFs by interfering with the interaction between IGFs and their receptor IGF-IR. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) tissues express IGFBP-3, IGFs and IGF-IR. Moreover, high levels of IGF-I and IGF-IR have been shown in epithelial ovarian cancer, and IGF-I stimulates the growth of ovarian cancer. METHODS: We measured IGFBP-3 levels in ovarian cancer tissues of 147 consecutive patients and we examined its association with clinical and pathological features of the disease and patient survival. The average age of the patients in the study was 55 years and the median follow-up time was 37 months. IGFBP-3 levels were measured in the tissue extracts by a commercial ELISA kit and non-parametric statistics and the Cox regression survival analysis were used to determine the associations of IGFBP-3 with clinical and pathologic variables as well as with patient survival. RESULTS: High IGFBP-3 levels resulted significantly associated with some of the favorable prognostic features of the disease, including early clinical stage (p=0.048), small size of residual tumor (p=0.007), and optimal debulking result (p=0.007). High IGFBP-3 was also associated with a significantly reduced risk for disease progression (RR=0.52, p=0.034) and we showed an inverse dose-dependent relationship between IGFBP-3 and disease progression-free survival (p=0.033). However, the association with disease progression-free survival was no longer statistically significant in a multivariate analysis. An association between IGFBP-3 and overall survival was not shown. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggest that IGFBP-3 may play a role in the progression of epithelial ovarian cancer.
11988840	Insulin-like growth factor-1 inscribes a gene expression profile for angiogenic factors and cancer progression in breast epithelial cells.	Activation of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) by IGF-1 is associated with the risk and progression of many types of cancer, although despite this it remains unclear how activated IGF-1R contributes to cancer progression. In this study, gene expression changes elicited by IGF-1 were profiled in breast epithelial cells. We noted that many genes are functionally linked to cancer progression and angiogenesis. To validate some of the changes observed, the RNA and/or protein was confirmed for c-fos, cytochrome P450 1A1, cytochrome P450 1B1, interleukin-1 beta, fas ligand, vascular endothelial growth factor, and urokinase plasminogen activator. Nuclear proteins were also temporally monitored to address how gene expression changes were regulated. We found that IGF-1 stimulated the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated AKT, hypoxic-inducible factor-1 alpha, and phosphorylated cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, which correlated with temporal changes in gene expression. Next, the promoter regions of IGF-1-regulated genes were searched in silico. The promoters of genes that clustered together had similar regulatory regions. In summary, IGF-1 inscribes a gene expression profile relevant to cancer progression, and this study provides insight into the mechanism(s) whereby some of these changes occur.
12360481	Effects of genetic blockade of the insulin-like growth factor receptor in human colon cancer cell lines.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I receptor (IGF-Ir) signaling is required for maintenance of growth and tumorigenicity of several tumor types. We have previously shown successful therapy in a lung cancer xenograft model using an adenovirus expressing antisense IGF-Ir. In this study, we sought to better dissect the mechanism and develop potentially more effective IGF-Ir-targeted therapeutics by developing and testing tetracycline-regulated and recombinant adenoviruses expressing dominant negative receptors. METHODS: Truncated IGF-I receptors (IGF-Ir/tf; 482 and 950 amino acids long, respectively [IGF-Ir/482st and IGF-Ir/950st]) were cloned into tetracycline-regulated vectors and recombinant adenoviruses and then studied in colorectal cancer cells. We assessed the effect of IGF-Ir/tf on signaling blockade, colony formation, stress response (serum starvation and heat), chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, and in vivo therapeutic efficacy in xenografts. RESULTS: Activation of IGF-Ir/tf expression by withdrawal of tetracycline suppressed tumorigenicity both in vitro and in vivo and up-regulated stressor-induced apoptosis. It effectively blocked both IGF-I- and IGF-II-induced activation of Akt-1. IGF-Ir/tf expression increased chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, and this combination therapy was very effective against tumors in mice. These findings were confirmed in a therapy model against established tumors using adenoviruses expressing IGF-Ir/tf. Moreover, IGF-Ir/482st was more effective than IGF-Ir/950st because of its bystander effect. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-tumor activity of IGF-Ir/tf is mediated through inhibition of Akt-1 and enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy. Adenovirus IGF-Ir/482st may be a useful anticancer therapeutic for colorectal carcinoma.
12438247	Reduced expression of insulin-like growth factor I receptors in MCF-7 breast cancer cells leads to a more metastatic phenotype.	Several lines of evidence support an important role for the insulin-like growth factor system in breast cancer. Alterations in insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) have been associated with breast cancer metastasis; however, the specific role played by the IGF-IR in this process remains unclear. To address this issue, we evaluated MCF-7 breast cancer cells stably transfected either with an antisense construct to the IGF-IR, which reduced the expression of the IGF-IRs by approximately 50% (SX13 cells), or with the empty vector as control (NEO cells). Using functional assays for motility, attachment, and aggregation, we found a 3-fold increase in migration using both the wounding assay and the Boyden chamber migration assay. In addition, the SX13 cells attached less, and there was a reduction in cellular aggregation. These functional changes were accompanied by approximately 50% decrease in expression of E-cadherin and approximately 80% increase in p120 protein levels. Moreover, there was a significant reduction in p120 present in the E-cadherin-catenin-p120 complex. There was a 2-fold increase in active Rac1 and Cdc42 and a 35% decrease in active Rho in the SX13 cells. Our findings strongly suggest that the IGF-IR plays a role in the stabilization of the E-cadherin-catenin complex, thereby providing one possible explanation for the association between low levels of IGF-IR and a higher risk of mammary tumor metastasis.
12890810	Insulin-like growth factor system gene expression in women with type 2 diabetes and breast cancer.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: A twofold increased risk for breast cancer has been reported recently for women with late onset diabetes. Most studies showed that there were differences in serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factors and related proteins between women with and without diabetes who have breast cancer. This study investigated the expression of these markers at the cellular level in a cohort of women with and without type 2 diabetes who underwent biopsy because of a breast lump. METHODS: Relative quantitative analysis of specific mRNA sequences was performed after extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification from formalin fixed and paraffin wax embedded tissues. Sixty seven breast surgical specimens from women with and without diabetes who did not have cancer and from women with and without diabetes who did have cancer were studied for insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), and oestrogen receptor 1 gene expression. RESULTS: The expression of IGF-I and IGF-IR was significantly lower in the cancer groups, whereas there was no significant difference for IGFBP-3 between women with and without cancer. Moreover, there was a good correlation between the expression of IGF-I and IGF-IR in women without cancer: this link was still present in breast tissue from patients with diabetes and cancer, whereas it was lost in patients without diabetes but with cancer. CONCLUSIONS: These differences in IGF-I/IGF-IR expression could contribute to the increased risk for breast cancer in women with type 2 diabetes.
12907612	Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 gene -202 A/C polymorphism is correlated with advanced disease status in prostate cancer.	The circulating level of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) is inversely associated with the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) and its progression and may be modulated by the A/C polymorphism at position -202 in the promoter region of IGFBP-3. This study was conducted to evaluate the role of the A/C polymorphism as a genetic modifier in the etiology of PCa and its disease status. The polymorphism was analyzed by a PCR restriction fragment-length polymorphism technique in 307 PCa patients, 221 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients, and 227 male controls. No significant difference in the genotype frequency was found between the PCa or BPH patients and controls (PCa versus control, P = 0.316; BPH versus control, P = 0.964). Regarding the tumor stage, the C allele was more frequently observed in patients having tumors with higher stage (P for trend = 0.002). When the PCa patients with localized disease (stage A + B + C) were considered as reference, those with CC and AC genotype had a significantly increased risk of metastatic disease (stage D) compared with those with AA genotype [age-adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.42-10.64, P = 0.008, and aOR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.01-2.79, P = 0.044, respectively]. The presence of the C allele appeared to be associated with an increased risk of metastatic PCa with a gene dosage effect (aOR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.23-2.68, P = 0.002). Similarly, significant findings were also observed when PCa patients were compared between those with organ-confined disease (stage A + B) and those with extra-prostatic extension (stage C + D). Furthermore, the C allele was present more frequently in patients with higher tumor grade. In conclusion, the IGFBP-3 -202 A/C polymorphism was not associated with susceptibility to PCa and BPH in Japanese men, but the presence of the C allele may cumulatively increase the risk for tumor metastasis and for having tumors with a biologically more aggressive phenotype. Because of the significant differences in incidence of clinically evident PCa according to racial backgrounds, the conjecture should be further examined in different racial populations.
12941837	An anti-insulin-like growth factor I receptor antibody that is a potent inhibitor of cancer cell proliferation.	An antagonistic monoclonal antibody, designated EM164, has been developed which binds specifically to the human insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) and inhibits the proliferation and survival functions of the receptor in cancer cells. EM164 was initially selected by a rapid cell-based screen of hybridoma supernatants to identify antibodies that bind to IGF-IR but not to the homologous insulin receptor and that show maximal inhibition of IGF-I-stimulated autophosphorylation of IGF-IR. EM164 binds tightly to IGF-IR with a dissociation constant K(d) of 0.1 nM, inhibits binding of IGF-I and antagonizes its effects on cells completely, and has no agonistic activity on its own. EM164 inhibits IGF-I-, IGF-II-, and serum-stimulated proliferation and survival of diverse human cancer cell lines in vitro, including breast, lung, colon, cervical, ovarian, pancreatic, melanoma, prostate, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and osteosarcoma cancer lines. It also suppresses the autocrine or paracrine proliferation of several cancer cell lines. EM164 was the most potent antagonistic anti-IGF-IR antibody tested when compared with several commercially available antibodies. The in vitro inhibitory effect could be extended to in vivo tumor models, where EM164 caused regression of established BxPC-3 human pancreatic tumor xenografts in SCID mice. The antitumor effect of treatment with EM164 could be enhanced by combining it with the cytotoxic agent gemcitabine. These data support the development of EM164 as a candidate therapeutic agent that targets IGF-IR function in cancer cells.
8595162	Expression of receptors for epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factor I by ZR-75-1 human breast cancer cell variants is inversely related: the effect of steroid hormones on insulin-like growth factor I receptor expression.	We have investigated the expression of insulin-like growth factor I receptors (IGFR) by the ZR-75-1 human breast cancer cell line and tamoxifen-resistant (ZR-75-9a1) and oestrogen-independent (ZR-PR-LT) variants. ZR-75-1 cells expressed 6633+/-953 receptors per cell,(K(d) 0.24+/-0.06 nM). IGFR expression was reduced in ZR-75-9a1 cells (1180+/-614 receptors per cell, K(d) 0.13+/-0.05) and increased in the ZR-PR-LT cell line (18 430+/-3210 receptors per cell, K(d) 0.24+/-17). A comparison of these data with previously published findings for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression by these cell lines revealed that IGFR and EGFR expression are inversely related in the variant lines whereas ZR-75-1 cells express similar numbers of both receptors. Since the changes in IGFR expression observed are associated with changes in steroid hormone receptor status, we also investigated the effects of oestradiol, the synthetic progestin ORG 2058 and dexamethasone on IGFR expression. Oestradiol increased IGFR expression only in the ZR-75-1 cell line. Low concentrations of ORG 2058 increased IGFR levels in the two cell lines positive for progesterone receptor (ZR-75-1 and ZR-PR-LT). High concentrations of ORG 2058 increased IGFR expression in all cell lines, as did dexamethasone. These data suggest that EGFR and IGFR expression may be linked in breast cancer, and that EGFR/IGFR ratios in breast cancer may be a more sensitive prognostic indicator than EGFR expression alone. Regardless of basal IGFR expression by the cell studied, ORG 2058 increased IGFR expression, possibly via both the progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors.
8771909	Assay of insulin receptors in mouse brain.	We previously demonstrated that mouse adrenergic system undergoes age-related impairments which can be reversed by grafting thymus into old animals. Recently, our attention is devoted to brain insulin receptors (InsRs), because of their possible involvement in neuromodulation of monoaminergic systems. The paucity of information on brain InsRs in general, and on mouse in particular, prompted us to look for methods by which brain InsR characteristics can be determined accurately, before beginning a study on possible age-dependent modifications of this receptor system and their eventual recovery by thymus graft. Brain insulin receptor characteristics were studied in a group of young Balb/c-nu mice by binding competition experiments, set up incubating fresh brain membranes with a constant amount of 125I-insulin in presence of increasing concentrations of cold insulin. Experimental data were analysed using both one-site and two-site models. Comparison of results demonstrates that curvilinear Scatchard plot of brain InsRs is indicative of the presence of two binding sites with high and low affinity, respectively. Data also shows that density and affinity of the high affinity receptor subset can be determined accurately, while the low affinity receptor subpopulation presents a high degree of interindividual variability for both density and affinity. It can be concluded that this method of determination of InsR characteristics can be safely used to deepen the study of thymus graft-induced recovery of age-related modifications of brain InsR system.
8833657	Affinity for the insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) receptor inhibits autocrine IGF-II activity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.	We have investigated the autocrine regulation of insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) signaling by the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin-like growth factor-II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor (IGF-IIR) in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, employing retroviruses encoding both IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGF-I and II mutants with reductions in affinity for either the IGF-IR or the IGF-IIR. These studies revealed reciprocal roles for IGF-IR and IGF-IIR affinity in the regulation of autocrine IGF-II activity. IGF-IR affinity was required for serum-free proliferation but also for efficient IGF-II secretion. In contrast, cellular proliferation, receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling, and extracellular IGF-II protein accumulation were all reduced in the presence of IGF-IIR affinity. Inhibition of IGF-II signaling appeared to be the sole consequence of IGF-IIR affinity, as no cellular responses attributable to selective IGF-IIR binding by a reduced IGF-IR affinity IGF-II mutant could be detected. By operating as an IGF-II antagonist, the IGF-IIR has tumor suppressor-like properties, a suggestion consistent with reports of loss of heterozygosity at the IGF-IIR locus in a variety of human malignancies.
9413807	Sporadic amplification of the insulin receptor gene in human breast cancer.	Insulin receptor (IR) content is increased in most human breast carcinomas when compared to normal breast tissue. In the present study we investigated IR gene copy number by using both conventional DNA analysis (slot blot) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Cultured human breast cell lines and primary breast carcinoma specimens were analyzed. In 6 breast cell lines in culture both techniques gave similar results: the relative IR copy number determined by FISH strongly correlated with slot blot results (r = 0.831), even if probes for different reference loci were used in the 2 methods. We find that in human breast cancer IR gene amplification is a sporadic event. It occurred in 1/5 cultured breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB 231) and in 8/93 (8.6%) breast cancer specimens. In contrast an increased copy number of the entire chromosome 19 (which contains IR gene) was frequently observed in both breast cancer cell lines (100%) and breast cancer specimens (45%). When present, IR gene amplification always occurred at low level. These data indicate that IR gene amplification is an uncommon event in human breast carcinomas and that mechanisms other than gene amplification are responsible for IR protein overexpression in most human breast cancers.
10542046	Cross-talk mechanisms in the development of insulin resistance of skeletal muscle cells palmitate rather than tumour necrosis factor inhibits insulin-dependent protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt stimulation and glucose uptake.	Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle is one of the earliest symptoms associated with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and nonesterified fatty acids have been proposed to be crucial factors in the development of the insulin-resistant state. We here show that, although TNF downregulated insulin-induced insulin receptor (IR) and IR substrate (IRS)-1 phosphorylation as well as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) activity in pmi28 myotubes, this was, unlike in adipocytes, not sufficient to affect insulin-induced glucose transport. Rather, TNF increased membrane expression of GLUT1 and glucose transport in these muscle cells. In contrast, the nonesterified fatty acid palmitate inhibited insulin-induced signalling cascades not only at the level of IR and IRS-1 phosphorylation, but also at the level protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), which is thought to be directly involved in the insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4, and inhibited insulin-induced glucose uptake. Palmitate also abrogated TNF-dependent enhancement of basal glucose uptake, suggesting that palmitate has the capacity to render muscle cells resistant not only to insulin but also to TNF with respect to glucose transport by GLUT4 and GLUT1, respectively. Our data illustrate the complexity of the mechanisms governing insulin resistance of skeletal muscle, questioning the role of TNF as a direct inhibitor of glucose homoeostasis in this tissue and shedding new light on an as yet unrecognized multifunctional role for the predominant nonesterified fatty acid palmitate in this process.
10570150	Defects in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor expression, Ca(2+) signaling, and insulin secretion in the anx7(+/-) knockout mouse.	The mammalian anx7 gene codes for a Ca(2+)-activated GTPase, which supports Ca(2+)/GTP-dependent secretion events and Ca(2+) channel activities in vitro and in vivo. To test whether anx7 might be involved in Ca(2+) signaling in secreting pancreatic beta cells, we knocked out the anx7 gene in the mouse and tested the insulin-secretory properties of the beta cells. The nullizygous anx7 (-/-) phenotype is lethal at embryonic day 10 because of cerebral hemorrhage. However, the heterozygous anx7 (+/-) mouse, although expressing only low levels of ANX7 protein, is viable and fertile. The anx7 (+/-) phenotype is associated with a substantial defect in insulin secretion, although the insulin content of the islets, is 8- to 10-fold higher in the mutants than in the normal littermate control. We infer from electrophysiological studies that both glucose-stimulated secretion and voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel functions are normal. However, electrooptical recordings indicate that the (+/-) mutation has caused a change in the ability of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3))-generating agonists to release intracellular calcium. The principle molecular consequence of lower anx7 expression is a profound reduction in IP(3) receptor expression and function in pancreatic islets. The profound increase in islets, beta cell number, and size may be a means of compensating for less efficient insulin secretion by individual defective pancreatic beta cells. This is a direct demonstration of a connection between glucose-activated insulin secretion and Ca(2+) signaling through IP(3)-sensitive Ca(2+) stores.
10674396	Multiple signaling pathways mediate interleukin-4-induced 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta5-delta4 isomerase type 1 gene expression in human breast cancer cells.	The 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta5-delta4 isomerase (3beta-HSD) isoenzymes catalyze an essential step in the formation of all classes of active steroid hormones. We have recently shown that 3beta-HSD type 1 gene expression is specifically induced by interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 in breast human cancer cell lines and in normal human mammary epithelial cells in primary culture. There is evidence that IL-4 stimulates bifurcating signaling pathways in which the signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 (Stat6)-signal pathway is involved in differentiation and gene regulation, whereas insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins mediate the mitogenic action of IL-4. In fact, we have shown that Stat6 was activated by IL-4 in all cell lines studied where IL-4 induced 3beta-HSD expression, but not in those that failed to respond to IL-4. The present study was designed to investigate the potential contribution of IRS proteins and their downstream targets to IL-4-induced 3beta-HSD type 1 gene expression. IL-4 rapidly induced IRS-1 and IRS-2 phosphorylation in ZR-75-1 human breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and insulin, which are well known to cause IRS-1 and IRS-2 phosphorylation, increased the stimulatory effect of IL-4 on 3beta-HSD activity. IRS-1 and IRS-2 are adapter molecules that provide docking sites for different SH2-domain-containing proteins such as the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. In this light, the inhibition of IL-4-induced 3beta-HSD expression by wortmannin and LY294002, two potent PI 3-kinase inhibitors, indicates the probable involvement of the PI 3-kinase signaling molecules in this response to IL-4. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the IRS proteins are part of the signaling complexes that lead to activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase by insulin; thus we investigated the potential role of the MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade in the IL-4 action. In ZR-75-1 cells, both the activation of MAPK by IL-4 and the IL-4-induced 3beta-HSD activity were completely blocked by PD98059, an inhibitor of MAPK activation. Wortmannin also blocked MAPK activation by IL-4, IGF-I, and insulin, suggesting that the MAPK cascade acts as a downstream effector of PI 3-kinases. To further understand the cross-talk between signaling pathways involved in IL-4 action, we investigated the possible involvement of protein kinase C (PKC). The potential role of PKC was suggested by the observation that the well known PKC activator phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) potentiated the IL-4-induced 3beta-HSD activity. Taken together, these findings suggest the existence of a novel mechanism of gene regulation by IL-4. This mechanism would involved the phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2, which transduce the IL-4 signal through a PI 3-kinase- and MAPK-dependent signaling pathway. The inability of IGF-I, insulin, and PMA to stimulate 3beta-HSD expression by themselves in the absence of IL-4 makes obvious the absolute requirement of an IL-4-specific signaling molecule. Our findings thus suggest that the multiple pathways downstream of IRS-1 and IRS-2 must act in cooperation with the IL-4-specific transcription factor Stat6 to mediate the induction of 31beta-HSD type 1 gene expression in ZR-75-1 human breast cancer cells.
10950308	New concepts in regulation and function of the insulin-like growth factors: implications for understanding normal growth and neoplasia.	The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are a ubiquitous family of growth factors, binding proteins and receptors that are involved in normal growth and development. They are also implicated in numerous pathological states, including malignancy. IGF-II is a commonly expressed growth factor in many tumors and may enhance tumor growth, acting via the overexpressed IGF-I receptor, a cell-surface tyrosine kinase receptor. The IGF-I receptor may be overexpressed due to mutations in tumor suppression gene products such as p53 and WT-1 or growth factors such as bFGF and PDGF. Thus, this family of growth factors, especially the IGF-I receptor, may present an excellent target for new therapeutic agents in the treatment of cancer and other disorders of excessive cellular proliferation.
11092520	Tumor necrosis factor-beta gene NcoI polymorphism decreases insulin resistance in Japanese men.	Given that the NcoI polymorphism of the tumor necrosis factor-beta (TNF-beta) gene has been shown to be associated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secretory capacity, we know that this TNF-beta gene polymorphism may influence insulin resistance. In Caucasians, 2 polymorphisms of the TNF-alpha promoter region (positions -308 and -238) have been reported to be associated with insulin resistance. Thus, we investigated how genetic variation in the TNF-beta and TNF-alpha genes was associated with insulin resistance in 211 Japanese men. The frequency of the TNF-beta gene polymorphism was 0.41, and insulin resistance, estimated by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), was significantly lower in variant homozygotes versus wild-type allele. The frequencies of the -308 and -238 polymorphisms were 0.01 and 0.02, respectively, and these polymorphisms were not associated with insulin resistance. Our results suggest that the TNF-beta gene polymorphism decreases insulin resistance, and that the -308 and -238 polymorphisms of the TNF-alpha promoter region are not a major contributing factor to insulin resistance in Japanese men.
11102895	Down-regulation of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 expression in advanced human breast cancer.	The ligands, receptors and related signaling proteins of the insulin-like growth factor family are involved in the regulation of breast-cancer cell growth. We investigated the expression pattern of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR), insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), a core downstream signaling protein, in 69 primary breast-cancer specimens of different grades and in 21 control tissues by immunohistochemistry. In addition, cell proliferation (percentage of Ki67(+) nuclei) and estrogen receptor (ER) expression were determined. IGF-IR, IRS-1 and IR were expressed mainly in epithelial cells. IRS-1 and IGF-IR were expressed at high levels in control tissues and in well and moderately differentiated carcinomas but at low levels in poorly differentiated breast cancers. IR expression did not show a significant correlation with the differentiation grade of the tissues investigated. Statistical analysis (ROC analysis for tumor grade) demonstrated that down-regulation of IGF-IR and IRS-1 correlated better with tumor progression than reduction of ER expression or increase in cell proliferation, IGF-IR showing the best correlation, followed by IRS-1 and, less significant, ER and Ki67. Our findings clearly show that progression of breast cancer is accompanied by a reduction of IGF-IR/IRS-1 expression and that IGF-IR/IRS-1 expression inversely correlates with high proliferation rate in dedifferentiated breast cancers. The strong correlation of IGF-IR and IRS-1 down-regulation with tumor progression suggests the use of IGF-IR and IRS-1 as a novel set of marker proteins for tumor grading.
11453542	Blockage of IGF-1R signaling sensitizes urinary bladder cancer cells to mitomycin-mediated cytotoxicity.	A major problem which is poorly understood in the management of bladder cancer is low sensitivity to chemotherapy and high recurrence after transurethral resection. Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling plays a very important role in progression, invasion and metastasis of bladder cancer cells. In this study, we investigated whether IGF-1R was involved in the growth stimulating activity and drug resistance of bladder cancer cells. The results showed: The mRNAs of IGF-1, IGF-2 and IGF-1R were strongly expressed in serum-free cultured T24 cell line, whereas normal urothelial cells did not express these factors/receptors or only in trace levels; T24 cell responded far better to growth stimulation by IGF-1 than did normal urothelial cells; blockage of IGF1R by antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) significantly inhibited the growth of T24 cell and enhanced sensitivity and apoptosis of T24 cells to mitomycin (MMC). These results suggested that blockage of IGF-IR signaling might potentially contribute to the treatment of bladder cancer cells which are insensitive to chemotherapy.
11559546	Differential insulin-like growth factor I receptor signaling and function in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 and ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.	The insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) is a ubiquitous and multifunctional tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in breast cancer development. In estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast tumors, the levels of the IGF-IR and its substrate, insulin-receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), are often elevated, and these characteristics have been linked with increased radioresistance and cancer recurrence. In vitro, activation of the IGF-IR/IRS-1 pathway in ER-positive cells improves growth and counteracts apoptosis induced by anticancer treatments. The function of the IGF-IR in hormone-independent breast cancer is not clear. ER-negative breast cancer cells often express low levels of the IGF-IR and fail to respond to IGF-I with mitogenesis. On the other hand, anti-IGF-IR strategies effectively reduced metastatic potential of different ER-negative cell lines, suggesting a role of this receptor in late stages of the disease. Here we examined IGF-IR signaling and function in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and their IGF-IR-overexpressing derivatives. We demonstrated that IGF-I acts as a chemoattractant for these cells. The extent of IGF-I-induced migration reflected IGF-IR levels and required the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) and p38 kinases. The same pathways promoted IGF-I-dependent motility in ER-positive MCF-7 cells. In contrast with the positive effects on cell migration, IGF-I was unable to stimulate growth or improve survival in MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas it induced mitogenic and antiapoptotic effects in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, IGF-I partially restored growth in ER-positive cells treated with PI-3K and ERK1/ERK2 inhibitors, whereas it had no protective effects in ER-negative cells. The impaired IGF-I growth response of ER-negative cells was not caused by a low IGF-IR expression, defective IGF-IR tyrosine phosphorylation, or improper tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Also, the acute (15-min) IGF-I activation of PI-3 and Akt kinases was similar in ER-negative and ER-positive cells. However, a chronic (2-day) IGF-I exposure induced the PI-3K/Akt pathway only in MCF-7 cells. The reactivation of this pathway in ER-negative cells by overexpression of constitutively active Akt mutants was not sufficient to significantly improve proliferation or survival (with or without IGF-I), which indicated that other pathways are also required to support these functions. Our results suggest that in breast cancer cells, IGF-IR can control nonmitogenic processes regardless of the ER status, whereas IGF-IR growth-related functions may depend on ER expression.
11694888	Structure and autoregulation of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor kinase.	The insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) receptor is closely related to the insulin receptor. However, the unique biological functions of IGF1 receptor make it a target for therapeutic intervention in human cancer. Using its isolated tyrosine kinase domain, we show that the IGF1 receptor is regulated by intermolecular autophosphorylation at three sites within the kinase activation loop. Steady-state kinetic analyses of the isolated phosphorylated forms of the IGF1 receptor kinase (IGF1RK) reveal that each autophosphorylation event increases enzyme turnover number and decreases Km for ATP and peptide. We have determined the 2.1 A-resolution crystal structure of the tris-phosphorylated form of IGF1RK in complex with an ATP analog and a specific peptide substrate. The structure of IGF1RK reveals how the enzyme recognizes peptides containing hydrophobic residues at the P+1 and P+3 positions and how autophosphorylation stabilizes the activation loop in a conformation that facilitates catalysis. Although the nucleotide binding cleft is conserved between IGF1RK and the insulin receptor kinase, sequence differences in the nearby interlobe linker could potentially be exploited for anticancer drug design.
12888657	Conjugated linoleic acid downregulates insulin-like growth factor-I receptor levels in HT-29 human colon cancer cells.	Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has chemoprotective properties in a variety of experimental cancer models. We have previously observed that dietary CLA inhibits colon tumorigenesis induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine in rats. In addition, our in vitro studies have shown that CLA inhibits DNA synthesis and induces apoptosis in HT-29 cells, the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line. The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system regulates the growth of HT-29 cells by an autocrine mechanism. The present study examined whether the growth inhibitory effect of CLA is related to changes in the IGF system in HT-29 cells. To determine whether CLA inhibits IGF-II production, HT-29 cells were incubated in serum-free medium in the presence of various concentrations of CLA. CLA decreased protein levels of both mature and pro IGF-II and IGF-II transcripts. Whereas exogenous IGF-I and IGF-II produced an increase in cell number, neither IGF-I nor IGF-II counteracted the negative growth regulatory effect of CLA. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis of total cell lysates revealed that CLA decreased IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) transcript and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. Immunoprecipitation/Western blot studies revealed that CLA inhibited IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of IGF-IR and insulin-receptor substrate (IRS)-1, recruitment of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) to IGF-IR, IGF-IR-associated PI3K activity, and phosphorylated Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 levels. In conclusion, the inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis by CLA in HT-29 cells may be mediated in part by its ability to decrease IGF-II synthesis and to downregulate IGF-IR signaling and the PI3K/Akt and ERK-1/2 pathways.
12937141	Regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor, and angiogenesis by an insulin-like growth factor-I receptor autocrine loop in human pancreatic cancer.	Activation of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) was recently shown to modulate angiogenesis by up-regulating the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We hypothesized that inhibiting IGF-IR function would inhibit angiogenesis and growth of pancreatic cancer in vivo and sought to identify major signaling pathways regulated by IGF-IR in pancreatic cancer cells. Human pancreatic cancer cells (L3.6pl) were stably transfected with a dominant-negative form of IGF-IR (IGF-IR DN) or an empty vector (pcDNA). In vitro, IGF-IR DN cells exhibited a decrease in both constitutive and inducible phosphorylation of IGF-IR and Erk1/2. Constitutive expression of nuclear hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and secreted VEGF (P < 0.01) protein levels also were significantly lower in IGF-IR DN cells than in pcDNA cells. In vivo, IGF-IR inhibition led to decreases in pancreatic tumor volume and weight, vessel density, and tumor cell proliferation (P < 0.01 for all) and increases in tumor cell apoptosis (P < 0.02). Our results suggest that autocrine activation of the IGF-IR system significantly affects VEGF expression and angiogenesis in human pancreatic cancer. Thus, IGF-IR may be a valid target in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
7743492	Insulin-like growth factor I overexpression in human pancreatic cancer: evidence for autocrine and paracrine roles.	We assessed the potential roles of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) in human pancreatic cancer. IGF-I enhanced the growth of ASPC-1 and COLO-357 human pancreatic cancer cells, and this effect was significantly inhibited by a highly specific monoclonal anti-IGF-IR antibody (alpha IR3). Both cell lines expressed mRNA transcripts for IGF-IR, and basal cell growth was significantly reduced by an IGF-IR antisense oligodeoxynucleotide. IGF-I mRNA transcripts were not detected in either cell line or in two additional pancreatic cancer cell lines. In contrast, analysis of 12 pancreatic cancers revealed a 32-fold increase (P < 0.01) in IGF-I mRNA levels by comparison with the low levels observed in the normal pancreas. By in situ hybridization, IGF-I mRNA grains were present in both the cancer cells and in the surrounding connective tissue. Six of the cancers exhibited a 4.4-fold increase in IGF-IR mRNA levels. These findings suggest that IGF-I may participate in aberrant autocrine and paracrine activation of IGF-IR in pancreatic cancer in vivo.
8111378	The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor gene is normally biallelically expressed in human juvenile tissue and tumours.	We have examined insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) gene expression for evidence of imprinting in 15 informative patients with embryonal tumours. Biallelic expression was observed in all but one sample of normal juvenile kidney and liver, and in 9/10 associated Wilms' tumours, 3/3 hepatoblastomas and 2/2 adrenal tumours. A single patient with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) demonstrated monoallelic expression of the maternally derived IGF1R allele in normal kidney, associated Wilms' tumour and in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The observed biallelic expression of the IGF1R gene in all but one patient strongly suggests that the human gene is not normally imprinted.
8244804	High-dose preoperative radiation for cancer of the rectum: impact of radiation dose on patterns of failure and survival.	PURPOSE: A variety of dose-time schedules are currently used for preoperative radiation therapy of rectal cancer. An analysis of patients treated with high-dose preoperative radiation therapy was undertaken to determine the influence of radiation dose on the patterns of failure, survival, and complications. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two hundred seventy-five patients with localized rectal cancer were treated with high-dose preoperative radiation therapy. One hundred fifty-six patients received 45 Gy, +/- 10% (low-dose group). Since 1985, 119 patients with clinically unfavorable cancers (fixed, low-lying, or deeply ulcerated) were given a higher dose, 55 Gy, +/- 10%, using a shrinking field technique (high-dose group). All patients underwent curative resection. Median follow-up was 66 months in the low-dose group and 28 months in the high-dose group. Patterns of failure, survival, and complications were analyzed as a function of radiation dose. RESULTS: Fourteen percent (38/275) of the total group developed a local recurrence; 20% (31/156) in the low-dose group as compared with 6% (7/119) in the high-dose group. The actuarial local recurrence rate at 5 years was 20% for the low-dose group and 8% for the high-dose group, and approached statistical significance with p = .057. For tethered/fixed tumors the actuarial local recurrence rates at 5 years were 28% and 9%, respectively, with p = .05. Similarly, for low-lying tumors (less than 6 cm from the anorectal junction) the rates were 24% and 9%, respectively, with p = .04. The actuarial rate of distant metastasis was 28% in the low-dose group and 20% in the high-dose group and was not significantly different. Overall actuarial 5-year survival for the total group of patients was 66%. No significant difference in survival was observed between the two groups, despite the higher proportion of unfavorable cancers in the high-dose group. The incidence of complications was 2%, equally distributed between the two groups. CONCLUSION: High-dose preoperative radiation therapy for rectal cancer results in excellent local control rates. However, in clinically unfavorable cancers a higher dose (55 Gy) of preoperative radiation can be given safely with significantly improved local control. Careful clinical staging is helpful in selectively treating patients with unfavorable tumors to a higher preoperative radiation dose and thus optimizing their outcome.
8532629	Prenatal analysis of the insulin receptor gene in a family with leprechaunism.	We report on the prenatal diagnosis of a fetus at risk of leprechaunism. We had previously determined the nature of the causative mutation in the insulin receptor gene in this family. The mutation removes a restriction site for the enzyme Mbo II. Genomic DNA was extracted from a chorionic villus sample and the 3' half of exon 2 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction digest. Using this method, we correctly predicted an unaffected child.
9311601	Differential roles of IRS-1 and SHC signaling pathways in breast cancer cells.	Several polypeptide growth factors stimulate breast cancer growth and may be involved in tumor progression. However, the relative importance of diverse growth factor signaling pathways in the development and maintenance of the neoplastic phenotype is largely unknown. The activation of such growth factor receptors as the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-I R), erbB-type receptors (erbB Rs) and FGF receptors (FGF Rs) controls the phenotype of a model breast cancer cell line MCF-7. To evaluate the function of 2 post-receptor signaling molecules, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) (a major substrate of the IGF-IR) and SHC (a common substrate of tyrosine kinase receptors), we developed several MCF-7-derived cell clones in which the synthesis of either IRS-1 or SHC was blocked by antisense RNA. In MCF-7 cells, down-regulation of IRS-1 by 80-85% strongly suppressed anchorage-dependent and -independent growth and induced apoptotic cell death under growth factor- and estrogen-reduced conditions. The reduction of SHC levels by approximately 50% resulted in the inhibition of monolayer and anchorage-independent growth but did not decrease cell survival. Importantly, cell aggregation and the ability of cells to survive on the extracellular matrix were inhibited in MCF-7/anti-SHC clones, but not in MCF-7/anti-IRS-1 clones. Cell motility toward IGF was not attenuated in any of the tested cell lines, but motility toward EGF was decreased in MCF-7/anti-SHC clones. Our results suggest that in MCF-7 cells: 1) both IRS-1 and SHC are implicated in the control of monolayer and anchorage-independent growth; 2) IRS-1 is critical to support cell survival; 3) SHC is involved in EGF-dependent motility; and 4) normal levels of SHC, but not IRS-1, are necessary for the formation and maintenance of cell-cell interactions.
9545345	Insulin receptor substrate-1 is the predominant signaling molecule activated by insulin-like growth factor-I, insulin, and interleukin-4 in estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer cells.	Because insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), insulin, and interleukin-4 (IL-4) have known biological effects in breast cancer cells and signal through insulin-receptor substrate (IRS) adaptor proteins, we examined the expression and function of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in breast tumors and cell lines. IRS-1 and IRS-2 were expressed by cell lines and primary breast tumor specimens. IGF-I, insulin, and IL-4 treatment of MCF-7 and ZR-75, and IGF-I treatment of T47-D breast cancer cells, resulted in much greater tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 compared with IRS-2. Furthermore, IGF-I stimulated greater tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 than either insulin or IL-4. IGF-I treatment also enhanced association of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with IRS-1 and stimulated increased enzymatic activity compared with IL-4 and insulin in all three cell lines. Similarly, mitogen-activated protein kinase activity was greater in IGF-I-stimulated cells. To determine the functional significance of the activation of these pathways, we inhibited activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with wortmannin and mitogen-activated protein kinase with PD098059. Both compounds inhibited IGF-stimulated growth, suggesting that both pathways contributed to the mitogenic response to IGF-I. We conclude that IRS-1, and not IRS-2, is the predominant signaling molecule activated by IGF-I, insulin, and IL-4. Furthermore, enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by IGF-I, compared with either insulin or IL-4, is associated with greater activation of mitogenic downstream signaling pathways resulting in enhanced cell growth.
9605520	Insulin receptor substrate 1 antisense expression in an hepatoma cell line reduces cell proliferation and induces overexpression of the Src homology 2 domain and collagen protein (SHC).	In mammalian cells, the insulin receptor substrate 1 protein (IRS-1) is a specific substrate for insulin and IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinases which is involved in mediating metabolic and mitogenic actions of insulin and IGFs. In order to determine if IRS-1 is also essential in a chicken derived hepatoma cell line (LMH cells), IRS-1 gene has been invalidated in these cells. For this, we subcloned chicken IRS-1 gene in an antisense orientation into a mammalian expression vector driven by the cytomegalovirus early promoter. LMH cells were stably transfected with this construct or with the empty vector carrying only the neomycin resistance gene and selected for cIRS-1 expression. One subclone, C2, showed a complete repression of cIRS-1 expression at both protein and mRNA levels. Proliferation of C2 cells was dramatically reduced (54%) compared with Neo(r) cells. Furthermore this reduction was accompanied by a decrease in insulin-dependent [3H]thymidine incorporation, indicating a reduction in DNA synthesis. Insulin-dependent [U-14C]glucose incorporation into cellular lipids was also significantly reduced in C2 cell line suggesting an alteration in lipogenesis. In wild type LMH cells, SHC which is involved in Ras pathway, also served as a substrate for insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. In C2 cells, SHC expression, its association with the insulin receptor and its tyrosine phosphorylation were largely increased. Two forms of the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase were present: p85 and p55 forms. Furthermore, C2 cells displayed increased basal phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3'-kinase activity. This report demonstrates a role for cIRS-1 in the metabolic and mitogenic actions of insulin in LMH cells. However, the overexpression of cIRS-1 antisense did not completely abolish cell proliferation. This may be explained by the exacerbation of an alternative pathway that only partly compensate for the knocking out of cIRS-1 gene: the overexpression of SHC.
10093629	How interested is the public in genetic testing for colon cancer susceptibility? Report of a cross-sectional population survey.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the public's interest in genetic testing for colon cancer susceptibility, to determine whether provision of information about the accuracy of the test or the population risk of inheriting the colon cancer gene influences interest, to determine the reasons for wanting to be tested and to identify the factors related to interest in testing. DESIGN: A cross-sectional random digit dialing telephone survey of 501 adults. SETTING: Ontario. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of the public interested in genetic testing; reasons for interest in testing. RESULTS: Of the sample, 39.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35.5 to 44.3) stated that they would be very interested in taking a simple blood test if a positive result suggested they had an 80% chance of getting colon cancer sometime during their lifetime. When it was suggested that the test might be accurate only 90% of the time, 33.1% of the sample (95% CI 28.7 to 37.5) still said they would be very interested in testing. When informed that less than 1% of the population inherits the gene for colon cancer, the proportion of the sample stating they would still be very interested in genetic testing fell to 19.2% (95% CI 14.8 to 23.6). The main reasons given for wanting genetic testing were to take preventive action, for peace of mind and curiosity. For respondents who remained interested in testing after being given information about the population risk of inheriting the gene, 2 factors were identified by logistic regression analysis as being independently related to interest: worry about cancer and perceived risk of getting colon cancer. CONCLUSIONS: If the public's interest in testing for colon cancer susceptibility has any influence on its eventual request to be tested, then demand for genetic testing may be considerable once such tests become widely available and known to the public. This study reveals that the public's interest in genetic testing is substantial, although modifiable by the provision of information about the population risk of inheriting a colon cancer gene. This finding suggests that genetic researchers and others should be careful to provide the population risk of inheriting cancer genes when discussing the discovery of these genes with the media. Furthermore, public health educators will need to ensure that information aids include material on familial risk criteria, genetic counselling and genetic testing, as well as on the implications of genetic testing, the general population risk of developing colon cancer and the general population risk of carrying the colon cancer gene. This information should also be provided to those who seek assessment, to health care professionals and to the public.
11384880	Multiple signal transduction pathways mediate interleukin-4-induced 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta5-Delta4 isomerase in normal and tumoral target tissues.	The 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta5-Delta4 isomerase (3beta-HSD) isoenzymes catalyze an essential step in the formation of all classes of active steroid hormones. We have recently shown that 3beta-HSD type 1 gene expression is specifically induced by interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 in several human cancer cell lines and in normal human mammary and prostatic epithelial cells in primary culture. There is evidence that IL-4 stimulates bifurcating signaling pathways in which the Stat6-signal pathway is involved in differentiation and gene regulation, whereas insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins mediate the mitogenic action of IL-4. As a matter of fact, we have shown that IL-4-activated Stat6 in all cell lines studied, where IL-4 induced 3beta-HSD type 1 expression but not in those cell lines that failed to respond to IL-4. The mechanism of the induction of 3beta-HSD type 1 gene expression was further characterized in ZR-75-1 human breast cancer cells. We have also found that IL-4 rapidly induced IRS-1 and IRS-2 phosphorylation in these cell lines. Moreover, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and insulin, which are well known to cause IRS-1 and IRS-2 phosphorylation, increased the stimulatory effect of IL-4 on 3beta-HSD activity. IRS-1 and IRS-2 are adapter molecules that provide docking sites for different SH2 domain-containing proteins, leading to the activation of multiple pathways, such as the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) pathways. The inhibition of IL-4-induced 3beta-HSD expression by PI 3-kinase inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002) as well as an inhibitor of MAP kinase activation (PD98059), indicates the involvement of those pathways in this response to IL-4. Wortmannin also blocked MAP kinase activation by IL-4, insulin and IGF-1 suggesting that the MAP kinase cascade acts as a downstream effector of PI 3-kinases. Furthermore, we showed that the PKC activator phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) also potentiated the IL-4-induced 3beta-HSD activity, thus suggesting that one signaling molecule that is involved in the signal transduction of the IL-4 action on 3beta-HSD type 1 expression is also a substrate for PKC. Taken together, these findings suggest the existence of a novel mechanism of gene regulation by IL-4. This mechanism would involve in the phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2, which transduce the IL-4 signal through a PI 3-kinase- and MAP kinase-dependent signaling pathway. However, the inability of IGF-1, insulin and PMA to stimulate 3beta-HSD type 1 expression by themselves in the absence of IL-4 indicates that the multiple pathways downstream of IRS-1 and IRS-2 must act in cooperation with an IL-4-specific signaling molecule, such as the transcription factor Stat6. It is also of interest to note that there also appear to be differences between the regulation of the 3beta-HSD type 1 and type 2 promoters.
11579209	Phosphorylation of PTP1B at Ser(50) by Akt impairs its ability to dephosphorylate the insulin receptor.	PTP1B is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that negatively regulates insulin sensitivity by dephosphorylating the insulin receptor. Akt is a ser/thr kinase effector of insulin signaling that phosphorylates substrates at the consensus motif RXRXXS/T. Interestingly, PTP1B contains this motif (RYRDVS(50)), and wild-type PTP1B (but not mutants with substitutions for Ser(50)) was significantly phosphorylated by Akt in vitro. To determine whether PTP1B is a substrate for Akt in intact cells, NIH-3T3(IR) cells transfected with either wild-type PTP1B or PTP1B-S50A were labeled with [(32)P]-orthophosphate. Insulin stimulation caused a significant increase in phosphorylation of wild-type PTP1B that could be blocked by pretreatment of cells with wortmannin or cotransfection of a dominant inhibitory Akt mutant. Similar results were observed with endogenous PTP1B in untransfected HepG2 cells. Cotransfection of constitutively active Akt caused robust phosphorylation of wild-type PTP1B both in the absence and presence of insulin. By contrast, PTP1B-S50A did not undergo phosphorylation in response to insulin. We tested the functional significance of phosphorylation at Ser(50) by evaluating insulin receptor autophosphorylation in transfected Cos-7 cells. Insulin treatment caused robust receptor autophosphorylation that could be substantially reduced by coexpression of wild-type PTP1B. Similar results were obtained with coexpression of PTP1B-S50A. However, under the same conditions, PTP1B-S50D had an impaired ability to dephosphorylate the insulin receptor. Moreover, cotransfection of constitutively active Akt significantly inhibited the ability of wild-type PTP1B, but not PTP1B-S50A, to dephosphorylate the insulin receptor. We conclude that PTP1B is a novel substrate for Akt and that phosphorylation of PTP1B by Akt at Ser(50) may negatively modulate its phosphatase activity creating a positive feedback mechanism for insulin signaling.
12374697	Blockade of insulin-like growth factor I receptor function inhibits growth and angiogenesis of colon cancer.	PURPOSE AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) I and II and their principle receptor, IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), are frequently expressed in human colon cancers and play a role in preventing apoptosis, enhancing cell proliferation, and inducing expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). To elucidate the in vitro and in vivo effects of IGF-IR in human colon cancer growth and angiogenesis, HT29 cells were transfected with a truncated dominant-negative (DN) form of IGF-IR or vector alone. RESULTS: IGF-I increased VEGF expression in parental and vector-transfected cells, whereas IGF-I induction of VEGF mRNA and protein was abrogated in IGF-IR DN cells. The IGF-IR DN cells demonstrated inhibited growth in both monolayer culture and soft agar (P < 0.05). s.c. injections of IGF-IR DN cells in nude mice led to significantly decreased tumor growth (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that IGF-I DN tumors demonstrated decreased tumor cell proliferation, VEGF expression, and vessel count and increased tumor cell apoptosis (P < 0.05 for all parameters compared with controls). Furthermore, IGF-IR DN-transfected cells yielded significantly decreased tumorigenicity and growth in the liver. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that the IGF ligand-receptor system plays an important role in multiple mechanisms that mediate human colon cancer growth including regulation of VEGF and angiogenesis.
12379772	Impact of insulin-like growth factor receptor-I function on angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis of colon cancer.	Insulin-like growth factors and their principal receptor, IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), are frequently expressed in human colon cancers and play a role in preventing apoptosis, enhancing cell proliferation, and inducing expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The role of IGF-IR in regulating angiogenesis and metastases of human colon cancer has not been elucidated. To determine the in vitro and in vivo effects of IGF-IR in human colon cancer growth and angiogenesis, human KM12L4 colon cancer cells were transfected with a truncated dominant-negative form of IGF-IR (IGF-IR dom-neg). IGF-IR dom-neg-transfected cells demonstrated markedly decreased constitutive expression of VEGF mRNA and protein. Subcutaneous injections of IGF-IR dom-neg-transfected cells in nude mice led to significantly decreased tumor growth (p < 0.05) that was associated with decreased tumor cell proliferation, VEGF expression, and vessel count and with increased tumor cell apoptosis (p < 0.05 for all parameters compared with controls). In addition, pericyte coverage of endothelial cells was significantly decreased in tumors from IGF-IR dom-neg-transfected cells. Following this observation, we demonstrated in vitro that vascular smooth muscle cells migrated significantly less in conditioned medium derived from IGF-IR dom-neg-transfected cells compared with medium from control cells. After splenic injections, IGF-IR dom-neg transfectants failed to produce liver metastases, in contrast to parental cells and mock transfectants (p < 0.05). In addition, IGF-IR dom-neg-transfected cells failed to form liver tumors after direct injection into the liver. These studies demonstrate that the IGF-IR plays an important role in multiple mechanisms that mediate the growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis of human colon cancer. IGF-IR is a valid target for the therapy of human colon cancer.
12489029	Recombinant adenoviruses expressing dominant negative insulin-like growth factor-I receptor demonstrate antitumor effects on lung cancer.	The continuous growth of tumors depends on the altered regulation of the cell cycle, which is in turn modulated by signals from growth factors and their receptors. Blockade of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and IGF-IR by antisense or dominant negative plasmid transfection can suppress tumorigenicity and induce regression of established tumors. We have constructed two recombinant adenoviruses: an adenovirus expressing truncated IGF-IR (ad-IGF-IR/950) with an engineered stop codon at amino acid residue 950, and an adenovirus expressing the soluble extracellular domain of IGF-IR (ad-IGF-IR/482) with an engineered stop codon at amino acid residue 482. Ad-IGF-IR/950 produces a defective receptor with an intact alpha subunit and a defective beta subunit lacking the tyrosine kinase domain. Dominant negative inhibition results from competition of the defective receptor with normal IGF-IR subunits, or the competition with normal IGF-IR for ligand by the soluble receptor. We were able to show here that ad-IGF-IR/950 induced the increased expression of IGF-IR on the cell surface and ad-IGF-IR/482 induced the secretion of the soluble fragment of IGF-IR. The transduction of both ad-IGF-IR/950 and ad-IGF-IR/482 could blunt the growth-stimulatory effect of IGF-I on human lung cancer cell lines. Both ad-IGF-IR/950 and ad-IGF-IR/482 effectively blocked IGF-I-induced Akt kinase activation. Intratumoral injection of ad-IGF-IR/482 virus showed significant growth suppression in established lung cancer xenografts. These findings suggest that these ad-IGF-IR/dn (950, 482) have the potential to be effective and practical cancer gene therapy strategies.
12566306	A chimeric humanized single-chain antibody against the type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor renders breast cancer cells refractory to the mitogenic effects of IGF-I.	Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) stimulate breast cancer proliferation, motility, and survival. The type I IGF receptor (IGF1R) mediates the effects of IGF-I. Thus, inhibition of IGF1R activation could inhibit IGF action in breast cancer cells. A single-chain antibody directed against IGF1R (IGF1R scFv-Fc) has been shown to partially inhibit xenograft growth of MCF-7 cells in athymic mice. In this study, we have examined the effects of scFv-Fc on IGF1R signaling in the estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The antibody stimulated IGF1R activation in vitro in MCF-7 cells and was unable to block IGF-I effects. The antibody also stimulated proliferation of MCF-7 cells in monolayer growth assays. To determine how scFv-Fc could stimulate in vitro growth yet inhibit in vivo tumor growth, we examined the effect of scFv-Fc on IGF1R expression. In MCF-7 cells, scFv-Fc down-regulated IGF1R levels after 2 h, and the levels were greatly reduced after 24 h. In contrast, IGF-I treatment over the same time period did not affect IGF1R levels. Twenty-four-h pretreatment of cells with scFv-Fc blocked IGF-I mediated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and subsequent extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase activation. In contrast, cells treated with 5 nM IGF-I for 24 h still retained the ability to further activate downstream signaling pathways in response to IGF-I. Moreover, pretreatment of MCF-7 cells with scFv-Fc rendered them refractory to further proliferation induced by additional IGF-I. Twenty-four-h pretreatment of cells with scFv-Fc also inhibited IGF-I stimulated anchorage-independent growth. scFv-Fc did not enhance antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In vivo, treatment of mice bearing MCF-7 xenograft tumors with scFv-Fc resulted in near complete down-regulation of IGF1R. Our data show that scFv-Fc stimulates biochemical activation of IGF1R, then causes receptor down-regulation, making MCF-7 cells refractory to additional IGF-I exposure. These results indicate that such chimeric single-chain antibodies against IGF1R have future potential in breast cancer therapy by causing down-regulation of receptor.
12746329	Signaling differences from the A and B isoforms of the insulin receptor (IR) in 32D cells in the presence or absence of IR substrate-1.	The A isoform of the insulin receptor (IR) is frequently overexpressed in cancer cells and is activated by IGF-II as well as by insulin, whereas the B isoform is predominant in differentiated tissues and responds poorly to IGF-II. The IR substrate-1 (IRS-1), a docking protein for the IR, is known to send a mitogenic signal and to be a powerful inhibitor of cell differentiation. We have investigated the biological effects of the two IR isoforms in parental 32D hemopoietic cells, which do not express IRS-1, and in 32D-derived cells in which IRS-1 is ectopically expressed. The effects of the two isoforms on cell survival, differentiation markers and nuclear translocation of IRS-1 were compared. The results confirm that the A isoform responds to IGF-II and preferentially sends mitogenic, antiapoptotic signals, whereas the B form, poorly responsive to IGF-II, tends to send differentiation signals.
8692980	Antisense RNA to the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor suppresses tumor growth and prevents invasion by rat prostate cancer cells in vivo.	Prostate carcinoma is the second leading cause of death from malignancy in men in the United States. Prostate cancer cells express type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) and prostate cancer selectively metastazises to bone, which is an environment rich in insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), thereby supporting a paracrine action for cancer cell proliferation. We asked whether the IGF-IR is coupled to tumorigenicity and invasion of prostate cancer. When rat prostate adenocarcinoma cells (PA-III) were stably transfected with an antisense IGF-IR expression construct containing the ZnSO4-inducible metallothionein-1 transcriptional promoter, the transfectants expressed high levels of IGF-IR antisense RNA after induction with ZnSO4, which resulted in dramatically reduced levels of endogenous IGF-IR mRNA. A significant reduction in expression both of tissue-type plasminogen activator and of urokinase-type plasminogen activator occurred in PA-III cells accompanying inhibition of IGF-IR. Subcutaneous injection of either nontransfected PA-III or PA-III cells transfected with vector minus the IGF-IR insert into nude mice resulted in large tumors after 4 weeks. However, mice injected with IGF-IR antisense-transfected PA-III cells either developed tumors 90% smaller than controls or remained tumor-free after 60 days of observation. When control-transfected PA-III cells were inoculated over the abraded calvaria of nude mice, large tumors formed with invasion of tumor cells into the brain parenchyma. In contrast, IGF-IR antisense transfectants formed significantly smaller tumors with no infiltration into brain. These results indicate an important role for the IGF/IGF-IR pathway in metastasis and provide a basis for targeting IGF-IR as a potential treatment for prostate cancer.
8806962	Malignant neoplasms associated with seborrheic keratoses. An analysis of 54 cases.	The association of malignant neoplasms arising contiguous with or adjacent to seborrheic keratoses has been previously documented. In this study a retrospective analysis was performed to further characterize these combined neoplasms. A total of 54 examples of malignant neoplasms in conjunction with seborrheic keratoses were found, of which 43 were basal cell carcinomas, six were Bowen's disease, three were keratoacanthomas, and two were malignant melanomas. The average age of the patients was over 65 years. Men were affected more frequently then women. The posterior thorax was the most common site for malignant neoplasms associated with seborrheic keratoses. The superficial type of basal cell carcinoma was the most common type of basal cell carcinoma found in this association. All subtypes of seborrheic keratosis may be found together with malignant neoplasms. We believe the appellation collision tumor is not valid because it is unknown whether the association of seborrheic keratoses with malignant neoplasms is a random event or whether there is, in fact, a pathogenic relationship in the development of two distinctive neoplasms together. Therefore, the term compound tumor is proposed to designate the finding of two distinctive neoplasms either directly contiguous with each other or immediately adjacent to each other.
9199203	Insulin-like growth factor I induces tumor hexokinase RNA expression in cancer cells.	Increased glycolysis is a characteristic of cancer cells. Though less efficient in energy production, it ensures continuous supply of energy and phosphometabolites for biosynthesis enabling metastatic and less vascularized cancer cells to proliferate even under hypoxic conditions. Since hexokinase is the first rate limiting enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, elevated levels of Type II like hexokinase in tumors are of great significance in this context. Under normal conditions insulin regulates expression of hexokinase Type II isoenzyme, which is predominantly expressed in muscle. On the other hand cancer cells overexpress insulin-like growth factors and their receptors which mimic many activities of insulin. This prompted us to examine a hypothesis that insulin-like growth factors may be responsible for overexpression of tumor hexokinase. Our experiments demonstrate that insulin-like growth factor I indeed induces hexokinase gene expression in a concentration and time dependent manner in two cancer cell lines we studied.
9515800	Elevated insulin-like growth factor I receptor autophosphorylation and kinase activity in human breast cancer.	Insulin-like growth factor I action has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many different malignancies, including breast cancer. Insulin-like growth factor I receptors (IGF-IRs) are overexpressed in virtually all breast cancer cell lines, in which they are believed to enhance growth and inhibit apoptosis. In this study, the functional activity of IGF-IRs from normal and malignant human breast tissue was assessed. IGF-IR expression was 14-fold higher in malignant breast tissue than in normal breast tissue. IGF-IR autophosphorylation and kinase activity were 2-4-fold higher in purified receptor preparations from malignant breast tissue as compared to normal breast tissue when normalized for receptor number. This increase in receptor function, coupled with the enhanced receptor expression, amounts to a 40-fold elevation in IGF-IR tyrosine kinase activity in malignant breast tissue. The enhanced receptor autophosphorylation and kinase activity were observed in the absence of hormonal stimulation and seem to result from an alteration in the intrinsic activity of the receptor itself. Protein tyrosine phosphatase activity is also increased in malignant breast tissue. These data suggest that the IGF-IR is an important target for breast cancer therapy.
10207053	Insulin receptor isoform A, a newly recognized, high-affinity insulin-like growth factor II receptor in fetal and cancer cells.	Insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) is a peptide growth factor that is homologous to both insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and insulin and plays an important role in embryonic development and carcinogenesis. IGF-II is believed to mediate its cellular signaling via the transmembrane tyrosine kinase type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-I-R), which is also the receptor for IGF-I. Earlier studies with both cultured cells and transgenic mice, however, have suggested that in the embryo the insulin receptor (IR) may also be a receptor for IGF-II. In most cells and tissues, IR binds IGF-II with relatively low affinity. The IR is expressed in two isoforms (IR-A and IR-B) differing by 12 amino acids due to the alternative splicing of exon 11. In the present study we found that IR-A but not IR-B bound IGF-II with an affinity close to that of insulin. Moreover, IGF-II bound to IR-A with an affinity equal to that of IGF-II binding to the IGF-I-R. Activation of IR-A by insulin led primarily to metabolic effects, whereas activation of IR-A by IGF-II led primarily to mitogenic effects. These differences in the biological effects of IR-A when activated by either IGF-II or insulin were associated with differential recruitment and activation of intracellular substrates. IR-A was preferentially expressed in fetal cells such as fetal fibroblasts, muscle, liver and kidney and had a relatively increased proportion of isoform A. IR-A expression was also increased in several tumors including those of the breast and colon. These data indicate, therefore, that there are two receptors for IGF-II, both IGF-I-R and IR-A. Further, they suggest that interaction of IGF-II with IR-A may play a role both in fetal growth and cancer biology.
10435587	Expression of the wild-type insulin-like growth factor II receptor gene suppresses growth and causes death in colorectal carcinoma cells.	The insulin-like growth factor II receptor (IGFIIR) has been implicated as a tumor suppressor gene in human malignancy. Frequent mutation, loss of heterozygosity, and microsatellite instability (MSI) directly affecting the IGFIIR gene have been reported in several primary human tumor types. However, to our knowledge, dynamic functional evidence of a growth-suppressive role for IGFIIR has not yet been provided. We identified one MSI-positive colorectal carcinoma cell line, SW48, with monoallelic mutation in IGFIIR identical to that seen in primary colorectal carcinomas. A zinc-inducible construct containing the wild-type IGFIIR cDNA was stably transfected into SW48 cells. Growth rate and apoptosis were compared between zinc-treated, untreated, and untransfected cells. A twofold increase in IGFIIR protein expression was detected after zinc treatment in discrete clonal isolates of transfected SW48 cells. Moreover, zinc induction of exogenous wild-type IGFIIR expression reproducibly decreased growth rate and increased apoptosis. These data prove that wild-type IGFIIR functions as a growth suppressor gene in colorectal cancer cells and provide dynamic in vitro functional support for the hypothesis that IGFIIR is a human growth suppressor gene.
10676665	Down-regulation of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor by antisense RNA can reverse the transformed phenotype of human cervical cancer cell lines.	The insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) plays an essential role in the establishment and maintenance of transformed phenotype, and interference with the IGF-IR pathway by antisense or dominant-negative mutants causes reversal of the transformed phenotype in many rodent and human tumor cell lines. We stably transfected an IGF-IR antisense mRNA expression plasmid into human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative C33a cell line, HPV-16-positive SiHa cell line, and HPV-18-positive HeLa S3 cell line to determine whether the IGF-IR could be a target for cervical cancer cells, especially in the presence of HPV. Approximately 30-80% down-regulation of IGF-IR expression was observed by Western blot in antisense transfected clones. There was a little inhibition in monolayer growth in all cell lines. In C33a cells, wild-type and sense clones formed 92-146 colonies in soft agar after 3 weeks; antisense clones formed <12 colonies. In SiHa cells, wild-type and sense clones formed approximately 60 colonies after 5 weeks; antisense clones formed 0-3 colonies. In HeLa S3 cells, wild-type and sense clones formed 218-291 colonies in soft agar after 2 weeks; antisense clones formed 14-160 colonies. There was a good correlation between IGF-IR down-regulation level and inhibition of transformation in soft agar. Tumorigenesis in nude mice was strongly inhibited in HeLa S3 and SiHa clones transfected with the antisense. These results indicate that down-regulation of IGF-IR by antisense RNA can reverse the transformed phenotype of human cervical cancer cells, even when harboring malignant type HPVs.
11245436	Up-regulation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator by insulin-like growth factor-I depends upon phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase.	Elevated levels of urokinase plasminogen activator-1 (uPA) and the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) are associated with breast cancer recurrence and decreased survival. It is possible that activation of IGF-IR and elevations in uPA are mechanistically linked. Our laboratory recently showed that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) induces uPA protein and mRNA in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. We also found that IGF-IR and uPA were commonly overexpressed in primary breast cancers. In this study, we investigated the signal transduction pathway through which IGF-I regulates uPA. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and p70 kinase were inhibited with LY294002, PD98059, and rapamycin, respectively. Induction of uPA protein by IGF-I was partially inhibited by LY294002 (60% inhibition) or PD98059 (30% inhibition) but not by rapamycin. The production of uPA protein induced by IGF-I was blocked up to 90% by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A. Furthermore, herbimycin A suppressed the phosphorylation of AKT and Erk1/2. Next, we tested the impact of the signal transduction inhibitors on uPA gene expression. Both LY294002 and PD98059 were required to completely inhibit uPA mRNA expression, whereas each drug alone resulted in approximately 50% reduction in uPA expression. Next, using a minimal uPA-luciferase promoter construct containing the binding sites for the AP-1 and Ets transcription factors, we observed that IGF-I stimulated the uPA promoter via these sites. Furthermore, both Ly294002 and PD98059 were necessary to block IGF-I-stimulated uPA-Luc activity. In summary, we conclude that IGF-I requires both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-dependent pathways to optimally induce uPA expression. These findings suggest that the development of drugs targeting these pathways may benefit breast cancer patients at a high risk of recurrence, such as those who have primary tumors overexpressing IGF-IR and uPA.
11376126	Insulin-like growth factor 1 and oestradiol promote cell proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells: new insights into their synergistic effects.	In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and the oestrogen receptor (ER) are coexpressed and the two signalling systems are engaged in a crosstalk that results in synergistic growth. However, coupling between the signalling cascades is poorly understood. Oestradiol enhances IGF-1R signalling by inducing the expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), a substrate of the IGF-1R. Oestradiol induced expression of IRS-1 results in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 after IGF-1 stimulation, followed by enhanced mitogen activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3' kinase, and Akt activation. Oestradiol can also potentiate the effect of IGF-1 on the expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E, and on the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (RB). These effects are greatly diminished in SX13 cells, which exhibit a 50% reduction in IGF-1R expression but few functional IGF-1Rs at the surface. Oestradiol and IGF-1 regulate the expression of two cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors, p21 and p27, differently. Whereas IGF-1 increases p21 expression and reduces p27 expression, oestradiol has no effect on p21. In summary, in MCF-7 cells, oestrogen potentiates the effect of IGF-1 on IGF-1R signalling and its effects on certain cell cycle components.
11445579	A PDZ domain protein interacts with the C-terminal tail of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor but not with the insulin receptor.	In this study, we report on the isolation of a PDZ domain protein, here designated as IIP-1, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor-interacting protein-1, which binds to the IGF-1 receptor, but not to the related insulin receptor, and which is involved in the regulation of cell motility. The interaction between the IGF-1 receptor and IIP-1 as well as a splice variant IIP-1/p26 was demonstrated in the yeast two-hybrid system. Using co-precipitation experiments, we confirmed the interaction in transfected cells as well as in vitro. Analysis of deletion mutants indicates that the PDZ domain of IIP-1 mediates interaction with the C-terminal tail of the IGF-1 receptor (serine-threonine-cysteine). This finding demonstrates that the C terminus of the IGF-1 receptor acts as novel PDZ domain binding site. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed an overlapping localization of IIP-1 and the IGF-1 receptor in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. A functional connection between IIP-1 and the IGF-1 receptor is further supported by the finding that the level of expression of IIP-1 and the IGF-1 receptor strongly correlates in different normal and cancer cells. Furthermore, overexpression of IIP-1 resulted in an attenuation of migration of MCF-7 cells, which is one of the biological activities mediated by the IGF-1 signaling system.
12543777	Insulin-like growth factor II receptor gene-167 genotype increases the risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma in humans.	Our purpose was to evaluate inherited short tandem repeat polymorphisms of the insulin-like growth factor II receptor gene (IGF2R) in oral cancer risk. The 197 individuals that consented to participate in a hospital-based, case-control study were interviewed with a structured questionnaire and provided blood and saliva. DNA was extracted for genotyping using a PCR-based method. Odds ratios were calculated using multivariate logistic regression. Subjects carrying the heterozygous 167-bp IGF2R genotype had a 2.7-fold higher risk of oral cancer compared with subjects with other genotypes (odds ratio = 2.7, 95% confidence interval: 1.16-6.48), controlling for major confounders. Our results suggest that genetic variation of IGF2R may influence significantly the risk of oral cancer.
8546673	Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase acts at an intracellular membrane site to enhance GLUT4 exocytosis in 3T3-L1 cells.	Glucose transporters (GLUTs) are continuously recycled in 3T3-L1 cells and so insulin, through its action on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), could potentially alter the distribution of these transporters by enhancing retention in the plasma membrane or acting intracellularly to increase exocytosis, either by stimulating a budding or a docking and fusion process. To examine the site of involvement of PI 3-kinase in the glucose transporter recycling pathway, we have determined the kinetics of recycling under conditions in which the PI 3-kinase activity is inhibited by wortmannin. Wortmannin addition to fully insulin-stimulated cells induces a net reduction of glucose transport activity with a time course that is consistent with a major effect on the return of internalized transporters to the plasma membrane. The exocytosis of GLUT1 and GLUT4 is reduced to very low levels in wortmannin-treated cells (approximately 0.009 min-1), but the endocytosis of these isoforms is not markedly perturbed and the rate constants are approx. 10-fold higher than for exocytosis (0.099 and 0.165 min-1, respectively). The slow reduction in basal activity following treatment with wortmannin is consistent with a wortmannin effect on constitutive recycling as well as insulin-regulated exocytosis. PI 3-kinase activity that is precipitated by anti-phosphotyrosine, anti(-)[insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1)] and anti-alpha-p85 antibodies show the same level of insulin-stimulated activity, approximately 0.5 pmol/20 min per dish of 3T3-L1 cells. Since the activities precipitated by all three antibodies are similar, it seems unlikely that a second insulin receptor substrate, IRS2, contributes significantly to the insulin signalling observed in 3T3-L1 cells. To examine whether insulin targets PI 3-kinase to intracellular membranes we have carried out subcellular fractionation studies. These suggest that nearly all the insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity is located on intracellular, low-density, membranes. In addition, the association of PI 3-kinase with IRS1 appears to partially deplete the cytoplasm of alpha-p85-precipitatable activity, suggesting that IRS1 may redistribute PI 3-kinase from the cytoplasm to the low-density microsome membranes. Taken together, the trafficking kinetic and PI 3-kinase distribution studies suggest an intracellular membrane site of action of the enzyme in enhancing glucose transporter exocytosis.
9815544	Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 and insulin receptor substrate-1 in breast cancer: correlation with clinical parameters and disease-free survival.	Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) interact with specific cell surface receptors to mediate cell growth. Intracellular effects of the IGFs are mediated by activation of secondary messenger molecules. One of these proteins, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), is phosphorylated after type I IGF receptor activation and has a major role in IGF signaling. Receptor activation also is influenced by high-affinity IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs). In serum, IGFBP-3 is the predominant species. The role of IGFBP-3 in the regulation of breast cancer cell growth is unclear; both growth inhibition and stimulation have been documented in tissue culture systems. To investigate the influence of IGFBP-3 and IRS-1 in breast cancer, we measured levels of these proteins by ELISA and immunoblotting in 195 node-negative primary human breast cancers and compared their levels with known prognostic factors and disease-free survival (DFS). IGFBP-3 levels correlated positively with tumor size (r = 0.27, P < 0.0001) and negatively with estrogen receptor (r = -0.35, P < 0. 0001) and progesterone receptor (r = -0.16, P = 0.021). In contrast, IRS-1 did not correlate with prognostic factors, but higher levels of IRS-1 predicted worse DFS for the subset of patients with tumors </=2 cm (P = 0.04), and for patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors, there was a trend toward worse DFS (P = 0.06). These results suggest that higher tumor levels of IGFBP-3 are associated with worse features in breast cancer. However, IGFBP-3 was not an independent prognostic factor. In contrast, high levels of IRS-1 in the tumors predicted a higher incidence of recurrence, suggesting that IRS-1-mediated signaling in breast tumors may be involved in the growth regulation of breast cancer.
9929781	Effects of insulin deficiency on lipoproteins and their hepatic receptors in Rico rats.	The present study was designed to examine the effect of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes on the plasma lipoprotein profile and hepatic expression of the LDL receptor and HDL binding protein (HB2) in hypercholesterolemic Rico rats. The plasma level of HDL1 (density range 1.040-1.063), which is particularly high in this rat strain, decreased (-25%) 28 d after STZ administration (50 mg/kg). In contrast, the treatment increased (+54%) the plasma concentration of HDL2 (density range 1.063-1.210). These variations in the lipoprotein concentrations were associated with inverse changes in the hepatic protein levels of the LDL receptor (+118%) and HB2 (-46%). These results suggest that the hepatic expression of HB2, a putative HDL receptor, can influence the plasma level of apo Al-rich HDL as has already been shown for the LDL receptor for apo B/E containing lipoproteins.
10720068	The intracellular mechanism of insulin resistance in pancreatic cancer patients.	The diabetes that frequently occurs in pancreatic cancer patients is characterized by profound peripheral insulin resistance. The intracellular mechanism of this insulin resistance was investigated in skeletal muscle biopsies from pancreatic cancer patients with or without diabetes and control subjects. Insulin receptor (IR) binding, tyrosine kinase activity, IR messenger RNA (mRNA), IR substrate-1 content, GLUT-4, and GLUT-4 mRNA content were all normal in pancreatic cancer patients. In contrast, multiple defects in glycogen synthesis were found in pancreatic cancer patients, especially in those with diabetes. Glycogen synthase I activity, total activity, and mRNA levels were significantly decreased in pancreatic cancer patients compared with controls. The fractional velocity of glycogen synthase was decreased only in the diabetic pancreatic cancer group. Glycogen phosphorylase a and b activities were increased in diabetic pancreatic cancer patients, but glycogen phosphorylase mRNA levels were not significantly different. The insulin resistance associated with pancreatic cancer is associated with a post-IR defect, which impairs skeletal muscle glycogen synthesis and glycogen storage.
10851068	IGF-I receptor signaling in a prostatic cancer cell line with a PTEN mutation.	LNCaP prostatic cancer cells are characterized by having a PTEN mutation, low levels of type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) and no IRS-1, one of the major substrates of the IGF-IR. The absence of IRS-1, an activator of PI3-kinase, is compensated in these cells by the mutation in PTEN, an inhibitor of PI3-kinase. However, IGF-IR signaling in the absence of IRS-1 can cause cell differentiation and growth arrest. We hypothesized that these three characteristics may not be unrelated, specifically that, together, they may favor the metastatic spread of prostatic cancer cells without decreasing their growth potential. In support of this hypothesis, we report here that: (1) IRS-1 expression increases cell adhesion and decreases cell motility; (2) over-expression of the IGF-IR, in the absence of IRS-1, causes growth arrest and (3) a combination of IGF-IR and IRS-1 restores the transformed phenotype of LNCaP cells. These findings suggest a mechanism by which prostatic cancer cells can achieve metastatic potential without interfering with their growth potential. Oncogene (2000).
11040093	Mutation analysis in a small cohort of New Zealand patients originating from the United Kingdom demonstrates genetic heterogeneity in familial hypercholesterolemia.	Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 (FDB) are relatively common lipid disorders caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and apolipoprotein B (apo B) genes, respectively. Molecular analysis at these loci was performed in eight New Zealand subjects with clinical features of heterozygous FH. Utilization of an in vitro lymphocyte receptor assay demonstrated normal receptor function in four patients, three of whom screened positive for the founder-type apo B mutation, R3500Q, causing FDB. Four patients with reduced LDLR function, consistent with heterozygous FH, revealed three previously documented mutations in exons 3 (W66X), 6 (C292Y) and 7 (G322S) of the LDLR gene and, a novel 2-bp deletion (TC or CT) after nucleotide 1204 (or 1205) in exon 9. The remaining patient was found to be FH/FDB negative after extensive mutation screening using both denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and heteroduplex-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Haplotype analysis at the LDLR and apo B loci finally excluded the likelihood that mutations in these two genes underlie the FH phenotype in the molecularly uncharacterized New Zealand family originating from the United Kingdom. This family represents a valuable source of material for future genetic dissection of autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH), shown to be a heterogeneous disease through molecular analysis.
11043572	Tumor necrosis factor alpha-mediated insulin resistance, but not dedifferentiation, is abrogated by MEK1/2 inhibitors in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.	Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) has been implicated as a contributing mediator of insulin resistance observed in pathophysiological conditions such as obesity, cancer-induced cachexia, and bacterial infections. Previous studies have demonstrated that TNFalpha confers insulin resistance by promoting phosphorylation of serine residues on insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), thereby diminishing subsequent insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. However, little is known about which signaling molecules are involved in this process in adipocytes and about the temporal sequence of events that ultimately leads to TNFalpha-stimulated IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. In this study, we demonstrate that specific inhibitors of the MAP kinase kinase (MEK)1/2-p42/44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway restore insulin signaling to normal levels despite the presence of TNFalpha. Additional experiments show that MEK1/2 activity is required for TNFalpha-induced IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, thereby suggesting a mechanism by which these inhibitors restore insulin signaling. We observe that TNFalpha requires 2.5-4 h to markedly reduce insulin-triggered tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Although TNFalpha activates p42/44 MAP kinase, maximal stimulation is observed within 10-30 min. To our surprise, p42/44 activity returns to basal levels well before IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and insulin resistance are observed. These activation kinetics suggest a mechanism of p42/44 action more complicated than a direct phosphorylation of IRS-1 triggered by the early spike of TNFalpha-induced p42/44 activity. Chronic TNFalpha treatment (>> 72 h) causes adipocyte dedifferentiation, as evidenced by the loss of triglycerides and down-regulation of adipocyte-specific markers. We observe that this longer term TNFalpha-mediated dedifferentiation effect utilizes alternative, p42/44 MAP kinase-independent intracellular pathways. This study suggests that TNFalpha-mediated insulin resistance, but not adipocyte dedifferentiation, is mediated by the MEK1/2-p42/44 MAP kinase pathway.
11723502	[Neoplasm mortality in women in reproductive age (15 to 49 years) in the State of São Paulo, Brazil, from 1991 to 1995].	"OBJECTIVE: To describe the mortality owing to neoplasms in women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years) in the State of São Paulo, Brazil, from 1991 to 1995. METHODS: A list of all deaths and their underlying causes, coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, 9 th revision, and estimates of the female population according to age groups were provided by the SEADE Foundation. Specific coefficients for 100 thousand women for each year as well as the medians of the coefficients related to 5 years, and the percentage of underlying causes of death by subgroups were calculated. RESULTS: In young women (15 to 29 years) highest rates were found for the subgroup ""Malignant neoplasm of lymphatic and hematopoiethic tissues"", followed by the subgroup ""Malignant neoplasm of bones, connective tissue, skin and breast"". In women aged 30 to 49 years, the leading underlying causes of death were those included in the last subgroup, followed by the subgroups ""Malignant neoplasm of genitourinary organs"", ""Malignant neoplasm of digestive organs and peritoneum"", and ""Malignant neoplasm of lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues"". The highest specific rates of underlying causes of death for women aged 15-29 were myeloid and lymphoid leukemias, and for women aged 30-49 were in decreasing rank,"" breast cancer""; ""uterine cervix cancer"" and ""not specified uterine part cancer""; ""stomach cancer""; ""tracheal, bronchial and lung cancer"" and ""ovarian and other uterine annexes"". CONCLUSION: Preventive measures to eliminate or lower the risk factors exposure and to promote early diagnosis and prompt treatment of these neoplasms should be enhanced in order to avoid possible future pregnancy complications and to prolong survival of women of reproductive age."
11895872	A polymorphism in the CYP17 gene and risk of prostate cancer.	Steroid hormones are important in the etiology and progression of prostate cancer, and expression of genes involved in hormone production may alter susceptibility. One such gene is CYP17, which encodes the cytochrome P450c17a enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of testosterone. A T to C transition (A2 allele) in the 5' promoter region of the gene is hypothesized to increase the rate of gene transcription, increase androgen production, and thereby increase risk of prostate cancer. To test this hypothesis, germ-line DNA samples from a large population-based study of incident prostate cancer cases (n = 590) and controls (n = 538) of similar age without the disease were genotyped. The frequency of the A2 allele was similar in cases and controls. Compared with men with the A1/A1 genotype, the adjusted odds ratio was 0.81 for the A1/A2 and 0.87 for the A2/A2 genotype. Risk estimates did not vary substantially by age or race. However, stratification by family history of prostate cancer revealed that among white men with an affected first-degree relative, homozygotes for the A2 allele had a significant elevation in risk (odds ratio = 19.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.2-157.4) compared with men who were homozygous for the A1 allele (interaction P = 0.0005). These results suggest that the CYP17 A2/A2 genotype predicts susceptibility to prostate cancer in white men with a family history of the disease. It is also possible that CYP17 interacts with other genes that influence risk of familial prostate cancer.
14534541	Progesterone crosstalks with insulin-like growth factor signaling in breast cancer cells via induction of insulin receptor substrate-2.	Both progesterone and the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are critically involved in mammary gland development and also in breast cancer progression. However, how the progesterone and IGF signaling pathways interact with each other to regulate breast cancer cell growth remains unresolved. In this study, we investigated progesterone regulation of IGF signaling components in breast cancer cells. We found that insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) levels were markedly induced by progesterone and the synthetic progestin R5020 in MCF-7 and other progesterone receptor (PR) positive breast cancer cell lines, whereas IRS-1 and the IGF-I receptor were not induced. The antiprogestin RU486 blocked the R5020 effect on IRS-2 expression. Ectopic expression of either PR-A or PR-B in C4-12 breast cancer cells (estrogen receptor and PR negative) showed that progestin upregulation of IRS-2 was mediated specifically by PR-B. The IRS-2 induction by R5020 occurred via an increase of IRS-2 mRNA levels. Furthermore, progestin treatment prior to IGF-I stimulation resulted in higher tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-2 levels, increased binding of IRS-2 to Grb-2 and the PI3K regulatory subunit p85, and correspondingly enhanced ERK and Akt activation, as compared with IGF-I-only conditions. Taken together, our data suggest that IRS-2 may play an important role in crosstalk between progesterone and the IGFs in breast cancer cells.
8145772	Insulin-resistant MDA-MB231 human breast cancer cells contain a tyrosine kinase inhibiting activity.	In most human breast cancer cell lines, insulin, via its own receptor, stimulates cell growth. However, in MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells, insulin at concentration as high as 100 nM has no effect on cell growth, although insulin receptors (IRs) are overexpressed in these cells (29.1 ng IR/10(6) cells), and IR binding characteristics are similar to other breast cancer cell lines. IR tyrosine kinase activity is markedly reduced both in intact MDA-MB231 cells and in isolated IRs purified on a wheat germ agglutinin affinity column. MDA-MB231 cells contain a factor that inhibits both basal and insulin-stimulated IR tyrosine kinase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. This inhibitory activity copurifies with the IR on insulin-Sepharose affinity chromatography and is also effective against the tyrosine kinase activity of the IR-related insulin-like growth factor-I receptor and the oncoprotein v-abl but is ineffective against c-src tyrosine kinase activity. It is possible, therefore, that this tyrosine kinase inhibitor plays a role in regulating the mitogenic potential of the IR in some human breast cancers.
8665514	Repression of the insulin receptor promoter by the tumor suppressor gene product p53: a possible mechanism for receptor overexpression in breast cancer.	There is strong evidence to suggest that insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I may be important for tumor growth. Both the insulin and IGF-I receptors (IGF-IR) are overexpressed in breast cancer, and antibody blockade of the IGF-IR inhibits the growth of some breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, expression of an insulin receptor (IR) in a normal mammary epithelia] cell line causes insulin-dependent transformation. Functional inactivation of p53 is also very frequent in many tumors. In this paper, we investigated whether inactivation of p53 might be involved in the overexpression of the IR in malignancy, specifically breast cancer. We demonstrate a positive correlation between IR and IGF-IR levels and p53 overexpression in primary human breast malignancies. To examine possible mechanisms by which p53 may regulate IR gene expression, we show that p53 can repress the IR promoter and that a dominant-negative p53 (248Q) can de-repress the promoter in cells containing normal p53. The p53 effect was shown to be mediated by C/EBP and Sp1 transcription factors. We also documented that p53-null mice had elevated levels of Sp1, but not C/EBPalpha, and that insulin binding to liver extracts was increased compared to wild-type controls. These results suggest that p53 inactivation may lead to an up-regulation of genes, such as the IR, that are dependent on these transcription factors.
8883958	Expression of insulin receptor-related receptor in the rat brain examined by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.	Insulin receptor-related receptor (IRR) is a member of the insulin receptor family. However, its endogenous ligand and physiological roles are unknown. To elucidate the physiological roles of IRR, an orphan receptor, in the brain, we examined its expression at mRNA and protein levels in the brain by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The expression of IRR mRNA in the brain was highly restricted to the forebrain including the nucleus of the diagonal band, medial septal nucleus, ventral pallidum, accumbens nucleus and caudate putamen, and the brainstem including the prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, medial vestibular nucleus, gigantocell reticular nucleus, paragigantocellular nucleus and ventral cochlear nucleus. Most IRR mRNA-positive cells in the forebrain but not in the brainstem were cholinergic neurons. However, most IRR mRNA in the forebrain and brainstem was coexpressed with that of trkA, a high-affinity receptor for nerve growth factor. IRR-immunoreactive cell bodies were also detected in the forebrain and brainstem. The pattern of IRR immunoreactivity was similar to that of IRR mRNA. Its restricted pattern indicates that IRR plays unique roles in the brain, in contrast to insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I receptors, other members of the insulin receptor family, which are widely expressed in the brain.
9222417	Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity in colon carcinoma.	Colon carcinoma is the most common tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. According to some investigators, insulin, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) man be involved in the neoplastic proliferation. Insulin-binding and receptor tyrosine kinase activity were investigated in colon carcinomas and in normal colons. The insulin receptor concentration, as shown by binding assays, was 17.4 +/- 4.3 fmol/micrograms in normal colon and 29.69 +/- 9.4 fmol/micrograms in colon carcinoma. Nevertheless, the insulin affinity of the receptor was similar in both groups (Kd identical to 1 nM). Both normal and neoplastic colon showed phosphorylation of the insulin receptor. The electrophoretic migration of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptors purified from colon carcinomas was similar to that of normal colon and both tissues demonstrated an insulin-dependent autophosphorylation. The receptor tyrosine kinase activity was measured by the incorporation of [gamma 32P]ATP into the beta-subunit. The basal and the insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activities were significantly higher in colon carcinomas compared to normal colon tissues (2.2 and 1.6 times, respectively). Understanding the metabolism of neoplastic cells may contribute to the development of prevention strategies as well as new therapies. It is now necessary to study other steps of the insulin signal transduction pathway, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 phosphorylation.
9342439	The insulin receptor content is increased in breast cancers initiated by three different oncogenes in transgenic mice.	The Insulin Receptor (IR) is a potential oncogene for mammary epithelial cells since its content is increased in most human breast cancer specimens, and both ligand-dependent malignant transformation and ligand-dependent enhanced growth occurs in cultured breast cells overexpressing the IR. To better understand whether the IR plays a role in mammary carcinogenesis which is independent of other initiation factors, we measured IR content in transgenic mouse models of breast cancer induced by 3 known oncogenes (Wnt-1, Neu, and Ret). Insulin receptor content was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay. In normal mammary gland tissues IR content was 14.6 +/- 1.4 ng/mg of protein (mean +/- SEM, n = 6). In the 3 cancers IR content was elevated (Neu = 36.1 +/- 4.6, n = 8, p < 0.002; Wnt-1 = 38.3 +/- 2.6, n = 13, p < 0.001; and Ret = 53.6 +/- 7.1, n = 7, p < 0.001). These data indicate that IR overexpression, in addition to being a potential oncogene, is increased in mouse tumors initiated by other oncogenes, and therefore may also play a supportive role in the growth of breast cancers.
9850076	Inhibition of insulin-like growth factor I receptor expression in neuroblastoma cells induces the regression of established tumors in mice.	Several lines of evidence now indicate that type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) function may be particularly important in the pathogenesis of the pediatric cancer neuroblastoma. Modulating the expression of specific genes involved in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis could provide a much needed alternative treatment strategy for poor prognosis disease. We now report construction of an antisense expression vector to the IGF1R that markedly reduces cellular IGF1R levels and inhibits the proliferation and clonogenicity of neuroblastoma cells in vitro but not that of IGF1R null cells. This antitumor activity is associated with the induction of apoptotic cell death in transfected cells, as measured by annexin V staining and flow cytometry. Direct injection of this vector into established tumors growing in syngeneic mice results in a marked inhibition of tumor growth with complete and durable tumor regression in one-half of the animals. This effect appears to be immunologically mediated in that vector injection of neuroblastoma tumors growing in severe combined immunodeficiency mice results in only modest delay of tumor growth. Our results suggest that inhibition of IGF1R expression by direct intratumoral delivery of an antisense construct could provide a novel therapeutic approach in the management of poor prognosis neuroblastoma.
11788654	A novel autocrine loop involving IGF-II and the insulin receptor isoform-A stimulates growth of thyroid cancer.	The insulin receptor (IR) occurs in two isoforms (IR-A and IR-B) resulting from alternative splicing of exon 11 of the gene. The IR-A isoform is predominantly expressed in fetal tissues and malignant cells and binds IGF-II with high affinity. We previously observed that IRs are overexpressed in thyroid cancer cells; now we evaluated whether these cells preferentially express IR-A and produce IGF-II, which would activate a growth-promoting autocrine loop. The IR content ranged 6.0-52.6 ng/100 microg cell membrane protein in thyroid cancer primary cultures (n = 8) and permanent cell lines (n = 6) vs. 1.2-1.7 in normal thyroid cells (n = 11 primary cultures; P < 0.0001). IR-A isoform relative abundance ranged from 36-79% in cancer cells (with the highest values in undifferentiated cancers) vs. 27-39% in normal cells. Similar results were obtained in normal vs. cancer thyroid tissue specimens. IGF-II caused IR autophosphorylation with an ED(50) of 1.5-40.0 nM in cancer cells vs. more than 100 nM in normal cells; IGF-II affinity correlated with the relative abundance of IR-A (r = 0.628; P < 0.0001). IGF-II was expressed in all cancer cells, highly expressed in anaplastic cells, and less expressed in normal cells. In conclusion, malignant thyrocytes, especially when poorly differentiated, produce IGF-II and overexpress IR, predominantly as IGF-II-sensitive isoform A. A growth-promoting autocrine loop is activated, therefore, and may affect thyroid cancer biology.
11983706	Glucose regulates insulin mitogenic effect by modulating SHP-2 activation and localization in JAr cells.	The glucose effect on cell growth has been investigated in the JAr human choriocarcinoma cells. When JAr cells were cultured in the presence of 6 mm glucose (LG), proliferation and thymidine incorporation were induced by serum, epidermal growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor 1 but not by insulin. In contrast, at 25 mm glucose (HG), proliferation and thymidine incorporation were stimulated by insulin, serum, epidermal growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor 1 to a comparable extent, whereas basal levels were 25% lower than those in LG. HG culturing also enhanced insulin-stimulated insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) tyrosine phosphorylations while decreasing basal phosphorylations. These actions of glucose were accompanied by an increase in cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity. The activity of SHP-2 in HG-treated JAr cells was 400% of that measured in LG-treated cells. SHP-2 co-precipitation with IRS1 was also increased in HG-treated cells. SHP-2 was mainly cytosolic in LG-treated cells. However, HG culturing largely redistributed SHP-2 to the internal membrane compartment, where tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 predominantly localizes. Further exposure to insulin rescued SHP-2 cytosolic localization, thereby preventing its interaction with IRS1. Antisense inhibition of SHP-2 reverted the effect of HG on basal and insulin-stimulated insulin receptor and IRS1 phosphorylation as well as that on thymidine incorporation. Thus, in JAr cells, glucose modulates insulin mitogenic action by modulating SHP-2 activity and intracellular localization.
12193537	Functional insulin receptors on human epithelial ovarian carcinoma cells: implications for IGF-II mitogenic signaling.	The insulin receptor mediates a proliferative response in certain transformed cells, but little is known about its function in ovarian cancer. We used human epithelial ovarian carcinoma cell lines and lifespan-extended normal ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cells to examine (125)I-insulin binding and mitogenic responses to insulin. All cancer cell and OSE cultures specifically bound (125)I-insulin. Except for OV202, the carcinoma lines had elevated insulin binding compared with OSE cells. All carcinoma lines except OV202 expressed insulin receptor as detected by flow cytometry and increased (3)H-thymidine incorporation or cell number in response to 0.1-10 nM insulin. Interestingly, similar concentrations of IGF-II also induced proliferation of the insulin-responsive cancer cell lines and displaced (125)I-insulin binding. Direct binding of (125)I-IGF-II to the insulin receptor was visualized by cross-linking and immunoprecipitation. Binding of IGF-II to the insulin receptor and a proliferative effect of insulin suggest the presence of insulin receptor isoform A. Real-time PCR analyses confirm that insulin receptor isoform A expression predominates over isoform B expression in the ovarian carcinoma cell lines. This report suggests that the insulin receptor may play a role in the regulation of ovarian cancer cell growth.
14520693	Increased expression of the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-II receptor in breast cancer cells alters tumorigenic properties in vitro and in vivo.	The mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-II receptor (M6P/IGF-IIR) is thought to act as a suppressor of tumor growth by binding the mitogenic peptide IGF-II and modulating its extracellular levels via degradation. This receptor has been found to be absent or nonfunctional in a high proportion of breast tumors as a result of LOH and mutation of the gene. In our study, we have examined the effect of increasing expression of M6P/IGF-IIR on breast cancer cell tumorigenicity. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells stably transfected with M6P/IGF-IIR cDNA exhibited not only a greatly reduced ability to form tumors but also a markedly reduced growth rate in nude mice. In vitro, increased M6P/IGF-IIR expression resulted in 2-fold reduced uptake of IGF-II and was associated with reduced cellular invasiness and motility. Cells with increased M6P/IGF-IIR expression exhibited reduced phosphorylation of IGF-I receptor and p44/42 MAPK compared to vector transfectants, or wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells. These results therefore suggest that M6P/IGF-IIR levels can modulate breast cancer cell tumorigenicity by a mechanism that may involve altered IGF-I receptor signaling.
7694792	Sensitivity of human KB cells expressing platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor to pyrimidine antimetabolites.	Thymidine phosphorylase (dThdPase) is an enzyme involved in pyrimidine nucleoside metabolism. However, little is known about its physiological functions. We previously purified dThdPase from human placenta, isolated a complementary DNA clone for this enzyme, and sequenced it. There was complete sequence identity between 120 amino acids of human dThdPase and the sequence of platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF). Human KB epidermal carcinoma cells transfected with platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor complementary DNA expressed a 55-kDa protein that was detected with anti-dThdPase antibody and the cell lysate had dThdPase activity. The sensitivity of transfected cells to the antimetabolites was compared with that of untransfected KB cells. The sensitivity of the transfected cells to Doxifluridine (5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine) was higher than that of untransfected KB cells. Transfected cells were also more sensitive to Tegafur than untransfected KB cells. These results demonstrate that dThdPase is involved in the activation of these anticancer agents. Since many cancer tissues contain high dThdPase activity compared with normal tissues, these transfected and untransfected KB cells are useful for studying the role of dThdPase in the activation of pyrimidine antimetabolites and also in angiogenesis.
7883115	Evidence for a major gene affecting postchallenge insulin levels in Mexican-Americans.	Hyperinsulinemia, which is considered a hallmark of insulin resistance, precedes the development of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Results of family and twin studies have shown that heredity influences insulin resistance and insulin levels. In Caucasian families ascertained through two or more NIDDM siblings, it has been reported that single genes with large effects, i.e., major genes, influence both fasting and 1-h postchallenge insulin levels. To determine whether a major gene affects 2-h postchallenge insulin levels in Mexican-Americans, we conducted segregation analyses using data collected on 527 pedigreed individuals from 27 families in San Antonio, TX. Probands for the families were randomly ascertained and all first-, second-, and third-degree relatives aged 16 years and older were invited to participate. Subjects received a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test, and diabetes was diagnosed according to World Health Organization criteria. We found that an autosomal dominant major gene best described the inheritance of 2-h insulin levels (ln-transformed) in these 27 families. Of the individuals in the population, 17% were homozygous for the 2-h low-insulin allele (back-transformed mean = 125 pmol/l) and 83% were heterozygous or homozygous for the 2-h high-insulin allele (back-transformed mean = 406 pmol/l). This major gene accounted for 31% of the variance in ln(2-h insulin levels) in this population. Using quantitative trait linkage analyses, we excluded tight linkage between this gene affecting 2-h insulin levels and three candidate loci for insulin levels: the insulin receptor gene, the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene, and the glucokinase gene.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
9205064	Tamoxifen interferes with the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) signaling pathway in breast cancer cells.	The insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) is involved in the control of breast cancer cell growth. The cytostatic activity of tamoxifen (Tam), a nonsteroidal antiestrogen, is partially mediated through interference with IGF-I-R-dependent proliferation, yet the effects of Tam on IGF-IR intracellular signaling have never been elucidated. Consequently, we investigated how Tam modifies the IGF-IR signaling pathway in estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells and in MCF-7-derived clones overexpressing either the IGF-IR (MCF-7/IGF-IR cells) or its major substrate, IRS-1 (MCF-7/IRS-1 cells). MCF-7/IGF-IR and MCF-7/IRS-1 cells exhibit greatly reduced estrogen growth requirements but retain estrogen receptors and express sensitivity to antiestrogens comparable to that in the parental cells. In all tested cell lines, regardless of the amplification of IGF signaling, a 4-day treatment with 10 nM Tam produced a similar cytostatic effect. In MCF-7 and MCF-7/IGF-IR cells, growth inhibition by Tam was associated with the reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-IR in the presence of IGF-I; however, the basal level of the IGF-IR remained unaffected. Moreover, Tam inhibited both basal and IGF-I-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which was accompanied by down-regulation of IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase activity and reduced IRS-1/growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) binding. In contrast, under the same treatment, tyrosine phosphorylation of Src-homology/collagen proteins (SHC; another substrate of the IGF-IR) and SHC/GRB2 binding were elevated. The protein levels of the IGF-IR and IRS-1 were not modified by Tam, whereas SHC protein expression was either not affected or moderately decreased by the treatment. In summary, this work provides the first evidence that in MCF-7 cells, cytostatic effects of Tam are associated with the modulation of IGF-IR signaling, specifically with: (a) down-regulation of IGF-I-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-IR; (b) inhibition of IRS-1/phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase signaling; and (c) up-regulation of SHC tyrosine phosphorylation and increased SHC/GRB2 binding. It is hypothesized that dephosphorylation of IRS-1 could be a major contributing factor in Tam cytostatic activity.
9267840	The scope of gene therapy in humans: scientific, safety and ethical considerations.	Gene therapy entails the introduction of specific, functional genes into cells for therapeutic or preventive purposes. Therapeutic genes may be introduced into cells in vitro (and the treated cells then introduced into the patient) or directly in vivo. Gene therapy may be used for several purposes including: (a) Gene replacement in genetic diseases; (b) Destroying malignant cells in neoplastic diseases; (c) Modifying immune responses; (d) Providing trophic molecules; (e) Immunisation against infectious diseases. In designing gene therapy strategies the following major items need to be investigated and optimised: (1) Relevant biological characteristics of the treatable cells and tissues; (2) Gene vectors (viral or non-viral); (3) The gene expression cassette (promoter+cDNA+poly A signal); (4) The safest and most effective route of administration; (5) Longevity of the transgene expression. Before human trials for gene therapy can commence for a given disease, extensive preclinical studies are to be carried out in an appropriate experimental models to assure the feasibility, safety and efficiency of the enterprise. For each disease or application, the risk/benefit ratio must be determined. Permission by regulatory agencies, institutional review boards (IRB) and thorough informed consent are essential. Although gene therapy holds great promise for many human diseases, it is still too early to predict the extent and timetable of its successful implementation in individual diseases.
11212254	AKT activation up-regulates insulin-like growth factor I receptor expression and promotes invasiveness of human pancreatic cancer cells.	Insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) is frequently overexpressed in several types of human malignancy and is associated with invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. Recently, IGF-IR expression was reported to be up-regulated in the human pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 when cells were stably transfected with active Src. The downstream targets of Src that lead to the up-regulation of IGF-IR expression were previously unknown. We demonstrate here that AKT regulates IGF-IR expression in PANC-1 and AsPC-1 cells. Cells transfected with active Src exhibited significantly more IGF-IR protein compared with vector-transfected cells. Overexpression of wild-type or constitutively active AKT (i.e., AKT1 or AKT2) also resulted in elevated IGF-IR expression. IGF-IR protein levels were higher in cells transfected with constitutively active AKT than in cells transfected with active Src. In vitro kinase assays showed that AKT kinases are activated by active Src and inhibited by dominant negative Src or the tumor suppressor PTEN. Furthermore, AKT-induced IGF-IR expression was down-regulated by dominant-negative Src or PTEN. In addition, cells transfected with activated AKT in the presence of IGF-I were shown to have enhanced invasiveness compared with control cells. These data provide evidence for a link between AKT signaling and the regulation of IGF-IR expression and demonstrate that active AKT promotes the invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells through the up-regulation of IGF-IR expression.
11402025	Inhibition of proprotein convertases is associated with loss of growth and tumorigenicity of HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells: importance of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor processing in IGF-1-mediated functions.	Proprotein convertases (PCs) of the subtilisin/kexin family are responsible for the activation of prohormones, protrophic factors, and their receptors. We sought to determine whether loss of PC-mediated activities might affect the malignant phenotypes of cancer cells. Stable transfectants of alpha(1)-antitrypsin Portland (alpha(1)-PDX) cDNA, coding for a potent PC inhibitor, were analyzed in model HT-29 cells (HT-29/PDX) and in other cell lines. Expression of alpha(1)-PDX resulted in a proinsulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (pro-IGF-1R) processing blockade, hence inhibiting the ability of exogenous IGF-1 to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of its beta-subunit and insulin-related substrate-1. Coexpression of IGF-1R with four different PCs or the novel convertase SKI-1 in the furin-defective LoVo-C5 cells demonstrated that pro-IGF-1R ( approximately 200 kDa) cleavage into IGF-1R (beta-subunit, approximately 105 kDa) can be achieved by furin and PC5A, but not by PACE4, PC7, or SKI-1. Expression of alpha(1)-PDX resulted in reduction of DNA synthesis and in anchorage-independent growth. Following serum deprivation, the alpha(1)-PDX transfectants exhibited an enhanced apoptotic phenotype and were insensitive to IGF-1-mediated [(3)H]thymidine incorporation and protection against apoptosis. These cells showed reduced invasiveness that paralleled decreased mRNA levels of urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its receptor, tissue-type plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Comparative subcutaneous inoculation of cells in nude mice revealed that animals injected with HT-29/PDX cells exhibited delayed and lower incidence of tumor development as well as reduced tumor size. Immunohistochemical analysis of CD31 antigen expression, a marker of endothelial cells, revealed reduced HT-29/PDX tumor vascularization. These findings indicate that PCs actively contribute to the growth and malignant phenotypes of HT-29 tumors, suggesting that PC inhibition strategies may be a useful adduct to the arsenal of colorectal anticancer gene therapies.
12414625	Constitutive activation of insulin receptor substrate 1 is a frequent event in human tumors: therapeutic implications.	Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) is a major substrate of insulin, insulin-like growth factors, and cytokine signaling and plays an important role in mediating apoptosis, cell differentiation, and cell transformation. We found that IRS-1 is constitutively activated in a variety of solid tumors, including breast cancers, leiomyomas, Wilms' tumors, rhabdomyosarcomas, liposarcomas, leiomyosarcomas, and adrenal cortical carcinomas. Blocking the constitutively activated IRS-1 signaling in breast cancer cells with a dominant-negative IRS-1, an IRS-1 with all 18 potential tyrosine-phosphorylation sites replaced by phenylalanines (F18), dramatically reduced cancer cell growth. Breast cancer cells that expressed F18 also formed smaller and far fewer colonies in soft agar culture than did the cells that did not express F18. These studies suggest that constitutive IRS-1 activation is a common phenomenon in tumors and that activated IRS-1 may present an attractive therapeutic target.
12615821	Polymorphism in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma gene in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.	BACKGROUND: In view of the strong evidence implicating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) in adiposity and insulin resistance a study was carried out to investigate PPARgamma genotype frequencies in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and to elucidate its role in the pathogenesis of the syndrome. METHODS: The study involved 135 women with PCOS and 115 healthy control women who were genotyped for a known functional variant of the PPARgamma gene using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. RESULTS: A significantly different allele distribution of the Pro12 Ala polymorphism of the PPARgamma gene was observed between the two groups, with the frequency of the variant Ala isoform being significantly reduced in the PCOS group (12.6%) when compared with the control group (19.1%) (P = 0.045), at an odds ratio of 0.609 (95% confidence interval: 0.374-0.991). The genotype distributions of the Pro12 Ala polymorphism in the PCOS and control groups were different with borderline significance (P = 0.051). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a role for PPARgamma gene polymorphism in the pathogenesis of PCOS, the presence of the Ala isoform being protective against the development of PCOS.
7560521	The information needs of women newly diagnosed with breast cancer.	Nurses can play a key role in patient education, including providing patients with useful and appropriate information. Rather than focusing on the process of education or information giving by nurses, this study places emphasis on the content of that information by taking the patients' perspective and asking the patients themselves what particular types of information are perceived as important at a specific point in time. The aim of the study was to explore what particular types of information were important to women newly diagnosed with breast cancer; to enable nurses and other health care professionals to utilize their time as effectively as possible and provide a high-quality service to individuals in their care. Women with breast cancer (a mean of 2.5 weeks from diagnosis) were interviewed and asked to compare items of information. The items of information were presented in pairs and the women stated a preference for one item in that pair. Thirty-six pairs were presented in total. The analysis involved the use of a Thurstone scaling model, which allowed rank orderings, or profiles of information needs, to be developed, reflecting the perceived importance of each item. Information about the likelihood of cure, the spread of the disease and treatment options were perceived as the most important items of information at the time of diagnosis. Other information needs, in order of descending priority, included information about the risk to family, side-effects of treatments, impact on family, self-care, effect on social life and sexual attractiveness. Profiles of information needs were produced to take account of differences in age, level of education and social class.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
8093054	Leu 193 mutation in the cysteine rich region of the insulin receptor inhibits the cleavage of the insulin receptor precursor but not insulin binding.	To characterize the Leu 193 mutant insulin receptor, which was found in a patient with extreme insulin resistance, the mutant insulin receptor was overexpressed in Rat-1 fibroblasts by transfection of mutated insulin receptor cDNA. In the pulse-chase experiment, the cleavage of the proreceptors to the matured receptor subunits was impaired in the cells expressing Leu 193 insulin receptor and therefore, the mutant proreceptors were accumulated in the cell. Insulin bound to the Leu 193 insulin receptor on the cell surface with normal affinity, although the mutation was in the alpha-subunit of the insulin receptor. Therefore, the Leu 193 mutation impaired proreceptor cleavage but not insulin binding.
8661216	Insulin promotes pancreatic cancer: evidence for endocrine influence on exocrine pancreatic tumors.	Type-II diabetes is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. In addition, diabetic patients present with more advanced tumors and have shortened survival compared to stage-matched counterparts. We hypothesize that the diabetic endocrine milieu, particularly elevated plasma insulin, favors pancreatic cancer growth. This study examines six human pancreatic cancer cell lines for the presence of insulin receptors and the influence of insulin on tumor proliferation. Classical competitive binding assays are performed using [125I insulin. Cell proliferation assays are conducted over 3 days on cultured cell lines (n = 6 replicates) with increasing concentrations of insulin. Insulin receptors are demonstrated on all six cell lines and dose dependent increases in cell proliferation (15-120% of control) are demonstrated in response to insulin. Patients with type-II diabetes hypersecrete insulin. The presence of high-affinity insulin receptors and dose dependent increases in pancreatic cancer cell proliferation with insulin supports the hypothesis that insulin may be an important tumor growth promoter in diabetes, particularly if paracrine mechanisms are involved. Additional study is required to determine whether other islet peptides altered in diabetes influence tumor growth and whether elevated plasma insulin favors pancreatic cancer induction.
9024787	The IGF-I receptor in mitogenesis and transformation of mouse embryo cells: role of receptor number.	The type 1 receptor for insulin-like growth factors (IGF-IR) plays an important role in the growth and transformation of several types of cells. We have investigated the role of IGF-IR number in IGF-I-mediated mitogenesis and transformation of mouse embryo fibroblasts. We have used R- cells (3T3-like cells originating from mouse embryos with a targeted disruption of the IGF-IR genes) transfected with a plasmid expressing the human IGF-IR cDNA to generate clones with receptor numbers ranging from zero to 10(6) receptors per cell. In this model, between 15,000 and 22,000 receptors per cell are sufficient to render mouse embryo cells competent to grow in serum-free medium supplemented solely with IGF-I. For growth in soft agar, 30,000 receptors per cell seem to be the minimum requirement. These experiments indicate that a small increment in the number of receptors per cell, well within the physiological range, can modulate the mitogenic and transforming activities of the IGF-IR in 3T3-like cells.
9038347	Development of a novel polygenic model of NIDDM in mice heterozygous for IR and IRS-1 null alleles.	NIDDM is a polygenic disease characterized by insulin resistance in muscle, fat, and liver, followed by a failure of pancreatic beta cells to adequately compensate for this resistance despite increased insulin secretion. Mice double heterozygous for null alleles in the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 genes exhibit the expected approximately 50% reduction in expression of these two proteins, but a synergism at a level of insulin resistance with 5- to 50-fold elevated plasma insulin levels and comparable levels of beta cell hyperplasia. At 4-6 months of age, 40% of these double heterozygotes become overtly diabetic. This NIDDM mouse model in which diabetes arises in an age-dependent manner from the interaction between two genetically determined, subclinical defects in the insulin signaling cascade demonstrates the role of epistatic interactions in the pathogenesis of common diseases with non-Mendelian genetics.
10401676	Insulin/IGF-I hybrid receptors play a major role in IGF-I signaling in thyroid cancer.	The insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) plays an important role in determining the biological behavior of a variety of malignancies. We measured IGF-I, its receptor and related receptors in thyroid cancer. IGF-I was present both in normal thyroid tissue and in thyroid cancer tissue and it was produced by stromal cells but not by thyrocytes. Values were significantly higher in malignant than in normal tissue. IGF-I receptors (IGF-I-Rs) and the homologous insulin receptors (IRs) were found overexpressed in both thyroid cancer cell lines (n = 4) and specimens (n = 17) as compared to normal values. In addition, high levels of hybrid IGF-I/insulin receptors (IR/IGF-I-Rs) were present in both thyroid cancer specimens and cell lines. IR/IGF-I-R hybrids were the most represented type of receptor in 14/17 specimens and exceeded the IGF-I-R content in all cases. Hybrid content correlated with the IR and IGF-I-R content, suggesting that in thyroid tissue hybrid formation occurs by random assembly of IR and IGF-I-R half receptors. Hybrid receptor autophosphorylation was stimulated by IGF-I with high affinity. In cells with a high IR/IGF-I-Rs content, blocking antibodies specific to these receptors substantially inhibited IGF-I induced cell growth. These data indicate that the IGF-I system is overactivated in thyroid cancer and that IR/IGF-I-R hybrid receptors play an important role in IGF-I mitogenic signaling in these tumors.
11885994	Oestrogen/insulin-like growth factor-I receptor interaction in early breast cancer: clinical implications.	UNLABELLED: The expression of oestrogen receptor (ER) and that of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) are positively correlated in breast cancer specimens. Their function is strongly linked in enhancing proliferative activity in normal and malignant human mammary epithelial cells in culture. This review examines the likely role of such a mechanism in the increased breast cancer risk reported in postmenopausal women with abdominal obesity. Precancerous breast lesions show an increased proportion of ER-positive cells with high proliferative activity, and recent studies suggest that genetic mutations or epigenetic variants in the ER alpha gene may increase the ER's sensitivity to oestrogen stimulation. Abdominal obesity in women is associated with higher concentrations both of free oestradiol and free IGF-I. Activation of their respective receptors may induce synergistic stimulation of mammary carcinogenesis. However, there is clinical evidence that progression in precancerous breast lesions may be delayed or reversed. Involution occurs spontaneously in a proportion of duct carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (intraductal) lesions as women approach the menopause, and antioestrogen therapy has been shown to reduce recurrence and progression of DCIS lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Intervention trials in breast cancer prevention would greatly benefit from surrogate response markers which could predict long-term benefit. Changes in ER and IGF-IR expression apart from those in standardised cytomorphological criteria, might predict the likelihood of DCIS involution in cancer prevention trials. Future studies could involve examination of serial core biopsies from normal breast tissue during trials of antioestrogens, retinoids or weight-reduction interventions. Correlation of changes in these markers with changes in circulating IGF-I and oestradiol concentrations may help to clarify the roles of the markers.
12188907	Insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 as an anti-cancer target: blocking transformation and inducing apoptosis.	IGF-IR (Insulin-like growth factor receptor 1) is a tetrameric glycoprotein composed of two alpha and two beta subunits. The alpha subunit localizes extra-cellularly for ligand binding, whereas the beta subunit consists of transmembrane chains and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain for enzymatic activity. IGF-IR ligands, IGF-I and IGF-II, are mitogens and survival factors for many cancer cells. Binding of ligands to the IGF-IR initiates a cascade of events leading to activation of signal transduction pathways, mainly MAPK and PI-3K pathways, to stimulate proliferation/mitogenesis, to induce neoplastic transformation, to inhibit apoptosis, and to promote angiogenesis and metastasis. It has been shown that the presence of IGF-IR was required for transformation induced by many oncogenes and over-expression or constitutive activation of IGF-IR gave rise to transformed phenotypes. Significantly, over-expression of IGF-IR was observed in multiple human cancers including carcinomas of breast, lung, colon, and prostate. Patients with IGF-IR positive cancers had a worse prognosis in some cases. Furthermore, down-regulation or functional inactivation of IGF-IR sensitized tumor cells to apoptosis and reversed tumor cell phenotype. Thus, IGF-IR appears to be a promising cancer target. Indeed, a variety of approaches aimed at targeting IGF-IR have been utilized to prove the concept, or are being developed for potential anticancer therapies. These include targeting functional IGF-IR on cell surface, targeting ligand/receptor interaction, targeting receptor expression and functions, and targeting receptor kinase activity. Cancer patients could eventually benefit from the development of these specific IGF-IR antagonists.
8995674	Characterization of the human cytomegalovirus irs1 and trs1 genes: a second immediate-early transcription unit within irs1 whose product antagonizes transcriptional activation.	We have characterized the irs1 and trs1 genes of human cytomegalovirus. The previously identified mRNAs as well as their corresponding protein products pIRS1 and pTRS1 could be detected during all phases of the viral replication cycle. The proteins were present in the nucleus and cytoplasm during the immediate-early and early phases of the viral growth cycle but were predominantly cytoplasmic late after infection. Although pIRS1 and pTRS1 exhibited little transcriptional activation potential on their own, both cooperated with the IE1 and IE2 proteins to enhance expression from a variety of viral promoters. We have also identified a previously undescribed immediate-early gene product encoded within the irs1 gene that we have termed pIRS1(263). This new protein is encoded within the 3' end of the irs1 gene and is in the same reading frame as the large pIRS1 protein. Expression of the irs1(263) gene is controlled by a promoter that resides within the irs1 open reading frame in the unique short region of the viral genome. pIRS1(263) resides in the nucleus and antagonizes transcriptional activation by cytomegalovirus immediate-early proteins. We propose that pIRS1(263), whose promoter responds to immediate-early transcriptional activators, serves as part of a regulatory loop, antagonizing the function of the viral proteins that are responsible for its synthesis.
10459850	Discordant expression of insulin-like growth factors and their receptor messenger ribonucleic acids in endometrial carcinomas relative to normal endometrium.	The inappropriate expressions of insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and II) and IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) are implicated in the malignant growth of many cancers. To determine changes, if any, in the levels of expression of IGFs and IGF receptor genes in neoplastic endometrium, relative to normal endometrium, the mRNA levels of IGF-I and II and of IGF-IR and IIR were measured in samples of endometrial carcinomas (EC) and normal endometrium, through all phases of the menstrual cycle, by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. In normal endometrium, the mRNA levels of IGF-I were elevated in the proliferative and early secretory phases. The IGF-II mRNAs were relatively high in the proliferative phase, but unaltered through early and late secretory phases. Significantly elevated levels of IGF-II transcripts were observed during the menstrual phase, suggesting a possible role of IGF-II in endometrial regeneration. A positive correlation between the levels of IGF-I and IGF-IR mRNAs, apparent in the samples of normal endometrium, was not observed in endometrial carcinomas. The IGF-IR and IIR mRNA levels were elevated in endometrial carcinoma samples. On the other hand, the IGF-I and II mRNA levels were conspicuously low in many carcinoma samples, which were not associated with hyperplasia (type II EC), but relatively elevated in two other carcinoma samples, associated with adenomatous hyperplasia (type I EC). These results albeit with few samples suggest the possibility that the overexpressed receptor, IGF-IR, could be activated differently in two types of endometrial carcinomas, namely ligand-dependently in type I ECs and ligand-independently in type II ECs.
11735220	Single-nucleotide polymorphism alleles in the insulin receptor gene are associated with typical migraine.	We have identified a migraine locus on chromosome 19p13.3/2 using linkage and association analysis. We isolated 48 single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the locus, of which we genotyped 24 in a Caucasian population comprising 827 unrelated cases and 765 controls. Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the insulin receptor gene showed significant association with migraine. This association was independently replicated in a case-control population collected separately. We used experiments with insulin receptor RNA and protein to investigate functionality for the migraine-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We suggest possible functions for the insulin receptor in migraine pathogenesis.
11921191	Genetic regulation of ionizing radiation sensitivity and breast cancer risk.	Genetic variability in DNA repair may contribute to hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) and susceptibility to breast cancer. We used samples collected from a clinic-based breast cancer case-control study to test the working hypothesis that amino acid substitution variants of DNA repair genes may contribute to prolonged cell-cycle delay following IR and breast cancer risk. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis was used to measure cell-cycle delay. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assays were used to determine four genotypes of three DNA repair genes: XRCC1, 194 Arg/Trp and 399 Arg/Gln; XRCC3, 241 Thr/Met; and APE1, 148 Asp/Glu. The data showed that breast cancer patients had a significantly higher delay index than that of controls (P < 0.001); the means +/- SD for cases and controls were 36.0 +/- 13.1 (n = 118) and 31.4 +/- 11.5 (n = 225), respectively. There was a significant dose-response relationship between delay index, categorized into quartiles, and an increasing risk of breast cancer (crude odds ratios: 1.00, 1.00, 1.27, and 2.46, respectively; P(trend) = 0.002). In controls, prolonged cell-cycle delay was significantly associated with the number of variant alleles in APE1 Asp148Glu and XRCC1 Arg399Gln genotypes (P(trend) = 0.001). Although larger studies are needed to validate the results, our data suggest that an inherited hypersensitivity to IR may contribute to human breast carcinogenesis.
12447687	In IGF-I receptor-deficient leiomyosarcoma cells autocrine IGF-II induces cell invasion and protection from apoptosis via the insulin receptor isoform A.	One of the two isoforms of the human insulin receptor (isoform A or IR-A) binds IGF-II with high affinity and is predominantly expressed in fetal tissues and malignant cells. We evaluated the biological relevance of IR-A in human myosarcoma cells. Six myosarcoma cell lines were studied. All produced high amounts of IGF-II and five of them predominantly expressed IR-A. SKUT-1 leiomyosarcoma cells, that do not express the IGF-IR, were identified as a suitable model to study the effects of IR-A in the absence of the interference of IGF-IR. In these cells, which express high levels of IR with an IR-A relative abundance of approximately 95%, IGF-II elicits biological effects exclusively via IR-A activation and IGF-I is almost ineffective. Blockade of autocrine IGF-II reduced unstimulated cell viability and migration. Although both insulin and IGF-II activate IR-A, these two ligands showed a different ability to activate different intracellular signaling pathways and to elicit different biological effects. Insulin was more potent than IGF-II in activating the PI3-K/Akt pathway and in protecting cells from apoptosis. In contrast, IGF-II was more potent than insulin in activating the Shc/ERK pathway and in stimulating cell migration. These data indicate that IGF-II sensitive IR-A is the predominant IR isoform in a variety of myosarcoma cells. In SKUT-1 leiomyoma cells this fetal IR isoform may vicariate the IGF-IR for cell response to both insulin and IGF-II. Acting on the same IR-A receptor IGF-II is more potent than insulin in stimulating cancer cell migration.
7494873	The genetic basis of cellular recovery from radiation damage: response of the radiosensitive irs lines to low-dose-rate irradiation.	Recovery from the lethal effects of irradiation is commonly found when cultured mammalian cells are irradiated at low dose rates when compared to the same cells irradiated at higher dose rates. However, this cellular recovery process is severely reduced or absent in a number of radiosensitive cell lines, including those derived from the human disorder ataxia telangiectasia (AT). The genetic and molecular basis of such recovery processes is not understood, despite their importance. The responses of cells of three further radiosensitive lines, irs1, irs2 and irs3, shown previously to be mutated in different genes, to low-dose-rate radiation are now presented. Plateau-phase cultures of cells of the irs2 line were found to have little or no cellular recovery, while irs1 and irs3 had considerable recovery potential. In comparing the known properties of the radiosensitive lines lacking cellular recovery, including xrs, XR-1 and scid as well as AT and irs2, it is argued that the gene products lacking in these lines normally act coordinately in a specific damage-recognition pathway. The recovery pathway is likely to be associated with the rejoining of DNA double-strand breaks, since several of these recovery-defective lines have a measurable deficiency in break repair.
7714091	Insulin resistance associated with decreased levels of insulin-receptor messenger ribonucleic acid: evidence of a de novo mutation in the maternal allele.	Mutations in the insulin receptor gene may lead to insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus in some patients. We have studied an insulin-resistant patient with leprechaunism. Insulin binding to the patient's fibroblasts was markedly decreased. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of the patient's insulin receptor gene revealed heterozygosity for a 2-basepair deletion in exon 15. If the premessenger ribonucleic acid (pre-mRNA) is spliced normally, it causes a replacement of codon 970 in the beta-subunit with a premature chain termination codon, thereby deleting most of the intracellular domain of the receptor. The mRNA transcribed from the allele with a 2-base-pair deletion is likely to be unstable because mRNA transcripts from this allele could not be detected by complementary DNA sequencing. Northern blot analysis showed that the patient's insulin receptor mRNA was decreased by 90% compared with that of a control subject, thus suggesting that the patient is a compound heterozygote for two mutations that decrease levels of insulin receptor mRNA. This deletion mutation in exon 15 seems to be a de novo mutation, because it was not detected in either parent. Investigation of the inheritance of a silent sequence polymorphism in exon 17 provided that the deletion occurred in the maternal allele. Furthermore, linkage analysis suggests that the second mutation is derived from the patient's father, although we could not directly identify it by sequencing the coding region of the insulin receptor gene. Therefore, it is possible that this mutation is present in a regulatory domain of the insulin receptor gene, acting in cis-dominant fashion to reduce the levels of insulin receptor mRNA. Analyses of the hypervariable region in the myoglobin and pMCT118 loci were consistent with the assumption that the father and mother studied here are indeed the biological parents of the diseased patient. We hereby conclude that the patient is a compound heterozygote for two mutant alleles, both of which are responsible for the reduced levels of insulin receptor mRNA and insulin binding.
8834239	SSCP analysis of the tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor gene: polymorphisms detected in South African black and white subjects.	The frequency of DNA polymorphisms in the tyrosine kinase domain (exons 17-21) of the insulin receptor gene was assessed in 30 black and 30 white South Africans, using single-stranded conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing analysis. A comparison of the frequencies of the normal versus the combined polymorphic alleles, found only in exon 17, showed a significant difference between black and white groups (P = 0.037).
9548597	Apolipoprotein E2 (Arg136 --> Cys) mutation in the receptor binding domain of apoE is not associated with dominant type III hyperlipoproteinemia.	Using apoE phenotyping by immunoblotting and apoE genotyping we identified four heterozygous carriers of a rare apolipoprotein (apo) E2 variant, apoE2 (Arg136 --> Cys). ApoE2 (Arg136 --> Cys) was not distinct from apoE2 (Arg158 --> Cys) by phenotyping, but produced a unique pattern of bands on CfoI restriction typing of a 244 bp apoE gene fragment. Two of the four apoE2 (Arg136 --> Cys)/3 heterozygotes had elevated triglycerides, two were normolipidemic. The composition of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) was normal in each of the four apoE2 (Arg136 --> Cys) carriers, regardless of the triglyceride concentrations. None of the apoE2 (Arg136 --> Cys) carriers displayed a broad beta-band and none revealed beta-migrating particles in the VLDL. The two hypertriglyceridemic carriers of apoE2 (Arg136 --> Cys) were, therefore, classified as having type IV rather than type III hyperlipoproteinemia. LDL receptor binding activities were studied using recombinant apoE loaded to dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) vesicles and to VLDL and from an apoE-deficient individual. LDL receptor binding of apoE2 (Arg136 --> Cys) was 14% of apoE3 and was thus higher than that of apoE2 (Arg158 --> Cys). Both apoE2 (Arg136 --> Cys) and apoE2 (Arg158 --> Cys) displayed substantial heparin binding (61 and 53% of apoE3, respectively). As the dominant apoE variants known so far are characterized by more pronounced reductions of heparin binding, we suggest that apoE2 (Arg136 --> Cys) is not associated with dominant expression of type III hyperlipoproteinemia. These findings lend support to the concept that apoE variants predisposing to dominant type III hyperlipoproteinemia differ from recessive mutations by a more severe defect in heparin binding.
9713365	Promoter-specific insulin-like growth factor 2 gene imprinting in human fetal liver and hepatoblastoma.	Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene imprinting has been demonstrated to be promoter-specific, in that expression from the P1 promoter is biallelic whereas that from the P2-P4 promoters is monoallelic. In the present study, in order to investigate IGF2 gene imprinting status at the cellular level, allelic analysis was performed of IGF2 gene expression transcribed from the P1 and P3 promoters, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on human fetal liver and hepatoblastoma. In situ hybridization was also undertaken, to obtain information about the cellular localization of transcripts expressed from the P1 and P3 promoters. The results indicated that transcripts expressed from the P1 and P3 promoters co-localized in the same fetal or neoplastic hepatocytes. These data should provide information regarding the molecular basis of genomic imprinting, suggesting that an imprint recognized for the differential expression may be strictly local and localized downstream of the IGF2 P1 promoter.
9766646	Enhanced expression of the insulin receptor substrate-2 docking protein in human pancreatic cancer.	Insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) is a multisite docking protein implicated in mitogenic signaling after activation of the insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I receptors. In the present study, we characterized IRS-2 expression and function in human pancreatic cancer. IRS-2 mRNA and protein were expressed in ASPC-1 and COLO-357 human pancreatic cancer cell lines. Insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II enhanced the growth of both cell lines, stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2, and increased IRS-2-associated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity. The mitogenic effects of insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II were markedly attenuated by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002. Northern blot analysis of total RNA extracted from normal and cancerous tissues revealed that IRS-2 mRNA levels were increased in the cancer tissues (P = 0.032). In the normal pancreas, IRS-2 immunoreactivity was present at low levels in some ductal and acinar cells and at moderate levels in a heterogeneous pattern in all of the endocrine islets. In the pancreatic cancers, IRS-2 was abundant in the ductal-like cancer cells. These findings indicate that IRS-2 is overexpressed in human pancreatic cancer and suggest that it may contribute to enhanced mitogenic signaling via the PI 3-kinase pathway, thereby leading to excessive growth stimulation in this malignancy.
10438568	Characterization of an antibody that can detect an activated IGF-I receptor in human cancers.	The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) plays an important role in malignant transformation and in apoptosis. Its role in human cancer has now been firmly established. IGF-IR signaling occurs only when the receptor is activated by its ligands, which induce autophosphorylation of the receptor at several tyrosine residues. Although the IGF-IR (phosphorylated or not) can be detected in human cancers with conventional antibodies, it would be desirable to obtain antibodies that can detect the IGF-IR only when activated by its ligands. We describe and characterize in this paper such an antibody and show that it can be used in sections of human cancers to detect an autophosphorylated IGF-IR. This antibody will be useful in detecting autocrine or paracrine influences on normal and tumor cells and could eventually be also useful in diagnostic and prognostic studies of human primary and metastatic cancer.
10859639	Does the mechanism responsible for TNF-mediated insulin resistance involve the proteasome?	Recent studies have demonstrated that in many pathological states there is an overproduction of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF). Interestingly, TNF also seems to be responsible for the insulin resistance associated with these pathological states, since decreases the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor. Our group has demonstrated that TNF is able to activate the proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Since this proteolytic system is involved in the control of receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity (i.e. insulin receptor), it is postulated here that the mechanism of TNF-induced insulin resistance is mediated by the activation of the proteasomic, ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis.
11507082	In vivo progression of LAPC-9 and LNCaP prostate cancer models to androgen independence is associated with increased expression of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR).	Androgen deprivation therapies for metastatic prostate cancer are useful initially, but progression to androgen independence usually results in relapse within 2 years. The molecular mechanisms underlying the clinically important transition from androgen dependence to androgen independence are poorly described. Several lines of investigation have suggested that insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are involved in the biology of prostate cancer, but little is known about their relevance to progression to androgen independence. We used three in vivo models of androgen-dependent (AD) human prostate cancer to study this issue. Progression to androgen-independent (AI) growth was associated with a 60-fold increase in expression of IGF-I mRNA in LAPC-9 xenografts and a 28-fold increase in IGF-I expression in LNCAP xenografts, relative to the initial AD neoplasms. IGF type I receptor (IGF-IR) mRNA levels were approximately 2.5-fold and approximately 5-fold higher, respectively, in AI LAPC-9 and LNCaP tumors compared with the original AD neoplasms. AI growth of these xenografts was also associated with significant reductions in IGF binding protein-3 expression. LAPC-4 xenografts, which previously have been shown to exhibit molecular pathology related to HER-2/neu expression with progression to AI, showed relatively minor changes in expression of the genes investigated, but we nevertheless found evidence of increased IGF-IR phosphorylation with progression to androgen independence in this model. Taken together with prior observations, our results suggest that deregulation of expression of genes related to any one of several critical receptor tyrosine kinase regulatory systems, including IGF signaling, may confer androgen independence.
7664648	Growth inhibition of MCF-7 breast cancer cells by stable expression of an insulin-like growth factor I receptor antisense ribonucleic acid.	Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) play an important role in cellular proliferation, and IGF action appears to be involved in tumorigenesis. To determine the role of the IGF-I receptor in breast cancer cell growth, we stably transfected MCF-7 breast cancer cells with a construct encoding an antisense RNA complementary to the region surrounding the translation initiation site of the IGF-I receptor messenger RNA (mRNA). Control cells were transfected with vector alone. Clones expressing the antisense RNA exhibited a 30% reduction in endogenous IGF-I receptor mRNA levels and a significant reduction in receptor protein levels, as measured by both ligand binding assays and Western blot analysis. Antisense-expressing clones expressed approximately 30,000 receptors/cell compared with approximately 48,000-58,000 receptors/cell in control (neo) cells (P < 0.05). Although endogenous RNA:RNA hybrids were demonstrable in antisense-expressing cells, our results suggest that the major effect of the antisense may be the reduction in mRNA levels and not via an inhibition of translation. The reduction in receptor expression reduced both IGF-I- and serum-stimulated cellular proliferation. The maximum cell number reached at 96 h in the presence of IGF-I (100 ng/ml) was significantly reduced in antisense-expressing clones (22,000-30,000) compared with that in control (neo) cells (39,000-42,000). Furthermore, IGF-I-induced c-fos gene expression was reduced by 30% in the clones expressing the antisense RNA. These results strongly support a role for the IGF-I receptor in the proliferation of human breast cancer cells and suggest that strategies using this type of technology may prove useful in cancer therapy.
7983803	[Insulin receptor gene in an etiology of Japanese NIDDM].	We reviewed 23 Japanese patients with mutation in the insulin receptor gene. In general, patients with two mutant alleles tend to be more severely insulin-resistant than those with one mutant allele. Most of the mutations have been identified in patients with genetic syndromes associated with extreme insulin resistance. However, some patients having a mutation in the insulin receptor gene (especially in the tyrosine kinase domain), were moderately insulin-resistant. In these cases, despite having a same mutation in the insulin receptor gene, some individuals exhibited significant clinical differences (e.g. insulin resistance or glucose tolerance). Although mutations in the insulin receptor gene can cause insulin resistance, we assume that other genetic or behavioral factors may alter the clinical phenotype in patients with same mutations in the insulin receptor gene. Nevertheless, mutations in the insulin receptor gene may be a contributory cause of insulin resistance in a subpopulation (approximately 1%) of NIDDM.
9815941	Overexpression of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 induces loss of estrogen requirements for growth and transformation.	The synergistic action of estrogens and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) promotes the growth of many human breast cancer cell lines. This synergistic effect involves estrogen-dependent induction of the IGF system, i.e., estrogens augment the number of IGF-I receptors, stimulate the secretion of IGF-II, and promote the synthesis of certain IGF-binding proteins. On the other hand, the sustained activation of the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) by the overexpression of IGF-II has been found to contribute to the development of the estrogen-independent phenotype in breast cancer cells. In this study, we have investigated whether the amplification of the IGF-IR intracellular signaling in MCF-7 cells can abolish or reduce estrogen requirements for growth and transformation. To this end we developed several MCF-7 clones that overexpressed insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), one of the principal substrates of the IGF-IR. We report here that in MCF-7 cells overexpressing IRS-1, estrogen requirements for growth in monolayer culture as well as in soft agar were reduced. The decreased estrogen requirements depended on the level of the overexpressed IRS-1 protein, and in cells which contained several-fold more functional IRS-1 than the parental cells, we observed total loss of estrogen dependence for growth. In addition, the importance of IRS-1 in proliferation of MCF-7 cells has been confirmed through the use of antisense strategies.
10229198	Insulin receptor activation by IGF-II in breast cancers: evidence for a new autocrine/paracrine mechanism.	IGF-II, produced by breast cancer epithelial and stromal cells, enhances tumor growth by activating the IGF-I receptor (IGF-I-R) via autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Previously we found that the insulin receptor (IR), which is related to the IGF-I-R, is overexpressed in breast cancer cells. Herein, we find that, in breast cancer the IR is activated by IGF-II. In eight human breast cancer cell lines studied there was high affinity IGF-II binding to the IR, with subsequent IR activation. In these lines, IGF-II had a potency up to 63% that of insulin. In contrast, in non malignant human breast cells, IGF-II was less than 1% potent as insulin. Via activation of the IR tyrosine kinase IGF-II stimulated breast cancer cell growth. Moreover, IGF-II also activated the IR in breast cancer tissue specimens; IGF-II was 10-100% as potent as insulin. The IR occurs in two isoforms generated by alternative splicing of exon 11; these isoforms are IR-A (Ex11-) and IR-B (Ex11+). IR-A was predominantly expressed in breast cancer cells and specimens and the potency of IGF-II was correlated to the expression of this isoform (P<0.0001). These data indicate, therefore, that the IR-A, which binds IGF-II with high affinity, is predominantly expressed in breast cancer cells and represents a new autocrine/paracrine loop involved in tumor biology.
10916281	Lack of association between the -308 polymorphism of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene and the insulin resistance syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated a role for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in insulin resistance. A polymorphic variant of the TNF-alpha gene, the TNF2 allele, which is a guanine to adenine polymorphism at position -308 in the TNF-alpha promoter, is associated with higher basal and inducible promoter activity. The present study examined whether the TNF2 allele was associated with altered levels of different components of the insulin resistance syndrome, clustering of these components, or the 10-year change in the level of these components. METHODS: Components of the insulin resistance syndrome included insulin resistance, as determined by fasting insulin levels, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, uric acid, and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol. The study population was a subsample of participants from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in (Young) Adults (CARDIA) study, which included African American and white men and women aged 18-30. The sample included 243 black women, 142 black men, 392 white women, and 386 white men. Subjects were typed at the TNF-alpha locus. RESULTS: The frequency of the TNF2 allele was 12% in blacks and 16% in whites. Age-adjusted levels of the different components examined were not different at either baseline or year 10 in carriers of the TNF2 allele versus homozygotes for the wild-type allele, and the 10-year change in the level of different components was not different between the two genotype groups. There also was no evidence of increased clustering of components of the insulin resistance syndrome in carriers of the TNF2 allele. Moreover, there was no evidence of an association between the TNF2 allele and clustering across quartiles of BMI or quartiles of dietary fat intake (i.e., Key's score). CONCLUSIONS: In African Americans and whites, neither the TNF2 allele nor another polymorphism in the TNF-alpha gene or a neighboring gene with which the TNF2 allele is in linkage disequilibrium is associated with differences in the level of or increased clustering of components of the insulin resistance syndrome.
10985759	Role of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor, IGF-I, and IGF binding protein-2 in human colorectal cancers.	The identification of novel autocrine/paracrine signaling pathways and possible markers represents an important component in the understanding of tumor growth control. In this study, we assessed the potential role of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) and IGF binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) in human colorectal cancer. Initial studies demonstrating increased IGF-I binding and IGF-IR density in human colon cancer tissue revealed that a component of iodinated (3-[125-I]iodotyrosyl) IGF-I (125I-ICGF-I) binding was not attributable to IGF-IR. Binding studies and Western blot analysis suggested that this second component of 125I-IGF-I binding could be due to IGFBP-2. Further analysis by a specific solution hybridization/RNase protection assay for IGF-IR mRNA levels, IGFBP-2 mRNA levels and in situ hybridization for IGFBP-2 localization, was carried out in nine patients with colon cancer. IGF-IR mRNA levels by RNAse protection assays were unchanged, whereas IGFBP-2 mRNA levels were increased 4-8-fold in patients with colon cancer compared to controls. Three patients with Dukes stage C disease had the highest levels of IGFBP-2 mRNA. In situ hybridization studies localized IGFBP-2 mRNA to malignant cells and not to the surrounding stromal cells, suggesting an autocrine role for IGFBP-2. The discrepancy between increased IGF-I binding, IGF-IR density, IGFBP-2 mRNA and the minimal modulation of the IGF-IR mRNA implies post-transcriptional regulation of IGF-IRs. Our results suggest that IGFBP-2 may be implicated in colon cancer metastases and prognosis. Its usefulness as a potential tumor marker should be further investigated.
12196249	ATM induction insufficiency in a radiosensitive breast-cancer patient.	The ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) gene (ATM) is a dominant breast cancer gene with tumour suppressor activity. ATM also regulates cellular sensitivity to ionising radiation (IR) presumably through its role as a facilitator of DNA repair. In normal cells and tissues the ATM protein is rapidly induced by IR to threshold/maximum levels. The kinase function of the ATM protein is also rapidly activated in response to IR. The fact that women carriers of ATM mutations can have an increased risk of developing breast cancer and that many sporadic breast tumours have reduced levels of the ATM protein broadens the scope of ATM's tumour suppressor within the breast. This report describes the downregulation of ATM protein levels in a radiosensitive breast cancer patient. Postinduction ATM levels were up to tenfold lower in the patient's fresh tissues compared to normal controls. These results might indicate a much broader role for ATM anomalies in breast cancer aetiology.
12641820	Serum and tissue level of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF-I binding proteins as an index of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.	Previously we have found deregulation of collagen metabolism in human pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer tissues. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is known to stimulate collagen biosynthesis through interaction with IGF-I receptor. IGF-I binding proteins (BPs) regulate the activity of IGF-I. We investigated whether serum and tissue IGF-I and IGF-BPs as well as tissue IGF-I receptor expression may reflect disturbances of collagen metabolism in patients with pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. In pancreatitis tissue, a significant increase in IGF-I and IGFBP-3 content was accompanied by a distinct increase in IGF-I receptor expression, compared to control pancreas tissue. In contrast, serum from patients with pancreatitis did not show significant increases in IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels, however, significant increases in IGFBP-1 level (2.5 fold). Moreover, a distinct decrease in radioactive IGF-binding to the BPs, compared to control serum, was found. Pancreatic cancer tissue and serum of patients with pancreatic cancer showed significant increases in IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-1 content, accompanied by dramatic increases in IGF-I tissue receptor expression, compared to controls. In serum of patients with pancreatic cancer distinct increases in radioactive IGF-binding to 46 kDa BP, compared to control serum, were observed. The data suggest that disturbances in tissue collagen metabolism during pancreatic diseases may result from deregulation of IGF-I homeostasis and that elevated serum levels of IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-1 may serve as markers of pancreatic cancer.
12788928	In vivo mutagenesis of the insulin receptor.	Mice bearing targeted gene mutations that affect insulin receptor (Insr) function have contributed important new information on the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Whereas complete Insr ablation is lethal, conditional mutagenesis in selected tissues has more limited consequences on metabolism. Studies of mice with tissue-specific ablation of Insr have indicated that both canonical (e.g. muscle and adipose tissue) and noncanonical (e.g. liver, pancreatic beta-cells, and brain) insulin target tissues can contribute to insulin resistance, albeit in a pathogenically distinct fashion. Furthermore, experimental crosses of Insr mutants with mice carrying mutations that affect insulin action at more distal steps of the insulin signaling cascade have begun to unravel the genetics of type 2 diabetes. These studies are consistent with an oligogenic inheritance, in which synergistic interactions among few alleles may account for the genetic susceptibility to diabetes. In addition to mutant alleles conferring an increased risk of diabetes, these studies have uncovered mutations that protect against insulin resistance, thus providing proof-of-principle for the notion that certain alleles may confer resistance to diabetes.
7829525	Characterization of the endogenous insulin receptor-related receptor in neuroblastomas.	A gene encoding a putative third member of the insulin receptor family (called the insulin receptor-related receptor or IRR) was isolated in 1989. However, the naturally occurring protein product encoded by this gene has yet to be described. In the present studies, we have generated four monoclonal antibodies to a recombinantly expressed chimera, which contains the extracellular domain of human IRR. These antibodies were found to specifically recognize the chimeric IRR (and not the insulin or insulin-like growth factor I receptors), and two of the antibodies were capable of acting as partial agonists in the cells expressing the chimeric IRR. These antibodies have therefore been utilized to study the expression and properties of the native receptor. In contrast to the two other members of this receptor family, the endogenous IRR protein had only a very limited expression, being detected only in neuroblastomas. In primary neuroblastomas, the levels of the receptor were highest in samples from stage A tumors (those which are generally more highly differentiated and have higher levels of the nerve growth factor receptor). The endogenous IRR could also be detected in a neuroblastoma cell line (called IMR-5 cells). In these cells, IRR could be shown to be partly present as a hybrid with the insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I receptors but not with the receptor for nerve growth factor. The intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of this endogenous IRR was activated by the agonist monoclonal antibody to IRR but not by nerve growth factor, insulin-like growth factor I, or insulin. Finally, this monoclonal antibody was found to stimulate mitogen-activated protein kinase activity in these cells. In summary, these studies demonstrate for the first time that the IRR protein is normally expressed, that its levels are highest in neuronal tissues, and that it can form hybrid receptors with the two other members of this receptor family but not with the more distantly related nerve growth factor receptor.
8710868	Wild-type and mutant p53 differentially regulate transcription of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor gene.	The insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-I-R) plays a critical role in transformation events. It is highly overexpressed in most malignant tissues where it functions as an anti-apoptotic agent by enhancing cell survival. Tumor suppressor p53 is a nuclear transcription factor that blocks cell cycle progression and induces apoptosis. p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer. Cotransfection of Saos-2 (os-teosarcoma-derived cells) and RD (rhabdomyosarcoma-derived cells) cells with IGF-I-R promoter constructs driving luciferase reporter genes and with wild-type p53 expression vectors suppressed promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. This effect of p53 is mediated at the level of transcription and it involves interaction with TBP, the TATA box-binding component of TFIID. On the other hand, three tumor-derived mutant forms of p53 (mut 143, mut 248, and mut 273) stimulated the activity of the IGF-I-R promoter and increased the levels of IGF-I-R/luciferase fusion mRNA. These results suggest that wild-type p53 has the potential to suppress the IGF-I-R promoter in the postmitotic, fully differentiated cell, thus resulting in low levels of receptor gene expression in adult tissues. Mutant versions of p53 protein, usually associated with malignant states, can derepress the IGF-I-R promoter, with ensuing mitogenic activation by locally produced or circulating IGFs.
10026153	C-terminal Src kinase associates with ligand-stimulated insulin-like growth factor-I receptor.	Increased expression of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) protein-tyrosine kinase occurs in several kinds of cancer and induces neoplastic transformation in fibroblast cell lines. The transformed phenotype can be reversed by interfering with the function of the IGF-IR. The IGF-IR is required for transformation by a number of viral and cellular oncoproteins, including SV40 large T antigen, Ras, Raf, and Src. The IGF-IR is a substrate for Src in vitro and is phosphorylated in v-Src-transformed cells. We observed that the IGF-IR and IR associated with the C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) following ligand stimulation. We found that the SH2 domain of CSK binds to the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of IGF-IR and IR. We determined the tyrosine residues in the IGF-IR and in the IR responsible for this interaction. We also observed that fibroblasts stimulated with IGF-I or insulin showed a rapid and transient decrease in c-Src tyrosine kinase activity. The results suggest that c-Src and CSK are involved in IGF-IR and IR signaling and that the interaction of CSK with the IGF-IR may play a role in the decrease in c-Src activity following IGF-I stimulation.
10934810	Associations between lipoprotein lipase gene polymorphisms and insulin resistance in coronary heart disease.	BACKGROUND: Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a crucial enzyme in plasma lipoprotein metabolism. Variants of the LPL gene (Pvu II and Hind III polymorphisms) may increase the risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) but their effect on insulin resistance remains unknown. The present study was conducted to examine whether DNA variations of the LPL gene were related to insulin resistance, carbohydrate and lipid risk factors for CHD in nondiabetic individuals. METHODS: Pvu II and Hind III allele status of the LPL gene and fasting plasma glucose, insulin and lipid values were determined in nondiabetic men with angiographically documented CHD (n = 102) and in a control group (n = 145). Plasma glucose and insulin responses to a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test and insulin resistance as measured by an insulin suppression test were also carried out in 46 (45%) of the patients with CHD and in 73 (50%) of the control individuals. RESULTS: The allele frequencies of LPL Pvu II and Hind III were not significantly different between the CHD patients and the controls. No association was found between Pvu II status and blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, insulin, lipid levels or insulin resistance in patients with CHD. Nevertheless, compared with individuals with the Hind III H2H2 allele, CHD patients carrying the H1 allele (H1H1 + H1H2) were more insulin resistant, as indicated by higher steady state plasma glucose concentrations (253 +/- 87 vs 200 +/- 74 mg/dl, p = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the LPL gene Hind III allele might be associated with insulin resistance in nondiabetic men with CHD. However, further studies with larger populations of both sexes will be required to confirm this finding.
11160039	Differential effects of exercise on insulin-signaling gene expression in human skeletal muscle.	Skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity is enhanced after acute exercise and short-term endurance training. We investigated the impact of exercise on the gene expression of key insulin-signaling proteins in humans. Seven untrained subjects (4 women and 3 men) completed 9 days of cycling at 63 +/- 2% of peak O(2) uptake for 60 min/day. Muscle biopsies were taken before, immediately after, and 3 h after the exercise bouts (on days 1 and 9). The gene expression of insulin receptor substrate-2 and the p85 alpha subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was significantly higher 3 h after a single exercise bout, although short-term training ameliorated this effect. Gene expression of insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 was not significantly altered at any time point. These results suggest that exercise may have a transitory impact on the expression of insulin receptor substrate-2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; however, the predominant actions of exercise on insulin sensitivity appear not to reside in the transcriptional activation of the genes encoding major insulin-signaling proteins.
11238294	Compound heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 produce exaggerated hypercholesterolemia.	BACKGROUND: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 (FDB) represent ligand-receptor disorders that are complementary. Individuals with both FH and FDB are unusual. We report a family with both disorders and the impact of the mutations on the phenotypes of the family members. METHODS: We used single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) for genetic analysis of all 18 exons and the promoter region of the LDL receptor and DGGE for genetic analysis of the apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B-100) gene. The functional significance of the apo B-100 mutation was studied using a U937 cell proliferation assay. Fasting serum lipid profiles were determined for the index case and seven first-degree relatives. RESULTS: One of the patient's sisters had a missense mutation (Asp(407)-->Lys) in exon 9 of the LDL receptor and a serum LDL-cholesterol concentration of 4.07 mmol/L. Four other first-degree relatives had hyperlipidemia but no LDL-receptor mutation. However, these subjects had a mutation of the apo B-100 gene (Arg(3500)-->Trp). The cell proliferation rate of U937 cells fed with LDL from other subjects with the same mutation was fourfold less than that of controls. The index case had both FH- and FDB-related mutations. Her serum LDL-cholesterol (9.47 mmol/L) was higher than all other relatives tested. CONCLUSIONS: Existence of both FH and FDB should be considered in families with LDL-receptor mutations in some but not all individuals with hypercholesterolemia or when some individuals in families with FH exhibit exaggerated hypercholesterolemia.
12019173	Development of a highly specialized cDNA array for the study and diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer.	"Ovarian cancer is a major cause of cancer death in women. Unfortunately, the molecular pathways underlying ovarian cancer progression are poorly understood, making the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies difficult. On the basis of our previous observations obtained from serial analysis of gene expression, we have constructed a specialized cDNA array for the study of ovarian cancer. Small, specialized arrays have several practical advantages and can reveal information that is lost in the ""noise"" generated by irrelevant genes present in larger arrays. The array, which we named Ovachip, contains 516 cDNAs chosen from our serial analysis of gene expression and cDNA array studies for their relevance to ovarian cancer. The gene expression patterns revealed with the Ovachip are highly reproducible and extremely consistent among the different ovarian specimens tested. This array was extremely sensitive at differentiating ovarian cancer from colon cancer based on expression profiles. The Ovachip revealed clusters of coordinately expressed genes in ovarian cancer. One such cluster, the IGF2 cluster, is particularly striking and includes the insulin-like growth factor II, the cisplatin resistance-associated protein, the checkpoint suppressor 1, the cyclin-dependent kinase 6, and a protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor. We also identified a cluster of down-regulated genes that included the cyclin-dependent kinase 7 and cyclin H. Thus, the Ovachip allowed us to identify previously unidentified clusters of differentially expressed genes that may provide new paradigms for molecular pathways important in ovarian malignancies. Because of the relevance of the arrayed genes, the Ovachip may become a powerful tool for investigators in the field of ovarian cancer and may facilitate progress in understanding the etiology of this disease and in its clinical management."
7909276	Platelet-derived growth factor-induced expression of messenger RNA for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen requires a functional receptor for the insulin-like growth factor I.	Stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts or fibroblast-like cells with growth factors causes a sharp increase in the mRNA levels of several DNA synthesis genes. With most of these genes, the increase in mRNA levels requires at least 2 growth factors [usually platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)], but the mRNA of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) gene is induced by PDGF only. Since PDGF is known to induce also expression of IGF-I and its receptor, we inquired as to whether the PCNA mRNA induction by PDGF depended on a functional IGF autocrine loop. Using R- cells, i.e., mouse embryo cells in which the IGF-I receptor genes have been disrupted by homologous recombination, we show here that the functional integrity of the IGF-I receptor is obligatory for the PDGF-induced increase in PCNA mRNA levels. However, PCNA pre-mRNA levels are increased by PDGF even in the absence of the IGF-I receptor. These experiments confirm the importance of the IGF-I receptor in the control of cellular proliferation in animal cells, and suggest that one of its functions may be in the processing of certain pre-mRNAs required for orderly cell cycle progression.
8557683	The transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase CD45 is associated with decreased insulin receptor signaling.	Overexpression of the transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) CD45 in nonhematopoietic cells results in decreased signaling through growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. Consistent with these data, insulin receptor signaling is increased when the CD45-related PTPase LAR is reduced by antisense suppression in a rat hepatoma cell line. To test whether the hematopoietic cell-specific PTPase CD45 functions in a manner similar to LAR by negatively modulating insulin receptor signaling in hematopoietic cells, the insulin-responsive human multiple myeloma cell line U266 was isolated into two subpopulations that differed in CD45 expression. In CD45 nonexpressing (CD45-) cells, insulin receptor autophosphorylation was increased by 3-fold after insulin treatment when compared to CD45 expressing (CD45+) cells. This increase in receptor autophosphorylation was associated with similar increases in insulin-dependent tyrosine kinase activation. These receptor level effects were paralleled by postreceptor responses. Insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and Shc was 3-fold greater in CD45- cells. In addition, insulin-dependent IRS-1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase association and MAP kinase activation in CD45- cells were also 3-fold larger. While expression of CD45 was associated with a decrease in the responsiveness of early insulin receptor signaling, interleukin 6-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase was equivalent between CD45- and CD45+ cells. These observations indicate that CD45 can function as a negative modulator of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases in addition to its well-established role as an activator of src family tyrosine kinases.
8626706	Insulin-like growth factor expression in human cancer cell lines.	The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), IGF-I and IGF-II, are potent mitogens for human lung and other epithelial cancer cell lines. Previous studies in defined medium lacking added IGF or insulin suggest that an IGF-related ligand can act as an autocrine growth factor for many cancer cell lines through action via the type I IGF receptor (IGF-R). Analysis of RNA isolated from human lung and breast cancer cell lines by reverse transcription of mRNA and polymerase chain reaction reveal that IGF-I and IGF-II mRNAs were co-expressed with IGF-R in the majority of cell lines. IGF-I mRNA was detected in 11/12 small cell lung cancer cell lines (SCLC), 13/14 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, and 1/2 breast cancer cell lines. IGF-II mRNA was detected in 8/10 SCLC, 11/12 NSCLC cell lines, and 2/2 breast lines. All cell lines expressed IGF-R. For analysis of IGF peptide secretion, cell lines were adapted to growth in serum/hormone-free culture medium (R0), and to avoid interference by IGF-binding proteins, secreted IGF peptides were isolated under acidic conditions and analyzed by Western blotting. Based upon measurement of the sensitivity of the anti-IGF antibodies for detection of recombinant human IGFs, IGF peptides accumulated in conditioned medium at greater than picomolar concentrations should have been readily detected. In three cell lines (two lung and one breast) secreted IGF immunoreactivity was detected as three molecular mass species of 23, 14, and 6 kDa. Isolation and NH2-terminal sequencing of each of these species definitively identified them as differentially processed forms of the IGF-II prohormone. Despite the high frequency of IGF-I gene expression detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, only one lung cancer cell line, NCI-N417d, was found that unequivocally secreted IGF-I peptide. This direct sequence determination unambiguously identifies IGF-II as the predominant IGF involved in the autocrine growth stimulation of human lung and breast epithelial tumor cell lines and supports a growing body of literature that implicates IGF-II/IGF-R autocrine loops as a common growth mechanism in epithelial carcinogenesis.
9699666	A dominant negative mutant of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor inhibits the adhesion, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer.	The 5-year survival rate for women with metastatic breast cancer is only 25-30%; thus, the need to improve treatment is apparent. Overexpression of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) correlates with poor prognosis and local recurrence. In this study, we addressed whether functional impairment of IGF-IR affects adhesion, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. Impairment of IGF-IR function was achieved by transfecting a dominant negative form of the receptor, termed 486stop, into MDA-MB-435 metastatic breast cancer cells. The protein product of 486stop is secreted extracellularly, resulting in a bystander effect. Cellular adhesion to laminin and collagen was inhibited 94 and 88%, respectively. Furthermore, 486stop inhibited insulin-like growth factor-I-stimulated invasion through collagen IV by 75%. The dominant negative receptor was secreted, as evidenced by the observation that MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 cells were prevented from binding to laminin by 90% when treated with conditioned medium (CM) from 486stop-transfected cells. CM also inhibited the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells across collagen IV by 80%. Finally, CM made MDA-MB-231 cells 30% more sensitive to Taxol-induced cell death. Growth in soft agar was suppressed by 486stop, but growth in monolayer was unaffected. When injected into the mammary fat pad, 486stop did not significantly suppress growth of the primary tumor, but metastasis to the lungs, livers, lymph nodes, and lymph vessels was significantly decreased compared to the vector control. In conclusion, inhibition of IGF-IR resulted in suppression of adhesion, invasion, and metastasis, providing a mechanistic rationale for targeting IGF-IR in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
10065165	Insulin-like growth factors in endometrial function.	Growth factors and related peptides are believed to mediate and modulate the actions of hormones at their target tissues through autocrine/paracrine mechanisms. Endometrial stromal cells produce insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II) as well as the high-affinity IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs), whereas epithelial cells and, in a lesser amount, also stromal cells contain cell membrane receptors for IGFs. IGFs have proliferative, differentiative and metabolic effects. Estrogen stimulates IGF-I gene expression in the endometrium, and IGF-I is assumed to mediate estrogen action. IGF-II gene expression is associated with endometrial differentiation. All six high-affinity IGFBPs are expressed in human endometrium, the most abundant being IGFBP-1. This is secreted by predecidualized/decidualized endometrial stromal cells in late secretory phase endometrium and pregnancy decidua, i.e. under the action of progesterone. The primary negative regulator of IGFBP-1 expression is insulin, by inhibiting IGFBP-1 transcription. IGFBP-1 inhibits the receptor binding and biological actions of IGF-I in the endometrium and in cultured human trophoblastic cells. These findings support the view that the IGF system has autocrine and paracrine functions in the regulation of endometrial proliferation and differentiation. After implantation, decidual IGFBP-1 may regulate IGF actions at the embryo-endometrial interface, since trophoblast cells contain IGF receptors and express IGF-II, but do not express IGFBP-1. Clinical conditions that are known to increase the risk of endometrial cancer are all characterized by the absence of IGFBP-1. Thus, like unopposed estrogen, unopposed IGF-I action may also lead to uncontrolled endometrial proliferation and favor the development of endometrial cancer. The measurement of mRNAs encoding the IGF system might provide a novel tool to evaluate the endometrial response to endogenous and exogenous estrogens and progestins at the molecular level.
10791773	Crosstalk between the insulin-like growth factors and estrogens in breast cancer.	Once it was recognized that breast tumor growth was stimulated by estrogens, successful therapeutic strategies based on depriving the tumor of this hormone were developed. Since the growth stimulatory properties of the estrogens are governed by the estrogen receptor (ER), understanding the mechanisms that activate ER are highly relevant. In addition to estrogens, peptide growth factors can also activate the ER. The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are potent mitogens for ER-positive breast cancer cell lines. This review will examine the evidence for interaction between these two pathways. The IGFs can activate the ER, while ER transcriptionally regulates genes required for IGF action. Moreover, blockade of ER function can inhibit IGF-mediated mitogenesis and interruption of IGF action can similarly inhibit estrogenic stimulation of breast cancer cells. Taken together, these observations suggest that the two growth regulatory pathways are tightly linked and that a further understanding of the mechanism of this crosstalk could lead to new therapeutic strategies in breast cancer.
11577168	IGFs and IGFBPs: surrogate markers for diagnosis and surveillance of tumour growth?	Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), IGF receptors, and IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) constitute the IGF system. Comprehensive data indicate that these factors play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis. Epidemiological data indicate that cancer risk is associated with high serum IGF-I values. Because dysregulation of the IGF system is a frequent pattern in malignancy, IGFs/IGFBPs might represent novel tumour markers that could be useful both for diagnosis and surveillance.
12115549	A sequence repeat in the insulin-like growth factor-1 gene and risk of breast cancer.	Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I), a potent mitogen, is hypothesized to influence breast cancer risk. In 3 previous studies, a polymorphism in the IGF-1 gene (sequence repeat length) was associated with plasma IGF-I level. We evaluated prospectively the relationships among a (CA)(n) repeat polymorphism in the IGF-1 gene, IGF-I level and breast cancer risk in a nested case-control study conducted within the Nurses' Health Study. Blood samples were collected in 1989-1990; up to June 1994, we identified 463 cases of breast cancer. One to 2 controls were selected per case, matched by age, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, month and time of day of blood collection and fasting status, for a total of 622 controls. Although no significant trend was observed, plasma IGF-I levels were significantly lower among controls, with no copy of the 19 allele, compared with those homozygous for the 19 (CA)(n) repeat length (146 and 173 ng/ml, respectively; p-value for pairwise mean comparison = 0.005). In conditional logistic regression, controlling for established breast cancer risk factors, we observed no significant association between (CA)(n) repeat length genotype and risk of breast cancer [compared with repeat genotype 19/19-18/19 genotype relative risk (RR) = 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.56-1.64; 18/20 genotype RR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.39-2.19; 19/20 genotype RR = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.82-1.64; 19/21 genotype RR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.42-1.14; 20/20 genotype RR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.28-1.10; 20/21 genotype RR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.29-1.79]. Results did not vary substantially when evaluated according to menopausal status, tumor receptor status or category of other breast cancer risk factors. Although a modest association cannot be excluded, our data do not support an important relation between this IGF-1 gene polymorphism and breast cancer risk.
9056422	Overexpressed IGF-I receptors reduce estrogen growth requirements, enhance survival, and promote E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in human breast cancer cells.	The insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) paracrine or autocrine loop plays an important role in the maintenance of breast cancer growth. Cancer cells contain several-fold higher levels of the IGF-IR than normal breast tissue; however, it is still not clear whether abnormally high activation of IGF-IR signaling may induce progression of the disease. To address this question, we have established several MCF-7-derived clones (MCF-7/IGF-IR cells) overexpressing the IGF-IR. We report here that overexpression of the IGF-IR did not modify sensitivity of cells to IGF-I; however, responsiveness to the ligand was moderately enhanced in most of the MCF-7/IGF-IR clones (measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA). All MCF-7/IGF-IR clones responded to the synergistic action of 1 nM estradiol (E2) and small amounts of IGF-I (up to 0.8 ng/ml). Exposure of cells to higher concentrations of IGF-I abolished estrogen requirements for stimulation of DNA synthesis in all MCF-7/IGF-IR clones, but not in the parental cells. The most important finding of this work was that the amplification of the IGF-IR induced cell-cell adhesion in MCF-7 cells. High levels of the IGF-IR promoted cell aggregation on Matrigel, allowed proliferation of cells within the aggregates, and protected clustered cells from death. In both MCF-7 and MCF-7/IGF-IR cells, IGF-I stimulated aggregation, whereas an anti-E cadherin antibody blocked cell-cell adhesion. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining with specific antibodies revealed co-localization of the IGF-IR and E-cadherin at the points of cell-cell contacts. Moreover, the IGF-IR and its two substrates, insulin receptor substrate 1 and SHC, were contained within the E-cadherin complexes. Our results suggest that overexpressed IGF-IRs, by promoting the aggregation, growth, and survival of breast cancer cells, may accelerate the increase of tumor mass and may also prevent cell scattering.
9568749	Influence of polymorphism Q3405E and mutation A3371V in the apolipoprotein B gene on LDL receptor binding.	Familial defective apolipoprotein B (FDB) is due to mutations in the apolipoprotein B (apo B) gene at codon 3500 or 3531 that affect low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor binding. From sequence analysis the putative receptor binding site was believed originally to be upstream from this at residues 3147-3157 and 3357-3367. Using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, mutations were sought in codons 3350-3466. This includes the important positively charged residues 3357-3367. DNA from 928 hyperlipidaemic individuals was studied and two hitherto unknown DNA changes were discovered, one of which resulted in an altered amino acid in the apo B. A known polymorphism Q3405E was also detected at a carrier frequency of 1.4%. Using growth of U937 cells as a measure of binding affinity of LDL to its receptor the newly discovered mutant A3371V permitted the same growth as LDL from normolipidaemic individuals of the U937 cells, however, the LDL from Q3405E individuals permitted only 77% of the normal growth (P=0.009).
9605931	Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins IRS-1 and IRS-2 differential signaling in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I pathways in fetal brown adipocytes.	In the present study we have investigated the contribution of the insulin receptor substrate proteins (IRS-1 and IRS-2) to the insulin/insulin like growth factor I (IGF-I)-signaling pathways in fetal rat brown adipocytes, a model that expresses both insulin and IGF-I receptors. Insulin/IGF-I rapidly stimulated IRS-1 and IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, their association with p85alpha, and IRS-1- and IRS-2-associated phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activation to the same extent, the effect of insulin being stronger than the effect of IGF-I at the same physiological dose (10 nM). Furthermore, insulin/IGF-I stimulated IRS-1-associated Grb-2 phosphorylation. However, IRS-2-associated Grb-2 phosphorylation was barely detected. Pull-down experiments with glutathione-S-transferase-fusion proteins containing SH2-domains of p85alpha revealed a strong association between IRS-1 and IRS-2 with p85alpha in response to insulin/IGF-I, the insulin effect being stronger than IGF-I. However, the Grb-2-SH2 domain showed functional differences. While a strong association between IRS-1/Grb-2 was found, IRS-2/Grb-2 association was virtually absent in response to insulin/IGF-I, as also demonstrated in competition studies with a phosphopeptide containing the phosphotyrosine 895 residue within the putative Grb-2-binding domain. Finally, insulin/IGF-I stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the three SHC proteins (46, 52, and 66 kDa). Moreover, insulin/IGF-I markedly increased the amount of Grb-2-associated SHC proteins by the same extent. Our results suggest that both IRS-1 and IRS-2 are required for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation that leads to adipogenic and thermogenic differentiation of fetal brown adipose tissue; meanwhile, IRS-1 and SHC, but not IRS-2, associate with Grb-2 leading to the ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase-signaling pathway required for fetal brown adipocyte proliferation.
9885576	The C. elegans PTEN homolog, DAF-18, acts in the insulin receptor-like metabolic signaling pathway.	An insulin-like signaling pathway, from the DAF-2 receptor, the AGE-1 phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and the AKT-1/AKT-2 serine/threonine kinases to the DAF-16 Fork head transcription factor, regulates the metabolism, development, and life span of Caenorhabditis elegans. Inhibition of daf-18 gene activity bypasses the normal requirement for AGE-1 and partially bypasses the need for DAF-2 signaling. The suppression of age-1 mutations by a daf-18 mutation depends on AKT-1/AKT-2 signaling, showing that DAF-18 acts between AGE-1 and the AKT input to DAF-16 transcriptional regulation. daf-18 encodes a homolog of the human tumor suppressor PTEN (MMAC1/TEP1), which has 3-phosphatase activity toward phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). DAF-18 PTEN may normally limit AKT-1 and AKT-2 activation by decreasing PIP3 levels. The action of daf-18 in this metabolic control pathway suggests that mammalian PTEN may modulate insulin signaling and may be variant in diabetic pedigrees.
10791772	Function of the IGF-I receptor in breast cancer.	The insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase regulating various biological processes such as proliferation, survival, transformation, differentiation, cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions. Different signaling pathways may underlie these pleiotropic effects. The specific pathways engaged depend on the number of activated IGF-IRs, availability of intracellular signal transducers, the action of negative regulators, and is influenced by extracellular modulators. Experimental and clinical data implicate the IGF-IR in breast cancer etiology. There is strong evidence linking hyperactivation of the IGF-IR with the early stages of breast cancer. In primary breast tumors, the IGF-IR is overexpressed and hyperphosphorylated, which correlates with radio-resistance and tumor recurrence. In vitro, the IGF-IR is often required for mitogenesis and transformation, and its overexpression or activation counteract effects of various pro-apoptotic treatments. In hormone-responsive breast cancer cells, IGF-IR function is strongly linked with estrogen receptor (ER) action. The IGF-IR and the ER are co-expressed in breast tumors. Moreover, estrogens stimulate the expression of the IGF-IR and its major signaling substrate IRS-1, while antiestrogens downregulate IGF-IR signaling, mainly by decreasing IRS-1 expression and function. On the other hand, overexpression of IRS-1 promotes estrogen-independence for growth and transformation. In ER-negative breast cancer cells, usually displaying a more aggressive phenotype, the levels of the IGF-IR and IRS-1 are often low and IGF is not mitogenic, yet the IGF-IR is still required for metastatic spread. Consequently, IGF-IR function in the late stages of breast cancer remains one of the most important questions to be addressed before rational anti-IGF-IR therapies are developed.
12509421	Severe hypercholesterolemia, impaired fat tolerance, and advanced atherosclerosis in mice lacking both low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 and apolipoprotein E.	LDL receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) plays multiple roles, including embryonic development and bone accrual development. Recently, we demonstrated that LRP5 is also required for normal cholesterol metabolism and glucose-induced insulin secretion. To further define the role of LRP5 in the lipoprotein metabolism, we compared plasma lipoproteins in mice lacking LRP5, apolipoprotein E (apoE), or both (apoE;LRP5 double knockout). On a normal chow diet, the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice (older than 4 months of age) had approximately 60% higher plasma cholesterol levels compared with the age-matched apoE knockout mice. In contrast, LRP5 deficiency alone had no significant effects on the plasma cholesterol levels. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of plasma lipoproteins revealed that cholesterol levels in the very low density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein fractions were markedly increased in the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice. There were no apparent differences in the pattern of apoproteins between the apoE knockout mice and the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice. The plasma clearance of intragastrically loaded triglyceride was markedly impaired by LRP5 deficiency. The atherosclerotic lesions of the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice aged 6 months were approximately 3-fold greater than those in the age-matched apoE-knockout mice. Furthermore, histological examination revealed highly advanced atherosclerosis, with remarkable accumulation of foam cells and destruction of the internal elastic lamina in the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice. These data suggest that LRP5 mediates both apoE-dependent and apoE-independent catabolism of plasma lipoproteins.
14530378	Effective destruction of Fas-deficient insulin-producing beta cells in type 1 diabetes.	In type 1 diabetes, autoimmune T cells cause destruction of pancreatic beta cells by largely unknown mechanism. Previous analyses have shown that beta cell destruction is delayed but can occur in perforin-deficient nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice and that Fas-deficient NOD mice do not develop diabetes. However, because of possible pleiotropic functions of Fas, it was not clear whether the Fas receptor was an essential mediator of beta cell death in type 1 diabetes. To directly test this hypothesis, we have generated a beta cell-specific knockout of the Fas gene in a transgenic model of type 1 autoimmune diabetes in which CD4+ T cells with a transgenic TCR specific for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) are causing diabetes in mice that express HA under control of the rat insulin promoter. Here we show that the Fas-deficient mice develop autoimmune diabetes with slightly accelerated kinetics indicating that Fas-dependent apoptosis of beta cells is a dispensable mode of cell death in this disease.
8178058	[Genetics of autoimmune diseases].	"Strategies for studying the genetics of autoimmune diseases have undergone a considerable evolution during the last years, especially due to molecular biology techniques and to systematic genome studies. Genetic factors account for 20 to 40% of the risk, and environmental elements play a major role. The major histocompatibility complex comprising HLA genes remains the immunogenetic system most studied and most closely associated with various autoimmune diseases. These associations are mainly observed with HLA class II genes polymorphisms; the precise knowledge of their structure has allowed to define HLA sequence polymorphisms which are themselves risk markers: specific combinations of HLA-DQA and DQB alleles in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or a given DR, DQ haplotype for multiple sclerosis. No strong association with HLA-DP has been demonstrated. In all cases the genes involved have a normal structure and the disease is secondary to the combination of a given set of genes with environmental factors. The present knowledge of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and multiple sclerosis genetics is rather advanced. Other genes of the HLA region might also be involved in the genetic susceptibility. Results about other immunogenetic systems (T cell receptor genes or heavy chain immunoglobulin genes) are still contradictory but no major gene for autoimmune susceptibility seems to exist in these regions; however autoimmune diseases are under polygenic control; susceptibility genes shared between different diseases often occurring within the same families (Graves' disease and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) and genes specific for a given disease (insulin gene region in diabetes) both exist. The present rapid progress in this area is due to the use of highly polymorphic markers randomly distributed across the genome (microsatellites being most informative) and that of animal models: the list of ""candidate genes or regions"" potentially involved in the genetics of autoimmune diseases is enlarging; the development of coordinated epidemiological studies of molecular genetics along with the sharing of biological resources between different teams allow to build up powerful informative studies which will confirm or refute those ""candidates"". However, once the list of genes involved is established their mechanism of action will still take time to elucidate."
9332364	Disrupted cholecystokinin type-A receptor (CCKAR) gene in OLETF rats.	OLETF rats develop hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and mild obesity, which is characteristic of human non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). We cloned and sequenced the cholecystokinin type-A receptor (CCKAR) gene in the rats. Comparing the DNA sequences of the OLETF CCKAR gene and LETO CCKAR gene, normal gene, we found a deletion in the OLETF gene, 6847 bases in length, which was flanked by two 3-base-pair direct repeats (5'-TGT-3') at positions -2407/-2405 and 4441/4443, numbered according to the LETO gene sequence, one of which was lost. The promoter region, the first and second exons were missing in the mutant. The region upstream and downstream of the deletion, including exons 3, 4 and 5, was conserved between the two strains, and did not contain any base changes. We found that the gene mapped to chromosome 14 in rats. OLETF rats are the naturally occurring knockout animals with the homozygously disrupted CCKAR gene.
12183434	Proinflammatory cytokines block growth of breast cancer cells by impairing signals from a growth factor receptor.	Neutralization of endogenous growth factors and administration of exogenous bioactive cytokines are two distinct biological antitumor strategies that show promise for treatment of cancer patients. In this report, we provide evidence to link both strategies as an integrative approach to cancer therapy. We tested the hypothesis that proinflammatory cytokines block growth of transformed cells by inhibiting key intracellular signaling events after activation of the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) tyrosine kinase receptor. IGF-I stimulates DNA synthesis in MCF-7 cells by 15-fold. This increase is significantly inhibited by TNF (tumor necrosis factor) -alpha at 0.1 ng/ml and is reduced by 80% at 100 ng/ml. Similarly, both IL (interleukin) -1beta and IL-6 significantly reduce the ability of IGF-I to promote DNA synthesis. Flow cytometry confirmed that all three of the cytokines inhibit IGF-I-induced DNA synthesis by preventing cells from entering the S phase of the cell cycle, leading to G(0)/G(1) arrest. Although none of the cytokines alone are cytotoxic to transformed epithelial cells in the absence of serum, TNF-alpha significantly inhibits the antiapoptotic property of IGF-I in protecting MCF-7 cells from DNA fragmentation. TNF-alpha and IL-1beta act by inhibiting the IGF-I receptor from tyrosine phosphorylating insulin receptor substrate-1 without affecting tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR itself. These data support the novel idea that the major inhibitory properties of proinflammatory cytokines on growth of breast cancer cells are manifested prominently in the presence of growth factors. These data also highlight growth factor receptor adaptor molecules, such as insulin receptor substrate-1, rather than the receptors themselves as targets for antitumor therapeutic strategies.
12767520	The insulin-like growth factor system and cancer.	The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) family of ligands, binding proteins and receptors is an important growth factor system involved in both the development of the organism and the maintenance of normal function of many cells of the body. The system also has powerful anti-apoptotic effects. More recently, evidence has accrued to demonstrate that the IGFs play an important role in cancer. Individuals with serum IGF-II levels in the upper quartile of the normal range (and IGF binding protein-3 levels in the lower quartiles) have a relative risk for developing breast, prostate, colon and lung cancer. IGF-II is commonly expressed by tumor cells and may act as an autocrine growth factor; occasionally even reaching target tissues and causing tumor-induced hypoglycemia. The IGF-I receptor is commonly (though not always) overexpressed in many cancers, and many recent studies have identified new signaling pathways emanating from the IGF-I receptor that affect cancer cell proliferation, adhesion, migration and cell death; functions that are critical for cancer cell survival and metastases. In this review, many aspects of the IGF system and its relationship to cancer will be discussed.
8603394	Reduced growth of human breast cancer xenografts in hosts homozygous for the lit mutation.	Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is a potent breast cancer mitogen. Growth hormone (GH) up-regulates hepatic IGF-I gene expression and circulating IGF-I level. Tissue IGF bioactivity is influenced not only by circulating IGF-I and IGF-II levels but also by autocrine and paracrine production of these growth factors and by IGF binding proteins. There is considerable person-to-person variability in GH-IGF-I physiology. Both laboratory and epidemiological data are consistent with the hypothesis that the host GH-IGF-I axis influences breast cancer behavior, but such an effect has not been directly demonstrated. To determine whether breast cancer growth in an in vivo model is influenced by the host GH-IGF-I axis, we compared the growth of human MCF-7 breast cancer cells in control mice to that in mice homozygous for lit, a missense mutation resulting in loss of function of the pituitary GH-releasing hormone receptor and secondary suppression of GH and IGF-I. Breast cancer growth was significantly reduced in lit/lit animals compared to control hosts [tumor size (mean +/- SD) on day 39,444 +/- 82 versus 845 +/- 444 mm3, respectively; P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test]. These data demonstrate that in our model, host GH-IGF-I axis physiology plays a role in determining breast cancer behavior. The results a) suggest that patient-to-patient variability in GH-IGF-I physiology may contribute to the large variability between patients regarding breast cancer behavior, and b) motivate clinical trials of novel hormonal treatment strategies that target the GH-IGF-I axis.
9664082	Obesity and diabetes in TNF-alpha receptor- deficient mice.	TNF-alpha may play a role in mediating insulin resistance associated with obesity. This concept is based on studies of obese rodents and humans, and cell culture models. TNF elicits cellular responses via two receptors called p55 and p75. Our purpose was to test the involvement of TNF in glucose homeostasis using mice lacking one or both TNF receptors. C57BL/6 mice lacking p55 (p55(-)/-), p75, (p75(-)/-), or both receptors (p55(-)/-p75(-)/-) were fed a high-fat diet to induce obesity. Marked fasting hyperinsulinemia was seen for p55(-)/-p75(-)/- males between 12 and 16 wk of feeding the high-fat diet. Insulin levels were four times greater than wild-type mice. In contrast, p55(-)/- and p75(-)/- mice exhibited insulin levels that were similar or reduced, respectively, as compared with wild-type mice. In addition, high-fat diet-fed p75(-)/- mice had the lowest body weights and leptin levels, and improved insulin sensitivity. Obese (db/db) mice, which are not responsive to leptin, were used to study the role of p55 in severe obesity. Male p55(-)/-db/db mice exhibited threefold higher insulin levels and twofold lower glucose levels at 20 wk of age than control db/db expressing p55. All db/db mice remained severely insulin resistant based on fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels, and glucose and insulin tolerance tests. Our data do not support the concept that TNF, acting via its receptors, is a major contributor to obesity-associated insulin resistance. In fact, data suggest that the two TNF receptors work in concert to protect against diabetes.
10446958	BRCA2 is required for ionizing radiation-induced assembly of Rad51 complex in vivo.	Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for the majority of familial breast cancers. Cells with mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation (IR) and exhibit defective DNA repair. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been reported to bind Rad51, a protein essential for homologous recombination and the recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks. In normal cells, a redistribution of Rad51 protein, manifested as formation of Rad51 nuclear foci, is seen upon IR treatment. Here we demonstrate that IR-induced Rad51 foci formation is aberrant in BRCA2- but not BRCA1-deficient tumor cells. In Capan-1 cells, which do not express functional BRCA2, there was little Rad51 foci formation in response to a wide range of radiation dosages. Moreover, forced expression of a fusion protein containing green fluorescent protein and the first Rad51-binding BRC repeat of BRCA2 in cells with wild-type BRCA2 rendered them hypersensitive to IR and cisplatin and compromised IR-induced Rad51 foci formation. In HCC1937 cells, which harbor mutation of BRCA1, IR-induced Rad51 foci were readily detected. This study suggests a requirement of BRCA2 protein for the IR-induced assembly of Rad51 complex in vivo.
11005099	[Detection of overexpression of insulin receptor gene in laryngeal carcinoma cells by using differential display method].	BACKGROUND: The insulin receptor (IR) is an essential protein localized on the surface of almost all cell types. IR belongs to the tyrosine-kinase growth factor receptor family. Insulin mediates proliferative responses in a variety of tumor cells, however, the role of the IR molecule in carcinogenesis has not yet exactly been established. METHODS: Messenger RNA from mucosal keratinocytes and laryngeal carcinoma cells were transcribed in cDNA using reverse transcriptase and amplified by PCR by means of a number of oligonucleotides. PCR products were analyzed electrophoretically. RESULTS: Comparing the electrophoretic pattern of both cell types the overexpression of a 127 bp fragment could be detected in laryngeal carcinoma cells in contrast to benign keratinocytes. Cloning and sequencing this fragment exact homologous match was found with exon-2 of the IR gene. The overexpression of the IR gene in laryngeal carcinoma cells was confirmed by Northern hybridization. CONCLUSIONS: The results show up-regulation of IR-mRNA in laryngeal carcinoma cells suggesting that the number of IR is enhanced in these cells. Hence it follows, that the overexpression of IR plays a possible role in laryngeal cancer initiation and/or progression.
12105987	IGF1 receptor expression protects against microenvironmental stress found in the solid tumor.	The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) is a tyrosine kinase, transmembrane receptor expressed in most body tissues and required for normal growth of cells. In cell culture, overexpression of the receptor has been shown to promote transformation and enhance cell survival in response to selected cytotoxic agents. As tumors develop, abnormalities in vascularization lead to a heterogeneous environment that includes areas of hypoxia, low pH and low glucose. Here we report that the overexpression of the IGF1R promotes increased survival in cells exposed to hypoxia, low pH and low glucose. Furthermore, cells lacking the receptor due to targeted disruption of the IGF1R gene do not survive as well as normal cells in such conditions. In addition, we find that cells can activate the IGF1R gene promoter in response to these conditions, and immunoblot analyses show increased receptor protein levels in cell exposed to hypoxia. Our results suggest a pathway of cancer cell adaptation to the tumor microenvironment in which conditions of the environment may induce expression of IGF1R, and this subsequent overexpression of the receptor may increase cell survival in such conditions.
12127559	Expression of insulin-like growth factors IGF-I and IGF-II, and their receptors during the growth and megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells.	Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) I and II are critical regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation and most of the growth promoting properties of both ligands are mediated by IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR). In the present study we have investigated the role of IGFs in K562 cell line during normal growth and 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced megakaryocytic differentiation. Abundant expression of IGF-I, IGF-II and IGF-IR was demonstrated in resting cells and exogenous IGF-I and IGF-II increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in a dose dependent manner. In contrast, we found that basal growth of the cells was inhibited by using anti-IGF-IR mAb. Furthermore, also IGF-I and IGF-II induced DNA synthesis was significantly suppressed by anti-IGF-IR mAb. During megakaryocytic differentiation, expression of IGF-IR increased during first 12h, but after that the expression started to decrease together with IGF-I. Taken together, our data suggest that autocrine production of IGF-I and IGF-II may via IGF-IR play a significant role in the growth and megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells.
12536716	[The molecular mechanism of high glucose-induced insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes].	We investigated the cellular effect of high glucose using 3T3-L1 adipocytes on glucose transport activity, the expression of insulin signaling proteins and IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Results showed that adipocytes treated with different high glucose (10, 15 and 25 mmol.L-1) for 24 hours showed to impair the basal and insulin-induced increase in glucose uptake in a dose-dependent manner and decreased significantly IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation. High concentration of glucose produced opposite effects on IRS1 and IRS2: down-regulated IRS1 protein expression level and tightly up-regulated IRS2 contents. p85 and PKB were unaffected. Chronic exposure to high glucose can inhibit glucose uptake and induce insulin resistance. The mechanism may be involved in affecting the expression of insulin signaling peptides and tyrosine phosphorylation.
7529048	The insulin-like growth factor I receptor gene is the target for the 15q26 amplicon in breast cancer.	We report the amplification and overexpression of the IGFIR (insulin-like growth factor I receptor) gene in primary breast cancers with an amplification of band 15q26. The involvement of IGFIR, which may vary in frequency from 2-3% in unselected tumor series to more than 10% in breast cancers with hsr, may represent an important event in tumor progression.
7949210	Effect of two-4-hydroxyandrostenedione doses on serum insulin-like growth factor I levels in advanced breast cancer.	A number of endocrine treatments for advanced breast cancer seem to affect serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). The aim of our study was to investigate IGF-I levels in 33 postmenopausal patients with metastatic disease receiving the selective aromatase inhibitor 4-hydroxyandrostenedione: 250 mg (16 patients) or 500 mg (17 patients) i.m. fortnightly. Blood samples were collected before, and at one month and 3 months after the beginning of treatment for radioimmunoassay determinations. The median patient age was 56 and 60 years in the 250 and 500 mg groups respectively. Most patients had a disease free interval > or = 2 years and were oestrogen receptor positive. Objective responses were obtained in 3 patients (complete response, 1) in the 250 mg group, and in 7 patients (complete response, 3) in the 500 mg group. No significant IGF-I variations were seen in the 250 mg group, whereas a significant increase after 3 months (181.57 +/- 84.78 ng/ml versus 272.47 +/- 213.22 ng/ml, p = 0.0032) was observed in the 500 mg group. No IGF-I variations were seen between responsive and unresponsive patients in either treatment group. Our results in the 500 mg group are close to those obtained with aminoglutethimide and seem to agree with the hypothesis of an oestrogen-induced suppression of IGF-I circulating levels.
10766344	Treatment of human breast cancer cells with antisense RNA to the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor inhibits cell growth, suppresses tumorigenesis, alters the metastatic potential, and prolongs survival in vivo.	The type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) plays an important role in the growth and transformation of breast cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of treatment with an antisense IGF-IR construct on cells from the highly metastatic estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-435s. The cells carrying the antisense IGF-IR had a markedly reduced expression of IGF-IR, had a significant decrease in cell proliferation, and lost the ability to form colonies in soft agar. There was a delay in tumor formation and a dramatic reduction in tumor size when cells carrying the antisense IGF-IR were injected into either nude or severe combined immunodeficient (scid) beige mice. We have also provided data that show that the scid beige mouse is a more suitable model for studying metastasis of the MDA-MB-435s cells. All of the scid beige mice injected with cells carrying the control construct had metastasis to the lungs, whereas lungs from the nude mice had no apparent metastatic sites after 11 weeks. When cells carrying antisense IGF-IR were injected subcutaneously in scid beige mice, the animals had a significant increase in survival compared with mice injected with cells carrying the control construct. Taken together, these results indicate that the IGF-IR can play a critical role in the progression of breast cancer. Our studies provide a basis for the development of future treatment strategies targeting the IGF-IR in metastatic breast cancer.
12915889	1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (calcitriol) and its analogue, 19-nor-1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(2), potentiate the effects of ionising radiation on human prostate cancer cells.	Radiotherapy with external beam radiation or brachytherapy is an established therapeutic modality for prostate cancer. Approximately 30% of patients with localised prostate cancer relapse at the irradiated site. Secondary effects of ionising radiation (IR), for example, bowel and bladder complications, are common. Thus, the search for biological response modifiers that could potentiate the therapeutic effects of radiation and limit the occurrence of serious side effects is an important task in prostate cancer therapy. 1alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (calcitriol), the active metabolite of vitamin D, and its analogues are under investigation for the treatment of several malignancies including prostate cancer. Here, we report that 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and its less calcaemic analogue 19-nor-1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(2) (Zemplar) act synergistically with IR to inhibit the growth of the human prostate cancer cells in vitro. 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) potentiated IR-induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells, and nanomolar doses of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and 19-nor-1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(2) showed synergistic inhibition of growth of LNCaP cells at radiobiologically relevant doses of IR (1-2 Gy). At higher doses of IR, the combination of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and IR or 19-nor-1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(2) and IR resulted in moderate antagonism. The synergistic effect at radiobiologically relevant doses of radiation suggests that a combination of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) or 19-nor-1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(2) with IR could permit a reduction in the dose of radiation given clinically and thus potentially reduce treatment-related morbidity.
8263133	Expression of insulin receptor spliced variants and their functional correlates in muscle from patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.	Due to alternative splicing of exon 11 of the receptor gene, the human insulin receptor exists in two forms, that have distinct tissue-specific expression and are functionally different. Needle biopsies obtained from vastus lateralis muscle from 20 patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and 20 normal control subjects were analyzed for the relative expression of insulin receptor mRNA variants in a novel assay using fluorescence-labeled primers and subsequent analysis on an automated DNA sequencer. In subgroups of patients and control subjects, insulin binding and tyrosine kinase activity were examined in wheat germ agglutinin-purified insulin receptors isolated from muscle biopsies. Moreover, insulin-stimulated glucose disposal was studied by means of the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. No difference in the relative expression of spliced variants of the insulin receptor mRNA was observed (control subjects, 71.4 +/- 1.3% insulin receptor mRNA with exon 11; NIDDM patients, 71.5 +/- 1.3% insulin receptor mRNA with exon 11). No significant interrelationships were demonstrated among the relative expression of insulin receptor mRNA variants, insulin binding, and tyrosine kinase activity toward the exogenous substrate poly(Glu-Tyr(4:1)). Furthermore, no significant relationship was demonstrated between the glucose disposal rate and the relative expression of insulin receptor splice variants. In conclusion, in skeletal muscle from both normal control subjects and NIDDM patients, the proportion of insulin receptor mRNA with exon 11 is about 70%. In addition, no significant correlations exist among insulin binding, insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity, glucose disposal rate, and expression of alternative spliced insulin receptors in human skeletal muscle.
9340870	[Alzheimer's disease and genes].	Alzheimer's disease is genetically heterogeneous. The rare familial early-onset form of the disease is caused by dominant mutations in at least four different genes. Three of these genes have now been identified and the gene for presenilin 1 (PS1) on chromosome 14 is mutated in about 75% of the families. By contrast, the common form of Alzheimer's disease has late onset and may occur as sporadic cases in the families. This form is multifactorial and the most important genetic risk factor is the E4 allele of the polymorphic apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) on chromosome 19. The E4 allele is associated with moderately or strongly increased lifetime risk of Alzheimer's disease in persons with respectively one or two copies of the gene variant. Apolipoprotein E genotyping may serve as an adjunct in the diagnostic evaluation of Alzheimer's disease, but predictive genotyping of asymptomatic persons is premature and should not be done.
10612431	Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 is secreted as a phosphoprotein by human breast cancer cells.	The growth regulatory activity of the insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) may be modulated by post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, limited proteolysis and phosphorylation. In this study, we have examined phosphorylation of IGFBP-3 in two breast cancer cell lines: the estrogen receptor negative (ER-ve) Hs578T cell line in which IGFBP-3 is normally expressed, and ER+ve T47D breast cancer cells transfected with IGFBP-3 cDNA (T47D(BP-3)) and therefore expressing IGFBP-3 constitutively. Metabolic labelling with [32P] orthophosphate revealed that both cell lines secreted phosphorylated IGFBP-3 similar in size to plasma IGFBP-3 phosphorylated in vitro with casein kinase II, and that IGFBP-3 phosphorylation was differentially modulated in the two cell lines. In Hs578T cells, retinoic acid (10-100 nM) increased IGFBP-3 phosphorylation to a maximum of 150% of control. IGF-I, but not [LR3]IGF-I, reduced the proportion of phosphorylated IGFBP-3 in Hs578T conditioned medium, consistent with increased release of non-phosphorylated, cell-associated IGFBP-3. By contrast, IGFBP-3 phosphorylation in T47D(BP-3) cells was not affected by retinoic acid or IGF-I, but appeared slightly increased by estradiol. Together these data indicate that phosphorylation of IGFBP-3 in breast cancer cells may be regulated by agents known to affect breast cancer cell proliferation.
10940495	Effect of tamoxifen treatment on the endometrial expression of human insulin-like growth factors and their receptor mRNAs.	The effect of tamoxifen (Tam) treatment on the endometrial expression of IGF-I and II/IGF-IR and IIR mRNAs was assessed by measuring the levels of expression of these mRNAs in the endometrial samples of Tam-treated postmenopausal breast cancer patients by RT-PCR assays. The levels of these mRNAs were compared with those in normal endometrium and in Type I and Type II endometrial carcinomas (EC). The promoter-specific transcript profiles of IGF-I and II were also elucidated. The levels of IGF/IGF-R mRNAs in the endometrium from Tam-treated patients were found to be comparable with the high levels of these mRNAs observed in the proliferative and early secretory phase endometrium and in the samples of Type I EC. These results indicate that Tam acts as an estrogen agonist in inducing the endometrial expression of these genes. Tam stimulated transcription from the multiple promoters of IGF-I and II, with the exception of IGF-II P2 promoter, in which case the transcription across exon 4 appeared to be inhibited. The profiles of IGF-I and II transcripts of endometrium from Tam-treated patients were similar to Type I EC but differed considerably from those of Type II EC. These results suggest that the Tam-associated ECs are likely to be similar to type I EC and will therefore have a more favorable prognosis.
11991213	Decreased erythrocyte insulin binding in hypertensive subjects with hyperinsulinemia.	BACKGROUND: This study investigates erythrocyte insulin receptor binding and affinity in subjects with hypertension and hyperinsulinemia. Insulin receptor-binding function has not been extensively studied in hypertensive subjects. METHODS: Insulin receptor density, binding affinity, and protein tyrosine kinase activity were measured in erythrocytes from 18 hypertensive and 16 normotensive subjects. Insulin sensitivity was measured by the fasting plasma insulin/glucose ratio and the homeostatic assessment model algorithm (HOMA) index. Erythrocyte insulin binding was determined by a competitive binding assay and protein tyrosine kinase activity was measured by an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay technique. RESULTS: Fasting plasma insulin/glucose ratio and the insulin resistance index (HOMA) were significantly higher in the hypertensive versus normotensive subjects. Receptor saturation of the high affinity binding sites (Bmax) was reduced in the hypertensive versus control subjects. The Kd values were lower in the erythrocytes from hypertensive than control subjects. Insulin-induced protein tyrosine kinase activity was decreased in erythrocytes from hypertensive versus control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: A reduced erythrocyte insulin receptor density and tyrosine protein kinase activity may reflect insulin receptor dysfunction in hypertensive individuals who have insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. More information is needed examining insulin receptor function in other target tissues such as fat or skeletal muscle cells before defects in the insulin receptor can be firmly proposed as a cause of the metabolic syndrome.
12560330	Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3), a potential mediator of interleukin-6-dependent insulin resistance in hepatocytes.	Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is one of several pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in insulin resistance during infection, cachexia, and obesity. We recently demonstrated that IL-6 inhibits insulin signaling in hepatocytes (Senn, J. J., Klover, P. J., Nowak, I. A., and Mooney, R. A. (2002) Diabetes 51, 3391-3399). Members of the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family associate with the insulin receptor (IR), and their ectopic expression inhibits IR signaling. Since several SOCS proteins are induced by IL-6, a working hypothesis is that IL-6-dependent insulin resistance is mediated, at least in part, by induction of SOCS protein(s) in insulin target cells. To examine the involvement of SOCS protein(s) in IL-6-dependent inhibition of insulin receptor signaling, HepG2 cells were treated with IL-6 (20 ng/ml) for periods from 1 min to 8 h. IL-6 induced SOCS-3 transcript at 30 min with a maximum effect at 1 h. SOCS-3 protein levels were also markedly elevated at 1 h. Transcript and protein levels returned to near basal levels by 2 h. SOCS-3 induction by IL-6 paralleled IL-6-dependent inhibition of IR signal transduction. Ectopically expressed SOCS-3 associated with the IR and suppressed insulin-dependent receptor autophosphorylation, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) tyrosine phosphorylation, association of IRS-1 with the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and activation of Akt. SOCS-3 was also a direct inhibitor of insulin receptor autophosphorylation in vitro. In mice exposed to IL-6 for 60-90 min, hepatic SOCS-3 expression was increased. This was associated with inhibition of hepatic insulin-dependent receptor autophosphorylation and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. These data suggest that induction of SOCS-3 in liver may be an important mechanism of IL-6-mediated insulin resistance.
8034314	Organization of the V gene segments in mouse T-cell antigen receptor alpha/delta locus.	The mouse T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha/delta locus was mapped using 17 V alpha and 4 V beta subfamily-specific probes. Four complementary methods were used: (1) an estimate of the V gene repertoire by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA with subfamily-specific probes; (2) an analysis of V gene segments deleted by TCR gene rearrangements from a panel of T-cell tumors and hybridomas; (3) an analysis of overlapping clusters of cosmid clones; and (4) an analysis of large DNA fragments separated by field-inversion gel electrophoresis. The alpha/delta locus spans about 1 Mb. The distance between the 3'-most V gene segment (V delta 1) and the delta constant gene (C delta) is no more than 150 kb. Sixty-six V gene segments have been mapped physically on cosmids. The members of individual V alpha gene segment subfamilies are dispersed throughout the locus. In contrast, the V delta gene segments V delta 1 to 5 are clustered at the 3' end of the V gene segment cluster. At least two DNA segment duplications, 45 to 80 kb in length, are present in the locus. These data provide information on the evolution of the alpha/delta locus and on organization features that might influence the expression of specific V gene segments in gamma delta cells.
8650930	[Physiology and pathophysiology of the metabolism of lipoproteins].	UNLABELLED: PHYSIOLOGY: Lipoproteins (LP) are generally classified according to their density. Triglycerides are mainly transported in chylomicrons and very low density LP (VLDL), cholesterol is mainly transported in low density LP (LDL) and high density LP (HDL). The metabolism of LP is controlled by their apolipoproteins, by specific receptors, enzymes, and transfer proteins. Triglycerides and cholesterol from the diet are transported in chylomicrons. The triglycerides are rapidly hydrolyzed by LP-lipase to yield chylomicron remnants. The released free fatty acids are used either for storage in adipose tissue or for oxidation in other tissues. Dietary cholesterol is transported in the chylomicron remnants to the liver. Cholesterol and triglyceride are also synthesized in the liver and then secreted into the blood in the form of VLDL. VLDL triglycerides are metabolized by LP-lipase to intermediate density LP (IDL), which are either taken up by the liver or further catabolized to LDL. LDL are bound and taken up by specific receptors (LDL receptors) in the liver and many other tissues. By this pathway, cholesterol is transported from the liver to peripheral tissues. LDL can be modified by oxidation and then taken up by macrophages in the arterial intima resulting in the formation of foam cells, an important step in atherogenesis. HDL play an important role in reverse cholesterol transport (transport of cholesterol back to the liver, the only site of cholesterol excretion). PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: Various mutations in the LP-lipase gene or in the apo C-II gene result in LP-lipase deficiency. Homozygous carriers of the mutated gene show defective metabolism of chylomicrons and VLDL with extreme hypertriglyceridemia, eruptive xanthomas, hepatosplenomegaly and recurrent bouts of acute pancreatitis. Many mutations in the LDL receptor gene have been described as the primary cause of familial hypercholesterolemia due to LDL receptor deficiency. LDL receptor deficiency results in the accumulation of LDL in the plasma and deposition of LDL cholesterol in tendons and skin (xanthomas) and arteries (atheromas). In homozygotes, coronary heart disease begins in childhood. Familial defective apo B-100 is caused by a mutation in codon 3500 of the apo B gene. LDL with the mutated apo B is not recognized by the LDL receptor and LDL accumulates in the blood. Mutant forms of apo E (apo E-2 and others) are not bound to the LDL(B,E)-receptor resulting in accumulation of chylomicrons and VLDL remnants (beta-VLDL) and IDL. For the manifestation of type III hyperlipemia, additional genetic, hormonal or environmental factors are involved. Cholesterol deposition in macrophages of the arterial intima and skin gives rise to atherosclerosis of coronary and peripheral arteries and xanthomas. The pathogenesis of familial combined hyperlipemia, the most frequent form of primary hyperlipemias, is multifactorial and has not been clarified in detail.
8877314	Amylin, amyloid and age-related disease.	Amylin, a 37-amino acid peptide, is cosecreted with insulin from the beta-cells of the pancreatic islets in normal response to physiological stimuli. It is the major protein of islet amyloid, which is usually present in the pancreases of people with non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes mellitus. Amylin elicits potent effects on carbohydrate metabolism in rodent tissues, causing insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and liver. A close structural relationship exists between amylin and the 2 calcitonin gene-related peptides, which are widely distributed neuropeptides and potent vasodilators. These exert biological effects similar to those of amylin on the organs primarily responsible for the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. All 3 peptides are thought to cause their biological actions by binding to similar cell surface receptors. This article reviews the field of amylin and its role in the physiological regulation of carbohydrate metabolism, and in disease mechanisms associated with insulin resistance in diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance and essential hypertension. Potential therapeutic applications are also discussed.
9105560	Familial ligand-defective apolipoprotein B-100: detection, biochemical features and haplotype analysis of the R3531C mutation in the UK.	Familial ligand-defective apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 (FDB) is an autosomal codominant disorder which may give rise to hypercholesterolaemia. It is caused by the substitution of glutamine for arginine at codon 3500 of the apo B gene (apo B R3500Q), resulting in decreased binding of low density lipoprotein (LDL) to the LDL receptor. In order to search for other mutations in this region of the apo B gene, we have screened genomic DNA, obtained from 412 hypercholesterolaemic individuals, using heteroduplex analysis. Additional heteroduplex bands were observed following analysis of DNA from 11 individuals, nine of whom were heterozygous for apo B R3500Q. The two remaining individuals, both of Celtic origin, were shown by DNA sequencing to be heterozygous for a C-->T transition at nucleotide 10800 of the apo B gene, resulting in the substitution of cysteine for arginine at codon 3531 (apo B R3531C). Both had a strong family history of atherosclerosis and family studies revealed a further four individuals heterozygous for the mutation, three of whom were hypercholesterolaemic. Individuals heterozygous for apo B R3531C and R3500Q had mean +/- S.E.M. cholesterol concentrations of 7.82 +/- 0.68 and 8.53 +/- 0.31 mmol/l, respectively. These values were significantly higher than the value of 5.51 +/- 0.23 mmol/l observed in their unaffected relatives. These findings suggest that apo B R3531C is both less common in the UK and gives rise to a less severe form of hypercholesterolaemia than the classical 3500 mutation. In one of the families, the R3531C mutation occurred on a haplotype, compatible with that previously assigned to the mutation in a North American family also of Celtic origin. This is consistent with the mutation having been inherited from a common distant ancestor in individuals of Celtic origin.
10995803	Role of the insulin-like growth factor family in cancer development and progression.	The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are mitogens that play a pivotal role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The effects of IGFs are mediated through the IGF-I receptor, which is also involved in cell transformation induced by tumor virus proteins and oncogene products. Six IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) can inhibit or enhance the actions of IGFs. These opposing effects are determined by the structures of the binding proteins. The effects of IGFBPs on IGFs are regulated in part by IGFBP proteases. Laboratory studies have shown that IGFs exert strong mitogenic and antiapoptotic actions on various cancer cells. IGFs also act synergistically with other mitogenic growth factors and steroids and antagonize the effect of antiproliferative molecules on cancer growth. The role of IGFs in cancer is supported by epidemiologic studies, which have found that high levels of circulating IGF-I and low levels of IGFBP-3 are associated with increased risk of several common cancers, including those of the prostate, breast, colorectum, and lung. Evidence further suggests that certain lifestyles, such as one involving a high-energy diet, may increase IGF-I levels, a finding that is supported by animal experiments indicating that IGFs may abolish the inhibitory effect of energy restriction on cancer growth. Further investigation of the role of IGFs in linking high energy intake, increased cell proliferation, suppression of apoptosis, and increased cancer risk may provide new insights into the etiology of cancer and lead to new strategies for cancer prevention.
7515389	Expression of the genes encoding the insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and II), the IGF and insulin receptors, and IGF-binding proteins-1-6 and the localization of their gene products in normal and polycystic ovary syndrome ovaries.	To discern the potential role of the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), we examined the expression of the genes encoding the IGFs, IGF receptors (IGFr), insulin receptor (Ir), and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs-1-6) as well as the localization of the gene products in specific cellular compartments of normal and PCOS human ovaries. Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was localized by in situ hybridization with specific 35S-labeled human antisense RNA probes, and protein was detected by immunohistochemistry using specific antisera. Thecal cells, but not granulosa cells (GC), of small antral follicles (3-6 mm) from PCOS ovaries expressed both IGF-I and IGF-II transcripts. Abundant IGF-Ir mRNA was found only in GC, IGF-IIr mRNA was found in both granulosa and thecal cells, and Ir mRNA was detected in all cell types, including granulosa, thecal, and stromal cells. Localization of the gene products revealed no IGF-I immunoreactivity; however, immunostaining for each of the other gene products was colocalized with its corresponding mRNA. The cellular distribution of mRNA and protein in PCOS follicles was indistinguishable from that observed in small antral follicles from normal ovaries. In dominant follicles, however, IGF-I mRNA was no longer detectable, but abundant IGF-II mRNA was expressed exclusively in GC. Although IGF-Ir mRNA was expressed in GC, IGF-IIr mRNA was found in both granulosa and thecal cells. In follicles taken from PCOS ovaries, no IGFBP-1 mRNA was detected, IGFBP-2 mRNA was abundant in both granulosa and thecal cells, moderate IGFBP-3 mRNA was found only in thecal cells, IGFBP-4 and -5 mRNAs were present in all cellular compartments, and IGFBP-6 mRNA was not detected. Localization of the gene products by immunostaining revealed that each protein colocalized with its corresponding mRNA. The cellular distribution of IGFBP mRNA and protein in PCOS follicles was also indistinguishable from that in small antral follicles of normal ovaries, but remarkable differences were found in dominant follicles, where abundant IGFBP-1 mRNA was seen exclusively in GC, IGFBP-2 mRNA in thecal cells, and IGFBP-3 mRNA in both granulosa and thecal cells. Moderate expression of the IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5 genes was seen in all cell types, including stromal cells, but no IGFBP-6 mRNA was detected. Again, each of the gene products colocalized with its corresponding mRNA. We conclude the following.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
7806523	Chimeric receptors indicate that phenylalanine 39 is a major contributor to insulin specificity of the insulin receptor.	The exact nature of how the insulin molecule interacts with the insulin receptor is obscure although chimeric receptors have shown that the ligand specificity of the insulin receptor and the IGF-I receptor (i.e. the sequences that discriminate between insulin and insulin-like growth factor I) reside in different regions of a common binding site and that the N-terminal 68 amino acids of the insulin receptor are involved in conferring specificity for insulin on this receptor (Kjeldsen, T., Andersen, A. S., Wiberg, F. C., Rasmussen, J. S., Schäffer, L., Balschmidt, P., Møller, K. B., and Møller, N. P. H. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 88, 4404-4408). Using chimeric insulin/IGF-I receptors to elucidate how the insulin receptor interacts with the insulin molecule we identified phenylalanine 39 of the insulin receptor as a major contributor in determining the receptor specificity for insulin, increasing insulin affinity 15-fold when replacing the corresponding amino acid in the insulin-like growth factor I receptor. Furthermore, replacement of the insulin receptor amino acid phenylalanine 39 with the corresponding IGF-I receptor amino acid, serine 35, decreased insulin affinity 8-fold.
10889625	Post-basic cancer nursing education in Belgium: an innovative collaboration between a nursing school, a comprehensive cancer centre and the Oncology Nursing Society.	Since 1989, the Nursing School attached to the Free University, Brussels, has organized post-basic courses in cancer nursing, with the collaboration of the Belgian Oncology Nursing Society (French speaking) (SIO) and a comprehensive cancer centre, the Jules Bordet Institute. The 1-day-a-week course evolves over 30 weeks and is open to registered nurses. Its structure and its content respect the recommendations of the Core Curriculum for a Post-Basic Course in Cancer Nursing (EONS, 1989). However, there are some differences related to the entry requirements, the clinical experience, and the evaluation of both the course and the students' performance. So far, 72 nurses from different cancer units from the southern part of Belgium have obtained the certificate at the end of this course. In parallel with the 1-day-a-week course, seven modular courses were set up during the first semester of 1992, with the financial support of the 'Europe against Cancer' Programme. Each module tackles a specific theme: Basic Principles in Oncology Nursing; Training the Trainers; Prevention and Early Screening; Rehabilitation--Palliative Care--Psycho-oncology (one short and one long module); Radiotherapy; and Chemotherapy.
12126534	[Regulation of human progesterone receptor isoforms A and B in uterine endometrial carcinoma by estrogen and insulin-like growth factor-1].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the regulation of human progesterone receptor isoforms A and B in uterine endometrial carcinoma by estrogen and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) so as to provide theoretical basis for clinical hormone treatment of uterine endothelium cancer. METHODS: The uterine endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line HEC-IB and the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 were cultured in vitro. The HEC-IB cells were stimulated by 10 nmol/L estrogen and 20 ng/ml IGF-I respectively for 72 h. The MCF-7 cells were stimulated by 10 nmol/L estrogen for 72 h. Western blotting was used to examine the protein levels of the two isoforms of receptors of progesterone. RNA was extracted from the cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the mRNA levels of the isoform B. RESULTS: (1) Western blotting showed that the photodensity values of hPRA and hPRB did not change significantly after the HEC-IB cells were stimulated by estrogen for 72 hours (P = 0.716, and 0.391 respectively), however, the hPRA and hPRB were significantly down-regulated after IGF-I had been given for 72h (P = 0.008 and 0.002 respectively). After MCF-7 cell was given estrogen for 72 h hPR-A tended to be up- regulated but this change had no significant difference (P = 0.074) however, hPRB was significantly up- regulated (P = 0.044). (2) RT-PCR showed that hPRB mRNA was not expressed in HEC-IB cells originally, and became positive after stimulation by estrogen and IGF-1 for 72 hours respectively, however, the expression level being higher in the HEC-IB cells stimulated by estrogen than in those stimulated by IGF-1. hPRB was not expressed in MCF-7 cells originally too, and became positive after simulation by estrogen and IGF-1 for 72 hours respectively, however, the expression level being higher in the MCF-7 cells stimulated by estrogen than in those stimulated by IGF-1. CONCLUSION: (1) Estrogen and IGF-I regulate hPR isoforms and have cell specialty. (2) Estrogen and IGF-I up- regulate hPRB mRNA at gene level or transcription level, but there are some inhibitory factors which make the protein production become less after transcription.
7504303	Association and phosphorylation-dependent dissociation of proteins in the insulin receptor complex.	Receptor tyrosine kinases have been found to interact with a variety of specific signaling molecules. To detect molecules that interact with the insulin receptor, we have produced a modified insulin receptor with an additional epitope allowing rapid purification under mild conditions of the insulin receptor complex. By this method we have found multiple proteins (including the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase and the ras GTPase-activating protein) that specifically associate with the activated (phosphorylated) insulin receptor (insulin receptor complex proteins) but are released from the complex after they are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. We have also shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 by the activated insulin receptor blocks binding to the activated receptor. These results suggest that association of proteins with the insulin receptor complex is controlled by phosphorylation of the receptor, while dissociation of insulin receptor complex proteins is controlled in turn by phosphorylation of the proteins in the insulin receptor complex. This process results in the dispersion of phosphorylated insulin receptor complex proteins into the cell.
8251646	Dietary habits and mammographic patterns in patients with breast cancer.	Between 1983 and 1986, dietary history interviews were conducted with 238 women aged 50-65 years who had surgery for stage I-II breast cancer. Diagnostic mammograms were coded in line with Wolfe's criteria in N1, P1, P2, and Dy patterns. Women with Dy pattern reported significantly higher intake of total fat, monounsaturated fatty acids (FA), polyunsaturated FA, n-3 FA, n-6 FA in per cent of energy (E%), and alpha-tocopherol in mg/10 MJ. Fat intake was lowest in women with N1 pattern and highest in those having Dy pattern. Patients having ER-rich cancers and Dy pattern reported significantly higher intake of total fat, monounsaturated FA, polyunsaturated FA, n-6 FA (E%), and alpha-tocopherol (mg/10 MJ), as well as significantly lower intake of carbohydrate (E%) and calcium (g/10 MJ). In the stepwise multivariate analysis, the multivariate-odds ratio (OR) for having P2 + Dy patterns was 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.12) for each increment in E% of total fat. In women with ER-rich tumors this OR was 1.09 (95% CI, 1.02-1.16). The highest self-reported body mass index (BMI) was observed in women with N1 + P1 patterns. OR for having P2 + Dy patterns was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.83-0.98) for each increment in 1 kg/m2 of BMI. The results suggest that dietary habits affect the mammographic parenchymal pattern in women with breast cancer and that a high fat intake is associated with a higher proportion of mammograms with Dy pattern in such patients.
8606887	Prenatal analysis of the insulin receptor gene in a family with leprechaunism.	Leprechaunism is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by intrauterine and postnatal growth restriction, loss of glucose homeostasis, and severe insulin resistance. This disease is caused by a failure of function of the insulin receptor and is lethal early in life. Here we report the prenatal diagnosis of leprechaunism in one consanguineous family, Atl-1, in which two homozygous-affected siblings died with leprechaunism. The mutation in their insulin receptor impaired insulin binding and altered receptor signalling. Prenatal diagnosis could not be accomplished using insulin binding to cultured amniocytes, but was possible mutational analysis of the insulin receptor gene in DNA from amniotic cells.
10699916	Stable amino-acid sequence of the mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth-factor-II receptor in ovarian carcinomas with loss of heterozygosity and in breast-cancer cell lines.	The mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (Man-6-P/IGFII receptor) is involved in lysosomal enzyme sorting, IGFII degradation and pro-TGFbeta activation. Genetic alterations in hepatocarcinomas and a few breast cancers suggest that this receptor behaves as a tumor suppressor. Moreover, hypersecretion and Man-6-P-independent targeting of cathepsins in breast and ovarian carcinomas also suggest alterations in this receptor. We studied the Man-6-P/IGFII receptor gene in 8 ovarian carcinomas, and 4 breast- and ovarian-cancer cell lines. The results confirmed a frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the 6q27-qter region in 5 out of 8 ovarian carcinomas. We used 23 overlapping RT-PCR fragments to sequence the whole coding region of the Man-6-P/IGFII receptor. The 2491 amino-acid sequence of this receptor was perfectly conserved in 9 out of 10 of our samples, including MCF7 and MDA-MB231 cells and 5 ovarian carcinomas with LOH. This allowed us to rectify the 2 previously published sequences which differed in several bases, and to propose a consensus amino-acid sequence. The only amino-acid change (Thr --> Ala) was in BG1 ovarian-cancer cells, and was due to an A-to-G substitution on one allele at nucleotide 2561. We found no bi-allelic alterations in the 9 ovarian carcinomas, but 3 silent nucleotide substitutions leading to a lower cordon usage in 2 ovarian carcinomas with LOH. No mutation of the Man-6-P/IGFII receptor coding sequence was found in breast-cancer cell lines to explain the cathepsin-D hypersecretion and Man-6-P-independent trafficking described. We propose that, in breast and ovarian cancers, the frequent loss of one allele, associated with over-expression of some of its ligands, might be sufficient to saturate the receptor protein, displace the ligands to other sites, and consequently facilitate tumor progression.
11280720	The 104-123 amino acid sequence of the beta-domain of von Hippel-Lindau gene product is sufficient to inhibit renal tumor growth and invasion.	The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is mutated in patients with VHL disease and in the majority of patients with sporadic renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). RCCs are dependent on insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor-mediated signaling for tumor growth and invasion in vivo. Reintroduction of the VHL gene product (pVHL) can inhibit on insulin-like growth factor-I receptor-mediated signaling in RCC cells in vitro through interaction with protein kinase C delta and is mediated by a specific amino acid sequence (104-123) in the beta-domain of the pVHL. In the present study, the amino acid sequence (104-123) of the pVHL was conjugated to the protein transduction domain of HIV-TAT protein (TATFLAGVHL-peptide) to facilitate entry into cells, and we demonstrate that this amino acid region of VHL is sufficient to block proliferation and invasion of 786-O renal cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, daily i.p. injections with the TATFLAGVHL peptide retarded and, in some cases, caused partial regression of renal tumors that were implanted in the dorsal flank of nude mice. Treatment with this peptide also inhibits the invasiveness of renal tumors. A 56% decrease in the proliferative index in tumors treated with the TATFLAGVHL-peptide versus control-peptide-treated mice was observed. Taken together, these results show the novel importance of a 20-amino acid sequence of the beta-domain of the VHL gene product capable of inhibiting tumor growth and invasion. These results lay the foundation for a unique approach toward treating RCCs using this small-molecular-weight peptide fused to the TAT-sequence, which may, in the future, be used alone or in conjunction with other therapies.
12790794	Interactions between estrogen and insulin-like growth factor signaling pathways in human breast tumor cells.	Estrogens and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) act as mitogens promoting cell proliferation in normal breast tissue as well as in breast carcinomas. Both hormones have been shown to play a role in the development of breast cancer and were found to activate multiple signaling pathways leading to proliferation of human breast cancer cell lines in vitro. Originally, it was considered that these agents manifest their mitogenic actions through separate pathways, but a growing body of evidence suggests that the IGF- and estrogen-mediated signaling pathways are intertwined. 17beta-Estradiol (E2) has been shown to enhance IGF signaling at multiple levels. E2 treatment of breast cancer cells alters expression of nearly all of the IGF family members including IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF-binding proteins, IGF type I receptor (IGF-RI), and insulin receptor substrate 1. The ligand-bound estrogen receptor has been reported to bind to and to activate the IGF-RI directly. Vice versa, IGF signaling has been reported to enhance estrogen receptor activation in human breast cancer cells by inducing phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor. Finally, several groups have described synergistic effects of the combination of E2 and IGF-I on S phase entry in breast tumor cell lines. Here, we review recent, often contradictory, reports describing the effects of E2 and IGFs on the proliferation of breast tumor cells, with special emphasis on the synergistic effects of the two hormones.
7585875	Human genome--chromosome no. 19.	Chromosome 19 is short but has higher relative density of genes than other chromosomes. Increasing number of the genes coding for proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of various human diseases have been mapped on chromosome 19. Mutations of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) result in one of the most frequent mendelian inherited disorder-familial hypercholesterolemia. Mutations of insulin receptor (INSR) are causative for rare syndromes of insulin resistance and some of non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) mutations are causative for rare primary familial and congenital polycythemias (PFCP). Defects of one of the largest gene in the human genome RYR 1 (ryanodine receptor gene) (> 240 kb in size) accounts for majority of malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (CCD). All these disorders represent group of receptor diseases. The amplification of GCT trinucleotide repeats in myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene is causative for myotonic dystrophy (DM) and represents a new class of human gene mutations: trinucleotide repeat mutations. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) locus plays a role in pathogenesis of the late onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Translocation of EA2 gene which encodes two helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription proteins and its fusion with PBXI or hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) leads to the leukemogenesis in subgroup of ALL. Interestingly adeno-associated virus (AAV), currently widely used as vector for gene therapy has unique capability of specific integration into human chromosome 19q.
7674023	Acromegaly, diabetes insipidus, and visual loss caused by metastatic growth hormone-releasing hormone-producing malignant pancreatic endocrine tumor in the pituitary gland. Case report.	The case of a 52-year-old woman with acromegaly, diabetes insipidus, and visual impairment caused by a metastatic growth hormone-releasing hormone (GRH)-produced pancreatic tumor is reported. Serum growth hormone (GH) and somatomedin C levels were elevated to 14 ng/ml (normal < 5 ng/ml), and 3.20 U/ml (normal < 1.88 U/ml), respectively. Paradoxical increases were observed in GH levels after glucose tolerance and thyrotropin-releasing hormone-stimulation tests. Biopsy of a pituitary tumor observed on computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance studies revealed a metastatic cancer. When circulating GRH levels were measured, a marked increase in plasma GRH (1145 pg/ml; normal < 4-1 pg/ml) was observed. The patient died of cachexia due to metastases. Postmortem examination revealed that a primary tumor, a malignant endocrine lesion, was present in the pancreas, with metastatic tumors in the pituitary, lung, liver, and adrenal glands. Synthesis and production of GRH by the tumor was demonstrated by Northern blotting and immunohistochemical analysis. The pituitary gland showed hyperplastic, but not adenomatous changes. The authors stress the importance of both exploration for an ectopic source of GRH and the search for a GH-producing pituitary adenoma when unusual signs and symptoms are seen in patients with acromegaly.
7734771	[Oncogenic activation of p21(ras) and pp60(c-src) in human colonic Caco-2 cells decreases insulin receptor function and expression through protein kinase C-dependent and independent pathways].	In view of the potent mitogenic effect exerted by insulin in human colonic cells, we used Caco-2 cells transfected with an activated (Val12) human Ha-ras gene or the polyoma middle T (PyMT) oncogene, a constitutive activator of pp60c-src tyrosine kinase activity, to investigate the effect of oncogenic p21ras and PyMT/pp60c-src on insulin mitogenic signaling. As compared to vector control Caco-2 cells, both oncogene-transfected cells exhibited: 1) a lost of response to insulin's stimulatory effect on mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity and cell proliferation, both of which were constitutively increased; 2) a decrease in insulin receptor (IR) affinity and insulin-stimulated exogenous tyrosine kinase activity, which resulted, at least in part, from increased protein kinase C (PKC) activity (4), since both IR alterations were partially corrected by PKC down-regulation; and 3) a decrease in both insulin receptor mRNA level and insulin receptor number, which was independent of PKC since it persisted after PKC down-regulation. In conclusion, oncogenic p21ras and PyMT/pp60c-src abolished insulin mitogenic signaling in Caco-2 cells through mechanisms involving (i) constitutive activation of MAP kinase, and (ii) marked decreases in both insulin receptor function and expression which were mediated by PKC-dependent and PKC-independent pathways respectively. This is the first evidence that, when oncogenically activated, p21ras and pp60c-src not only exert a negative control on insulin receptor function but also repress insulin receptor gene expression in human colonic cells.
8163057	Lack of association of the insulin gene region with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus in Japanese subjects.	Although the insulin gene region is implicated in susceptibility to Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus in Caucasians, significance of this region to Type 1 diabetes in Japanese remains unclear because the class 1 alleles (shorter insertion) of the variable number of tandem repeat in the 5' region of the insulin gene are predominant in both diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. The 5' insulin gene polymorphism was analysed in 75 Japanese patients and 69 control subjects with a precise method using PvuII and a polymorphism specific probe, which enabled us to divide class 1 alleles into four subclasses. Allelic frequencies were not significantly different between Type 1 diabetic patients and control subjects. The polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of the insulin gene (1127/PstI) was also analysed and found to be tightly linked to the 5' insulin gene polymorphism, and thus was not associated with diabetes. Interaction between HLA-DR and the insulin gene region, which was reported in the French study, was not observed in Japanese. These results suggest that the insulin gene region is not a valuable genetic risk factor for Type 1 diabetes in Japanese.
11149601	Inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase selectively inhibits cell proliferation in human breast cancer cells displaying enhanced insulin-like growth factor I-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase activation.	Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase mediates cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and cell survival by regulating signaling pathways activated by receptor protein tyrosine kinases (RPTKs), including the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-IR). We analyzed the upstream signaling components of the MAP kinase pathway, including RPTKs, in human breast cancer cell lines and found that some of those components were overexpressed. Importantly, signaling molecules such as IGF-IR, insulin receptor, and insulin receptor substrate 1, leading to the MAP kinase pathway, were found to be concomitantly overexpressed within certain tumor lines, i.e., MCF-7 and T-47D. When compared with the nonmalignant and other breast tumor lines examined, MCF-7 and T-47D cells displayed a more rapid, robust, and sustained MAP kinase activation in response to insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) stimulation. By contrast, IGF-I treatment led to a sustained down-regulation of MAP kinase in those lines overexpressing ErbB2-related RPTKs. Interestingly, blocking the MAP kinase pathway with PD098059 had the greatest antiproliferative effect on MCF-7 and T-47D among the normal and tumor lines tested. Furthermore, addition of an IGF-IR blocking antibody to growth medium attenuated the ability of PD098059 to suppress the growth of MCF-7 and T-47D cells. Thus, our study suggests that concomitant overexpression of multiple signaling components of the IGF-IR pathway leads to the amplification of IGF-I-mediated MAP kinase signaling and resultant sensitization to PD098059. The enhanced sensitivity to PD098059 implies an increased requirement for the MAP kinase pathway in those breast cancer cells, making this pathway a potential target in the treatment of selected breast malignancies.
11480076	[Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet growth factor receptor (PGFR) and insulin growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) on lung cancer cell].	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the expression of growth factor receptors (GFRs) on lung cancer cells and the relation between the expression of GFRs and metastasis of lung cancer. METHOD: The expression of EGFR, PDGFR and IGF-1R was detected with immunohistochemical method using monoclonal antibodies. RESULT: The expression of EGFR, PDGFR and IGF-1R showed higher positive rates in lung cancer cells than those in normal lung tissues, and the expression was increased as the disease was advanced. CONCLUSION: The increased expression of EGFR, PDGFR and IGF-1R is related with the metastasis of lung cancer.
11641236	Defects of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) system in human metabolic disorders.	Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) molecules are key mediators in insulin signaling and play a central role in maintaining basic cellular functions such as growth, survival, and metabolism. They act as docking proteins between the insulin receptor and a complex network of intracellular signaling molecules containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. Four members (IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-3, IRS-4) of this family have been identified that differ as to tissue distribution, subcellular localization, developmental expression, binding to the insulin receptor, and interaction with SH2 domain-containing proteins. Results from targeted disruption of the IRS genes in mice have provided important clues to the functional differences among these related molecules, suggesting they play different and specific roles in vivo. The available data are consistent with the notion that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are not functionally interchangeable in tissues that are responsible for glucose production (liver), glucose uptake (skeletal muscle and adipose tissue), and insulin production (pancreatic beta cells). In fact, IRS-1 appears to have its major role in skeletal muscle whereas IRS-2 appears to regulate hepatic insulin action as well as pancreatic beta cell development and survival. By contrast, IRS-3 and IRS-4 genes appear to play a redundant role in the IRS signaling system. Defects in muscle IRS-1 expression and function have been reported in insulin-resistant states such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Several polymorphisms in the IRS genes have been identified, but only the Gly-->Arg972 substitution of IRS-1, interacting with environmental factors, seems to have a pathogenic role in the development of type 2 diabetes. In contrast, polymorphisms of the other IRS genes do not appear to contribute to type 2 diabetes.
12228220	SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 block insulin signaling by ubiquitin-mediated degradation of IRS1 and IRS2.	Inflammation associates with peripheral insulin resistance, which dysregulates nutrient homeostasis and leads to diabetes. Inflammation induces the expression of SOCS proteins. We show that SOCS1 or SOCS3 targeted IRS1 and IRS2, two critical signaling molecules for insulin action, for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. SOCS1 or SOCS3 bound both recombinant and endogenous IRS1 and IRS2 and promoted their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation in multiple cell types. Mutations in the conserved SOCS box of SOCS1 abrogated its interaction with the elongin BC ubiquitin-ligase complex without affecting its binding to IRS1 or IRS2. The SOCS1 mutants also failed to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of either IRS1 or IRS2. Adenoviral-mediated expression of SOCS1 in mouse liver dramatically reduced hepatic IRS1 and IRS2 protein levels and caused glucose intolerance; by contrast, expression of the SOCS1 mutants had no effect. Thus, SOCS-mediated degradation of IRS proteins, presumably via the elongin BC ubiquitin-ligase, might be a general mechanism of inflammation-induced insulin resistance, providing a target for therapy.
7504533	Enzymatic and immunohistochemical evaluation of tyrosine phosphorylation in breast cancer specimens.	Using a synthetic peptide substrate, tyrosine protein kinase (TPK) activity was measured in 21 tumors from patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer and in five normal breast tissues from patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty. In 20 of 21 cancer specimens, tumor was available to assess phosphotyrosine (PT) immunohistochemically. Breast cancer specimens possessed significantly more TPK activity than normal breast tissues (Cancer = 43.9 +/- 3.1 pm/mg protein/min, [Mean +/- S.E.M.]; Normal = 3.4 +/- 0.9, p < 0.001). TPK activity was higher in the clinically more aggressive infiltrating ductal cancers compared to the less aggressive intraductal cancers (Infiltrating = 55.9 +/- 5.8; Intraductal = 17.2 +/- 3.4, p < 0.01). TPK activity in tumors with both infiltrating and intraductal histology was intermediate (34.0 +/- 7.2). Significant correlation existed between membrane TPK enzymatic activity and PT expression by immunohistochemistry. There was no relationship between estrogen or progesterone receptor status and TPK activity or PT; however, TPK activity from node negative breast cancer tissue was significantly less than from node positive specimens (p < 0.01). We conclude that breast cancer specimens possess elevated amounts of TPK which correlate with PT expression, and that increased tyrosine phosphorylation appears to correlate with the biologic aggressiveness of the malignant tumor.
8911609	Unusual xanthomas in a young patient with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and type III hyperlipoproteinemia.	We report on a 20-year-old man with the combination of two independent familial lipoprotein disorders: heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP). Familial hypercholesterolemia was diagnosed by elevated total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and family history. By denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, DNA sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, a G --> A splice donor mutation in intron 3 of the proband's low density lipoprotein receptor gene was identified as the underlying molecular defect. This mutation was described previously as a receptor-negative founder mutation in Norway (FH-Elverum) and subsequently in 6 unrelated heterozygous English patients, creating a severe phenotype of familial hypercholesterolemia. Type III HLP was confirmed by homozygosity for apolipoprotein (apo) E2 and an elevated ratio of very low density lipoprotein cholesterol to serum triglycerides (0.40; normal ratio about 0.20). The patient has unusual flat xanthomas in the interdigital webs of the hands which are normally not found in either disease. These dermatological findings might therefore be indicative of the rare combination of both disorders of lipoprotein metabolism in one individual.
9312143	14-3-3 protein binds to insulin receptor substrate-1, one of the binding sites of which is in the phosphotyrosine binding domain.	Insulin binding to its receptor induces the phosphorylation of cytosolic substrates, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2, which associate with several Src homology-2 domain-containing proteins. To identify unique IRS-1-binding proteins, we screened a human heart cDNA library with 32P-labeled recombinant IRS-1 and obtained two isoforms (epsilon and zeta) of the 14-3-3 protein family. 14-3-3 protein has been shown to associate with IRS-1 in L6 myotubes, HepG2 hepatoma cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and bovine brain tissue. IRS-2, a protein structurally similar to IRS-1, was also shown to form a complex with 14-3-3 protein using a baculovirus expression system. The amount of 14-3-3 protein associated with IRS-1 was not affected by insulin stimulation but was increased significantly by treatment with okadaic acid, a potent serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor. Peptide inhibition experiments using phosphoserine-containing peptides of IRS-1 revealed that IRS-1 contains three putative binding sites for 14-3-3 protein (Ser-270, Ser-374, and Ser-641). Among these three, the motif around Ser-270 is located in the phosphotyrosine binding domain of IRS-1, which is responsible for the interaction with the insulin receptor. Indeed, a truncated mutant of IRS-1 consisting of only the phosphotyrosine binding domain retained the capacity to bind to 14-3-3 protein in vivo. Finally, the effect of 14-3-3 protein binding on the insulin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was investigated. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that IRS-1 coimmunoprecipitated with anti-14-3-3 antibody to be weakly phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, on tyrosine as well as serine residues, compared with IRS-1 immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 antibody. Thus, the association with 14-3-3 protein may play a role in the regulation of insulin sensitivity by interrupting the association between the insulin receptor and IRS-1.
7918304	Apolipoprotein E polymorphism and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Sex-specific effects.	The impact of apolipoprotein (apo) E polymorphism on interindividual variation in plasma lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein levels was studied in a sample of familial hypercholesterolemic (FH) patients (147 women, 116 men) with the same mutation, a > 10-kilobase deletion of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene. Each trait was adjusted for concomitants (age, age squared, height, weight, weight squared) for each sex separately before the apoE genotypic effects were estimated. The relative contribution of concomitants to sample variability was found to be very different in women and in men. Allelic variation in the apoE gene was shown to explain a statistically significant portion of the variability in adjusted lipid traits. Moreover, the contribution of apoE polymorphism was different between sexes. In women, there was significant variability (P < .01) among apoE genotypes for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and total and LDL apoB. In men, significant variability (P < .01) was observed among apoE genotypes in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Women with the epsilon 3/2 genotype had significantly lower means for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and LDL apoB than women with the epsilon 3/3 genotype (P < .05). In men, the mean VLDL cholesterol was significantly higher for the epsilon 2/2 genotype and was significantly lower for the epsilon 4/2 genotype than the mean for the epsilon 3/3 genotype (P < .05). Overall, the greatest influence was associated with the epsilon 2 allele, and the LDL cholesterol-lowering effect of this allele was present only in FH women. No statistically significant apoE effect was shown on lipoprotein(a) levels in either sex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
8132782	Cellular distribution of insulin-degrading enzyme gene expression. Comparison with insulin and insulin-like growth factor receptors.	Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) hydrolyzes both insulin and IGFs and has been proposed to play a role in signal termination after binding of these peptides to their receptors. In situ hybridization was used to investigate the cellular distribution of IDE mRNA and to compare it with insulin receptor (IR) and IGF-I receptor (IGFR) gene expression in serial thin sections from a variety of tissues in embryonic and adult rats. IDE mRNA is highly abundant in kidney and liver, tissues known to play a role in insulin degradation. IDE and IR mRNAs are highly coexpressed in brown fat and liver. The highest level IDE gene expression, on a per cell basis, is found in germinal epithelium. IDE and IGFR mRNAs are colocalized in oocytes, while IDE is colocalized with the IGF-II receptor in spermatocytes, suggesting that IDE may be involved with degradation of IGF-II in the testis. In summary, IDE expression demonstrates significant anatomical correlation with insulin/IGF receptors. These data are compatible with a role for IDE in degrading insulin and IGFs after they bind to and are internalized with their respective receptors and may also suggest a novel role for IDE in germ cells.
8995282	Functional association between the insulin receptor and the transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase LAR in intact cells.	The receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase LAR (for leukocyte common antigen-related) has been implicated as a physiological regulator of the insulin receptor. To demonstrate a functional interaction between LAR and the insulin receptor, we incubated CHO cells overexpressing the human insulin receptor with an antibody to the extracellular domain of LAR and found a 47% decrease in insulin receptor autophosphorylation and kinase activity. A physical association between LAR and the insulin receptor was then shown by immunoprecipitation of LAR from cell lysates and immunoblotting with antibody to the insulin receptor, or vice versa. Up to 11.8% of the LAR protein in the lysates of CHO cells overexpressing both the insulin receptor and LAR co-immunoprecipitated with the insulin receptor. The LAR/insulin receptor association was related to the level of LAR or insulin receptor overexpression and was increased 6.5-fold by chemical cross-linking and 3.9-fold by treatment with insulin, suggesting that receptor activation influences the affinity of LAR for the insulin receptor. In insulin-stimulated rat liver, LAR was temporally enriched in endosomes with the insulin receptor, and incubation of endosomes with neutralizing LAR antibodies decreased insulin receptor dephosphorylation in situ by 28% (p = 0.01 versus control). These data provide more direct evidence of a role for LAR in the physiological regulation of insulin action at the receptor level.
11358798	Coordinately up-regulated genes in ovarian cancer.	A better understanding of the molecular circuitry in normal ovarian tissues and in ovarian cancer will likely provide new targets for diagnosis and therapy. Recently, much has been learned about the genes expressed in ovarian cancer through studies with cDNA arrays and serial analysis of gene expression. However, these methods do not allow highly quantitative analysis of gene expression on a large number of specimens. Here, we have used quantitative real-time RT-PCR in a panel of 39 microdissected ovarian carcinomas of various subtypes to systematically analyze the expression of 13 genes, many of which were previously identified as up-regulated in a subset of ovarian cancers by serial analyses of gene expression. The genes analyzed are glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), apolipoprotein J/clusterin, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2, epithelial cell adhesion molecule/GA733-2, Kop protease inhibitor, matrix gla protein, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3, folate receptor 1, S100A2, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, apolipoprotein E, and ceruloplasmin. All of the genes were found overexpressed, some at extremely high levels, in the vast majority of ovarian carcinomas irrespective of the subtype. Interestingly, GPX3 was found at much higher levels in tumors with clear cell histology and may represent a biomarker for this subtype. Some of the genes studied here may thus represent targets for early detection ovarian cancer. The gene expression patterns were not associated with age at diagnosis, stage, or K-ras mutation status in ovarian cancer. We find that several genes are coordinately regulated in ovarian cancer, likely representing the fact that many genes are activated as part of common signaling pathways or that extensive cross-talk exists between several pathways in ovarian cancer. A statistical analysis shows that genes commonly up-regulated in ovarian cancer may result from the aberrant activation of a limited number of pathways, providing promising targets for novel therapeutic strategies.
8625887	Paradoxical effects of overexpression of the type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor on the responsiveness of human breast cancer cells to IGFs and estradiol.	Estrogens increase the proliferative response of estrogen-responsive breast cancer cells to insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). The mechanisms involved are unclear, but the observation that estradiol increases type I IGF receptor levels in MCF-7 breast cancer cells has suggested that the increased response may be due to increased expression of type I IGF receptor. The purpose of this study was to investigate this hypothesis by using a retroviral expression vector to constitutively over-express the type I IGF receptor in estrogen-responsive breast cancer cells. We isolated clones of infected MCF-7 cells that expressed up to 4.5-fold more receptor than the estradiol-induced level in cells infected with a control vector. Hybridization of a type I IGF receptor complementary DNA probe to RNA extracted from these clones showed that most of the receptor RNA was transcribed from the retroviral provirus. Estrogen receptor continued to be expressed in clones overexpressing type I IGF receptor, and overexpression had little effect on the induction of an estrogen-regulated gene by estradiol and the proliferative response to IGFs alone or estradiol alone. Overexpression did, however, alter the proliferative response to IGFs in the presence of estradiol. The three clones analyzed showed an increased sensitivity to low IGF-I concentrations and a paradoxical attenuation of the synergistic effect between estradiol and IGF-I at high IGF-I concentrations. Collectively, these experiments show that the level of expression of the type I IGF receptor is an important determinant in the responsiveness of breast cancer cells to estrogen, but the observation that the response of cells to estradiol alone is not affected by constitutive overexpression of the type I IGF receptor suggests that estrogens stimulate the proliferation of breast cancer cells by regulating the expression of genes in addition to the type I IGF receptor.
10816436	Signalling pathways of insulin-like growth factor-I that are augmented by cAMP in FRTL-5 cells.	We have reported that pretreatment of rat FRTL-5 thyroid cells with thyrotropin (TSH) markedly potentiates the mitogenic response to insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). The present study was undertaken to determine whether the augmentation by cAMP of IGF-I-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of known IGF-I receptor substrates plays an important role in the cAMP-dependent potentiation of DNA synthesis induced by IGF-I. Pretreatment with TSH or dibutyryl cAMP did not affect the IGF-I-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). In contrast, cAMP pretreatment potentiated the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 induced by IGF-I, but did not affect the amount of IRS-2. We found that the IGF-I-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of 66 kDa Shc (Src homology collagen) was markedly increased by cAMP pretreatment, and that this change was mainly due to an increase in the levels of 66 kDa Shc protein. Under these conditions, cAMP pretreatment significantly increased binding of Grb2 (growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2) to Shc in response to IGF-I, and activation of MAP kinase (mitogen-activated protein kinase) induced by IGF-I was also enhanced by cAMP. The presence of PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK (MAP-kinase/Erk kinase), during treatment with IGF-I partially inhibited the cAMP-dependent augmentation of DNA synthesis in response to IGF-I. On the other hand, cAMP pretreatment increased binding of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) p85 subunit to IRS-2, which was reflected in PI 3-kinase activity. LY294002, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor, strongly depressed IGF-I-dependent DNA synthesis after pretreatment with and without TSH or dibutyryl cAMP. Our results suggest that the interaction between cAMP-dependent and IGF-I-dependent pathways leads to an augmentation of cell proliferation, which is mediated, at least in part, through the MAP kinase and PI 3-kinase signalling pathways. These effects are mediated by changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-I receptor substrates, including IRS-2 and Shc.
10919668	Activation of insulin-like growth factor I receptor signaling pathway is critical for mouse plasma cell tumor growth.	Plasma cell neoplasia in humans generally occurs as multiple myeloma, an incurable form of cancer. Tumors with marked similarity can be induced in mice by a variety of agents, including chemicals, silicone, and oncogene-containing retroviruses, suggesting the use of murine tumors as an informative model to study plasma cell disease. Herein, we have focused on the role of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) signaling in the development of plasma cell disease. The insulin receptor substrate 2/phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/p70S6K pathway was found to be either constitutively or IGF-I-dependently activated in all plasma cell tumors. Biological relevance was demonstrated in that plasma cell lines with up-regulated IGF-IR expression levels exhibited mitogenic responses to IGF-I. More importantly, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of IGF-IR in these lines strongly suppressed tumorigenesis in vivo. Taken together, these results demonstrate that up-regulation and activation of IGF-IR and the downstream signaling pathway involving insulin receptor substrate 2, phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase, and p70S6K may play an important role in the development of a broad spectrum of plasma cell tumors.
11146233	Expression levels of insulin-like growth factor binding proteins and insulin receptor isoforms in hepatoblastomas.	Hepatoblastoma, a rare pediatric liver tumour, is a poorly understood disease. While expression studies for some members of the Insulin-like growth factor axis have been studied in hepatoblastoma, a systematic analysis of the IGF-axis has not been carried out. We have examined a series of hepatoblastomas with matched normal liver tissue for gene expression differences with emphasis on members of the insulin-like growth factor binding proteins. The expression profiles obtained reveal that the expression of these genes are altered in these tumors. The results indicate that the IGF-axis is seriously disturbed in the tumors.
11704861	Regulation of breast cancer cell motility by insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) in metastatic variants of human breast cancer cell lines.	Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) regulate breast cancer cell proliferation, protect cells from apoptosis, and enhance metastasis. In this study, we examined the IGF signaling pathway in two breast cancer cell lines selected for metastatic behavior. LCC6 was selected for growth as an ascites tumor in athymic mice from parental MDA-MB-435 cells (435P). The MDA-231BO cell line was derived from osseous metastases that formed after intracardiac injection of the MDA-MB-231 cell line in athymic mice. Compared to the parental cell lines, IGF-I treatment enhanced IRS-2 phosphorylation over IRS-1 in the metastatic variants. IGF-I stimulated cell migration in the variant cells, but not in the parental cells. To determine the role for IRS-2 in IGF-mediated motility, we transfected MDA-231BO cells with an anti-sense IRS-2 construct. Transfected cells had decreased levels of IRS-2 with diminished IGF-mediated motility and anchorage independent growth when compared to control cells. However, adherence to fibronectin was enhanced in the transfected cells compared to MDA-231BO cells. Our data show that breast cancer cells selected for metastatic behavior in vivo have increased IRS-2 activation and signaling. In these cells, IGF-I enhances cell adhesion and motility suggesting that IRS-2 may mediate these aspects of the malignant phenotype.
8734453	Mutant insulin receptors in syndromes of insulin resistance.	To date, mutations of the insulin receptor remain the only well-established causes of severe insulin resistance. There is a broad correlation between the extent of impairment of signal transduction seen when the mutant receptors are expressed in vitro with the severity of the clinical phenotype. Thus leprechaunism, Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome and Type A insulin resistance appear to represent points on a continuum of severity of receptor dysfunction, rather than completely distinct syndromes. In other syndromes of insulin resistance, insulin receptor abnormalities remain the exception. However, functional studies of expressed naturally occurring insulin receptor mutations have acted as experiments of nature and greatly aided attempts to dissect the structure-function relationships of the receptor. The next few years will no doubt begin to reveal the contributions made by defects in the post-receptor signalling cascade to the syndromes of insulin resistance in man.
9468545	Receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase alpha specifically inhibits insulin-increased prolactin gene expression.	A physiologically relevant response to insulin, stimulation of prolactin promoter activity in GH4 pituitary cells, was used as an assay to study the specificity of protein-tyrosine phosphatase function. Receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase alpha (RPTPalpha) blocks the effect of insulin to increase prolactin gene expression but potentiates the effects of epidermal growth factor and cAMP on prolactin promoter activity. RPTPalpha was the only protein-tyrosine phosphatase tested that did this. Thus, the effect of RPTPalpha on prolactin-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) promoter activity is specific by two criteria. A number of potential RPTPalpha targets were ruled out by finding (a) that they are not affected or (b) that they are not on the pathway to insulin-increased prolactin-CAT activity. The negative effect of RPTPalpha on insulin activation of the prolactin promoter is not due to reduced phosphorylation or kinase activity of the insulin receptor or to reduced phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 or Shc. Inhibitor studies suggest that insulin-increased prolactin gene expression is mediated by a Ras-like GTPase but is not mitogen-activated protein kinase dependent. Experiments with inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase suggest that insulin-increased prolactin-CAT expression is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent. These results suggest that RPTPalpha may be a physiological regulator of insulin action.
10573543	Insulin receptor at the mouse hepatocyte nucleus after a glucose meal induces dephosphorylation of a 30-kDa transcription factor and a concomitant increase in malic enzyme gene expression.	Insulin receptor translocation to the nucleus may represent a mechanism for activation of transcription factors controlling lipogenic gene expression in the mouse hepatocyte. Insulin stimulation was achieved in vivo by oral glucose feeding of mice deprived of food for 24 h. Hepatocytes were fractionated after the glucose meal and nuclei were purified. Insulin receptor levels and phosphorylation state in nuclei were assessed by immunoassay. Insulin receptor significantly increased from basal levels in hepatocyte nuclei within 15 min of the glucose meal. Immunoassay using antiphosphotyrosine indicated that phosphorylation of nuclear insulin receptor increased, whereas phosphorylation of a 30-kDa DNA-binding protein significantly decreased within 15 min of the glucose meal. Glucose treatment significantly increased expression of malic enzyme within the time frame of insulin receptor translocation to the nucleus. Nuclear protein binding to an insulin response element (IRE) within the malic enzyme gene promoter significantly increased within 15 min of the glucose meal. When cell nuclei were isolated from mice that had been deprived of food and treated in vitro with purified, activated insulin receptor, changes were observed in DNA-binding protein phosphorylation and IRE-binding in the absence of cytoplasmic insulin signaling. In vitro incubation of nuclei with activated insulin receptor significantly decreased phosphorylation of a 30-kDa DNA-binding protein compared with basal levels. Increased binding of nuclear proteins to malic enzyme IRE was observed upon stimulation of isolated nuclei with activated insulin receptor. These results suggest that nuclear insulin receptors induce malic enzyme gene expression by regulating phosphorylation of IRE transcription factors.
1341258	Intra-rectal injection of tumour cells: a novel animal model of rectal cancer.	The purpose of this study was to develop an animal model of rectal cancer. Three murine-derived cell lines, B16 melanoma, CT26 and MCA38 colon carcinoma, as well as the human colon cancer cell line LS174T were injected into the submucosa of the mouse rectum. Subcutaneous CT26 anbd B16 tumours and intra-caecal CT26 tumours served as controls for tumourigenicity of the cell lines. B16 melanoma produced a locally aggressive rectal tumour as well as skin and para-aortic lymph node metastases. CT26 produced local tumour when injected intra-rectally and colon tumours and liver metastases when injected into the caecum. MCA38 and LS174T intra-rectal injections resulted in large rectal carcinomas without metastases. We believe that growth of a colon cancer cell line in the rectum approximates the human disease more closely than other models of colorectal cancer. We would expect that the model could similarly be utilized to assess the effects of novel adjuvant treatments for rectal cancer as well as in the study of the tumour biology of rectal cancer.
8257452	The binding of very low density lipoprotein remnants to the low density lipoprotein receptor in familial defective apolipoprotein B-100.	We have compared the affinity for low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors of LDL and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) remnants from patients with familial defective apo B-100 (FDB) with that of LDL and VLDL remnants from normal subjects. The binding affinity of FDB LDL was markedly reduced in all 14 FDB patients examined, hut the affinity of FDB remnants did not differ significantly from that of remnants prepared from normal subjects. Since the mutant form of apo B-100 present in FDB is recognized by LDL receptors with greatly reduced efficiency, we suggest that apo B plays only a minor role in the receptor-mediated uptake of VLDL remnants by the liver in man. These results are consistent with our previous suggestion that the ability of drugs that stimulate hepatic receptor activity to lower the plasma LDL level in FDB is due in part to increased hepatic uptake of lipoprotein precursors of LDL, including remnant particles with normal apo B-100 and those with mutant apo B-100.
8751588	Expression of the somatostatin receptor subtype-2 gene predicts response of human pancreatic cancer to octreotide.	BACKGROUND: Somatostatin inhibits proliferation of many solid tumors. The current study examines whether inhibition of the growth of pancreatic cancer by the somatostatin analog, octreotide, requires tumor expression of somatostatin receptors. METHODS: We studied five human pancreatic cancer cell lines, Capan-1, Capan-2, CAV, MIA PaCa-2, and Panc-1. Solid tumors were established in nude mice (n = 20/cell line) by flank injection of tumor cells. Subcutaneous octreotide (500 micrograms/kg/day) was administered by osmotic pumps to 10 of the animals in each group, and the other 10 received control infusions of saline solution. On day 36, the tumors were excised and weighed. Plasma levels of the putative trophic peptides cholecystokinin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and insulin were assessed by radioimmunoassay. Each of the five cell lines was assayed for the presence of cell surface somatostatin receptors by using whole cell competitive binding assays with 125I-somatostatin. Expression of the somatostatin receptor subtype-2 (SSR2) gene was determined with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions. Southern blot hybridization was used to assess the presence of the SSR2 gene. RESULTS: Octreotide inhibited tumor growth in the MIA PaCa-2 group (512 +/- 75 mg control versus 285 +/- 71 mg treated; p < 0.05) but had no significant effect on tumor weight in the other four cell lines. Plasma levels of cholecystokinin, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, and insulin were not altered by chronic octreotide infusion. Cell surface somatostatin receptors and SSR2 gene expression were detected only in the MIA PaCa-2 tumors. The gene for the SSR2 receptor was found in all five tumor lines. CONCLUSIONS: Octreotide-mediated inhibition of pancreatic cancer growth is dependent on expression of somatostatin receptors. The expression of somatostatin receptors should be considered in the design and interpretation of clinical trials with somatostatin analogs for treatment of pancreatic cancer.
11452214	[Insulin sensitiviy and lipids].	Insulin plays a central role in regulation of lipid metabolism, with different sites of action. In the adipose tissue, insulin inhibits lipolysis via an inhibition of the lipase, leading to reduce the flux of free fatty acids into the circulation. Insulin inhibits the VLDL production by the liver. Insulin is a potent activator of the lipoprotein lipase, promoting the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (Chylomicrons, VLDL). insulin promotes the clearance of LDL. Indeed, insulin stimulates apoB/E receptor (LDL-receptor) activity and enhances LDL degradation via the LDL-receptor pathway. Insulin also plays an important role in HDL metabolism since it activates LCAT activity, it reduces PLTP activity and modulates the hepatic triglyceride lipase activity. Because of the key role of insulin in lipid metabolism, we can easily understand that all diseases with impaired insulin action, such as insulin resistance or diabetes mellitus, will be characterized by important lipid abnormalities, which are important factors responsible for the increased cardiovascular risk in the patients.
11751379	Loss of heterozygosity of the putative prostate cancer susceptibility gene HPC2/ELAC2 is uncommon in sporadic and familial prostate cancer.	The recognition that prostate cancer clusters within families has led to the search for prostate cancer susceptibility genes. Recently, the HPC2/ELAC2 gene on chromosome 17p has been identified as a potential prostate cancer predisposition gene using both family based as well as case-control studies. Many cancer susceptibility genes act as tumor suppressor genes in which inactivation of one allele in the tumor can be detected via loss of heterozygosity (LOH). To determine whether the HPC2/ELAC2 gene demonstrates significant LOH in sporadic and familial prostate cancers, paired tumor and normal DNA samples were isolated using microdissection techniques from 44 radical prostatectomy specimens. Cases were analyzed using a panel of markers in the following order: TP53-D17S969-D17S947-(HPC2/ELAC2)-D17S799-D17S936. LOH was observed in < 10% of cases using the four markers that map to the HPC2/ELAC2 region. However, allelic loss was observed at the TP53 gene in 25% of informative cases. Taken together, inactivation of the HPC2/ELAC2 gene via LOH is a relatively uncommon event in prostate cancer. Future studies will determine whether 17p LOH occurs in the subset of patients with an inherited mutation in HPC2/ELAC2.
7763265	A ser for Cys mutation in the extracellular portion of insulin receptor beta subunit impairs the insulin-insulin receptor complex internalization in CHO cells.	We investigated the effects of a ser for cys 860 mutation, located in the extracellular portion of insulin receptor beta subunit, on several receptor functions. CHO cells, stably transfected with the mutated cDNA, were used for this study. In the present paper, we show that the ser 860 mutation does not affect the 125I-insulin binding, but severely impairs the insulin-insulin receptor complex internalization. The kinetic analysis of internalization indicates that this process is inhibited at steps preceding the coated pit endocytosis. The beta subunit autophosphorylation of the mutated receptor is higher both in the basal and insulin stimulated states, compared with autophosphorylation measured in wild type insulin receptors. The ser 860 mutation impairs also the insulin receptor down regulation, thus suggesting an effect on the intracellular sorting of insulin-insulin receptor complex. On the basis of these results we suggest that the cys 860 plays an important role in insulin receptor lateral moving on cell surface, after insulin binding, and on the intracellular sorting to degradation pathways.
8955195	Genomic structure and mapping of human FADD, an intracellular mediator of lymphocyte apoptosis.	Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD)/MORT1 is a 23-kDa cytoplasmic protein containing a C-terminal death domain that interacts with the intracellular death domain of the Fas transmembrane receptor. Cross-linking of Fas mediates apoptosis in a variety of cells, primarily peripheral T lymphocytes, for which this pathway plays a major role in mature lymphocyte homeostasis. We report the characterization of the human FADD gene, which spans approximately 3.6 kb and contains two exons (286 and 341 bp) separated by a 2.0-kb intron. FADD was mapped to chromosome 11q13.3 by the independent techniques of PCR screening of somatic cell hybrid mapping panels and fluorescence in situ hybridization. In addition FADD was shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization to be amplified along with other 11q13.3 genes previously studied in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-134-VI, raising the possibility that overexpression of mutant FADD could contribute to poor prognosis and increased invasiveness of tumors. Its known role in apoptosis has made FADD a candidate susceptibility gene for autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome. Now that it has been colocalized in 11q13.3 with IDDM4, a diabetes susceptibility locus, alterations in FADD should also be considered as potential contributors to insulin-dependent familial diabetes. Elucidation of the map position and gene structure of FADD will make possible linkage and mutation analysis to study the role of this gene in human diseases.
9349574	Human thyroid carcinoma cell lines and normal thyrocytes: expression and regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-1 and tissue matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor-1 messenger-RNA and protein.	Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and tissue matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor 1 (TIMP-1) play an important role in remodeling the extracellular matrix in normal and pathological processes. The effect of phorbol-myristate acetate (PMA), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on MMP-1 and TIMP-1 expression was studied on highly purified thyrocytes and undifferentiated 8505 C, C 643, HTh 74, SW 1736 thyroid carcinoma cells compared with thyroid-derived fibroblasts. Messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were monitored by competitive semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) after 24 hours. Culture supernatants were assayed for free and/or complexed MMP-1 and TIMP-1 after 48 hours using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) systems (detection limit: <2 ng/mL). MMP-1 and TIMP-1 mRNA were present in all cell types, although thyrocytes showed MMP-1 mRNA levels near the detection limit. 8505 C expressed MMP-1 mRNA levels of up to 10(6) times those of the other cells analyzed. PMA and IL-1 increased MMP-1 mRNA in most cell types. TIMP-1 mRNA increased after treatment with PMA in all cells except 8505 C, whereas only slight effects were shown after IL-1 stimulation. MMP-1 protein was undetectable in normal thyrocyte cultures, but was secreted spontaneously by all cell lines ([ng/mL]; C 643: 15+/-7; HTh 74: 81+/-1; SW 1736: 13+/-2; 8505 C: 2097+/-320). There was a strong correlation between levels of MMP-1 mRNA and protein (r = 0.99, p < .0001). PMA and IL-1 increased MMP-1 secretion in all cell types after 48 hours. Fibroblasts ([ng/mL] 517+/-55) and the cell lines (C 643: 142+/-48; HTh 74: 115+/-13; SW 1736: 202+/-14; 8505C: 120+/-19) secreted TIMP-1 in unstimulated cultures, whereas only a trace amount was detected in thyrocyte cultures, even after PMA treatment. IL-1 upregulated TIMP-1 secretion after 48 hours in SW 1736, HTh 74, and C 643 cells. Our data suggest that in contrast to normal thyrocytes, dedifferentiated thyroid carcinoma cell lines are potential producers of MMP-1 as well as TIMP-1. High MMP-1 or MMP-1/TIMP-1 expression may play a role in tissue invasion of undifferentiated thyroid cancer cells.
9527274	Altered serum levels of insulin-like growth-factor binding proteins in breast cancer patients.	BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) has mitogenic properties for breast cancer cell lines and has been proposed to be an important factor in breast carcinogenesis. We hypothesized that differences in IGF-1 or its binding proteins might increase susceptibility to breast cancer. This case-control study was designed to investigate whether patients with breast cancer have altered levels of either IGF-1 or its intermediary modulatory proteins, the IGF binding proteins (BP). METHODS: Serum was collected from 90 patients (63 with breast cancer and 27 with benign breast disease) after an overnight fast and before surgery. IGF-1, BP1, and BP3 levels were determined by immunoradiometric assays. In a subset of 66 patients, Western ligand blots were also performed for a semiquantitative measurement of functioning BP levels. A forward stepwise logistic regression model to adjust for other confounding variables (age, menopausal status, parity, age at menarche, use of oral contraceptives, history of breast biopsy, family history of breast cancer, hormone replacement therapy, and body-mass index) was used in the multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Serum IGF-1 levels were similar in cases and controls. However, levels of BP3 (p < 0.001), BP4 (p < 0.01), and BP1 (p < 0.05) were significantly associated with risk of breast cancer. The level of BP3 was the most significant factor predictive of breast cancer. The odds ratio for breast cancer in women with BP3 levels >2066 ng/ml was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.05-0.55). Correspondingly, women with BP1 levels higher than 39 ng/ml had an odds ratio of 0.21 (95% CI, 0.07-0.68) for breast cancer. When considering only cancer patients (n = 63), decreasing levels of BP4 (p < 0.01) and increasing levels of BP1 (p < 0.02) were significantly associated with progesterone receptor positivity (PR+) in the tumor. The odds ratio of PR+ in patients with BP1 levels higher than 34 ng/ml was 7.49 (95% CI, 1.5-37.4). Better grade of tumor (well and moderately differentiated) was observed in patients with higher levels of BP3 (p < 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Distinct differences in BP profiles exist among patients with breast cancer and also among those with high-grade, hormonal receptor-negative tumors. These findings suggest that the bioavailability of IGF-1 as mediated by its binding proteins may participate in both breast carcinogenesis and selection of more aggressive breast carcinomas.
12213887	Relationship of insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2 genotypes to phenotypic features of polycystic ovary syndrome.	Insulin resistance is a key component in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and type 2 diabetes. Polymorphisms in the genes encoding the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins, IRS-1 (Gly(972)Arg) and IRS-2 (Gly(1057)Asp), influence susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. This study was undertaken to assess the influence of these polymorphisms on insulin resistance, glucose tolerance, and androgen levels in nondiabetic PCOS women. We studied 227 PCOS subjects including 126 and 48 nondiabetic white and African-American subjects, respectively. The IRS-1 Gly(972)Arg allele frequencies were identical in whites and African-Americans [0.95 (Gly) and 0.05 (Arg)]. The IRS-2 Gly(1057)Asp allele frequencies were 0.85 (Gly) and 0.15 (Asp) in African-Americans and 0.59 (Gly) and 0.41 (Asp) in whites. There was no association of IRS-1 genotype with any clinical or hormonal measure in nondiabetic white or African-American PCOS subjects. However, nondiabetic subjects with the IRS-2 Gly/Gly genotype had significantly higher 2-h oral glucose tolerance test glucose levels compared with those with Gly/Asp and Asp/Asp genotypes in whites or Gly/Asp genotype in African-Americans (there were no Asp/Asp subjects in our modest size African-American sample). These results suggest that the IRS-2 Gly(1057)Asp polymorphism influences blood glucose levels in nondiabetic white and African-American women with PCOS. Thus, individuals with the common IRS-2 Gly/Gly genotype may be at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
7642566	Insulin-like growth factor I receptor activated by a transmembrane mutation.	We constructed mutant receptors by mutating transmembrane Val922 of the human insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR). Assays of receptor kinase and autophosphorylation revealed constitutively augmented tyrosine kinase activity of V922E IGF-IR in both transient and stable expression. The constitutively active tyrosine kinase of this mutant was verified by promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) in the absence of IGF-I. In CHO cells stably increasing V922E IGF-IR, both IRS-1 phosphorylation and the IRS-1 associated phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity were stimulated in the absence of IGF-I to the level attained by 1 nM IGF-I stimulation of wild-type IGF-IR, whereas the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway was not activated under the same condition. In these CHO cells, V922E IGF-IR significantly stimulated glucose uptake but did not promote mitogenesis in the absence of IGF-I. We thus conclude that the V922E mutation of IGF-IR switches on the intrinsic tyrosine kinase and differentially activates the downstream pathways. This mutant is extremely useful in clarifying the turning-on mechanism of IGF-IR as well as the differential roles of individual downstream pathways of receptor tyrosine kinases.
8253716	Tumor necrosis factor-alpha suppresses insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor and its substrates.	Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) has recently been shown to induce insulin resistance. We have examined the possible effect of TNF on the early events in insulin transmembrane signaling. Incubation of the insulin-sensitive rat hepatoma Fao cells with 5 nM TNF for 1 h led to a 65% decrease in insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both the insulin receptor beta-subunit and IRS-1, its major cytosolic substrate. TNF-induced impairment of tyrosine phosphorylation was maximal at 0.5 nM and was not accompanied by any reduction in insulin binding. Sixteen hours of TNF incubation led to further impairment in insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins. Our findings suggest that TNF may exert its anti-insulin effect by interrupting the early insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation events, which are crucial to insulin transmembrane signaling.
10389840	No correlation of plasma cell 1 overexpression with insulin resistance in diabetic rats and 3T3-L1 adipocytes.	Membrane glycoprotein plasma cell 1 (PC-1) has been shown to be increased in type 2 diabetes and involved in insulin resistance through inhibiting the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, which was demonstrated using cultured breast cancer cells. However, other reports have shown contradictory results in Chinese hamster ovary cells and in vitro kinase assay. Thus, we considered it necessary to investigate the effect of PC-1 using highly insulin-sensitive cells. Here, we used two of the following approaches: 1) investigating PC-1 expression levels in insulin-responsive tissues in rat models of diabetes and 2) overexpressing PC-1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We found that PC-1 was highly expressed in insulin-responsive tissues, such as liver and adipose tissue, in normal rats. However, high-fat feeding or streptozotocin-induced diabetes did not change its expression levels in liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. Thus, PC-1 expression levels were not associated with high-fat-diet-induced insulin resistance or hyperglycemia. Although PC-1 was increased in adipose tissue in Zucker fatty rats (protein level, by 50%; mRNA level, by 90%), its expression levels in liver and skeletal muscle, tissues that are more responsible for whole body glucose metabolism than adipose tissue, did not significantly differ from those in normal rats. Next, we overexpressed PC-1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using an adenovirus transfection system. PC-1 expression was markedly increased to a level 16-fold greater than that in normal human adipose tissue, which is higher than the previously reported levels in diabetic patients. However, insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and glucose uptake were not affected by PC-1 overexpression. These results strongly suggest that increased PC-1 expression is not causally related to insulin resistance.
11500939	Regulation of the Akt/Glycogen synthase kinase-3 axis by insulin-like growth factor-II via activation of the human insulin receptor isoform-A.	Insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) plays a key role in mitogenesis during development and tumorigenesis and is believed to exert its mitogenic functions mainly through the IGF-I receptor. Recently, we identified the insulin receptor isoform A (IR(A)) as an additional high affinity receptor for IGF-II in both fetal and cancer cells. Here we investigated the mitogenic signaling of IGF-II via the Akt/Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (Gsk3) axis employing R-IR(A) cells that are IGF-I receptor null mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing the human IR(A). IGF-II induced activation of the proto-oncogenic serine kinase Akt, reaching maximal at 5-10 min. IGF-II also caused the rapid and sustained deactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (Gsk3beta), reaching maximal at 1-3 min, shortly preceding, therefore, maximal activation of Akt. Under our conditions, IGF-II and insulin induced 70-80% inhibition of Gsk3betaactivity. In these cells IGF-II also deactivated Gsk3alpha although less effectively than Gsk3beta. In parallel experiments, we found that IGF-II induced transient activation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (Erk) reaching maximal at 5-10 min and decreasing thereafter. Time courses and potencies of regulation of both mitogenic pathways (Akt/Gsk3beta and Erk) by IGF-II via IR(A) were similar to those of insulin. Furthermore, IGF-II like insulin effectively stimulated cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 to the S and G2/M phases. Interestingly, AP-1-mediated gene expression, that was reported to be negatively regulated by Gsk3beta was only weakly increased after IGF-II stimulation. Our present data suggest that the coordinated activation or deactivation of Akt, Gsk3beta, and Erk may account for IGF-II mitogenic effects and support an active role for IR(A) in IGF-II action.
12824904	Possible chemoresistance-related genes for gastric cancer detected by cDNA microarray.	To identify chemoresistance-related genes of gastric cancer, we utilized cDNA microarray technology. Thirty-five gastric cancer specimens surgically resected at our institute between 1998 and 1999 were studied for quantification of expression of 6300 genes by means of oligonucleotide microarray methods, and the results were evaluated in comparison with the chemoresistance of the specimens, which was determined by MTT (tetrazolium-based 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Inhibition rates (IR) were determined for cisplatin (DDP), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), mitomycin C or doxorubicin. IR of 60% or more was regarded as sensitive to each agent, and IR of less than 40% was defined as resistant. Clustering was successfully completed for DDP, resulting in selection of 23 candidates as DDP-resistance-related genes, including vascular permeability factor, 2 membrane transporting subunits, and retinoblastoma-binding protein-1. In addition, further selection of DDP-resistance-related genes was performed according to these criteria: 1) Expression of the gene can be detected in more than 70% of resistant tumors. 2) Expression can be detected in less than 30% of sensitive tumors. 3) Expression in tumors is more than twice that of normal mucosa in more than 50% of specimens. Then, metallothionein-IG and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) were identified as candidate DDP-resistance-related genes. When known DDP-resistance-related genes were analyzed according to the MTT assay result, families of glutathione-S-transferase and cyclooxygenase-2 genes were also evaluated as resistance-related genes. For 5-FU resistance, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and HB-EGF-like growth factor genes were also suggested to be resistance-related genes. The present study demonstrated that oligonucleotide microarrays can provide information regarding chemoresistance factors in cancer.
11076094	Cervical epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGF-R) and serum insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) levels are potential markers for cervical cancer.	PROBLEM: To ascertain if cervical epithelial epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) and serum insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) levels are potential markers for cervical cancer. METHOD OF STUDY: We tested cervical biopsies obtained from 18 controls, 3 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, 17 women with CIN II and III, and 12 women with cervical cancer for EGF-R using a quantitative immunofluorescent antibody assay. We measured serum IGF-II levels using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 20 controls, 26 CIN patients, 12 with cervical cancer before therapy, 5 with cervical cancer for < 1 year, and 9 others > 1 year after therapy. RESULTS: The levels of cervical EGF-R in women with CIN and cervical cancer were significantly higher (P<0.05 for CIN I; P<0.001 for patients with CIN II and III or cervical cancer) than in controls. Women with cervical cancer (P<0.001 vs. controls) or advanced CIN (P = 0.03) had elevated levels of serum IGF-II, while the women with CIN I had levels similar to controls. Women with cervical cancer in the post-therapy period had significantly lower serum IGF-II levels than the women with cervical cancer before therapy (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Cervical epithelial EGF-R and serum IGF-II levels may be used for the diagnosis and prognosis of cervical cancer.
8001287	Detection of familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 among patients clinically diagnosed with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in maritime Canada.	Familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 (FDB) is a genetic disorder resulting from a mutation in the apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B-100) gene, most frequently at position 3500, in which arginine is substituted for glutamine in the mature protein. This mutation drastically decreases the affinity of the mutant apo B-100 particle for the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, and hence decreases the clearance of cholesterol from the circulation. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), also a disorder of lipid metabolism, results from mutations in the gene for the LDL receptor. Both FDB and heterozygous FH occur at approximately the same frequency (1 in 500) among Caucasians and both produce clinical symptoms and signs that can be indistinguishable. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and subsequent restriction analysis have been used to detect the substitution at codon 3500 in the apo B-100 gene using mutagenic PCR primers. At least one proband from 10 unrelated families with a history of hypercholesterolemia was screened by mutagenic PCR for FDB. Only one of 10 patients demonstrated the mutation for FDB. The mutant apo B-100 allele was shown to segregate with other clinically affected family members. These results demonstrate that molecular analysis is essential to distinguish between FDB and heterozygous FH in hypercholesterolemic families.
8077048	Transcriptional activation of the urokinase receptor gene in invasive colon cancer.	The plasminogen activator urokinase promotes tumor invasion by converting plasminogen into plasmin, which degrades several extracellular matrix components. Urokinase can bind to a specific cell surface receptor, which leads to accelerated plasmin production. While there is good evidence indicating a role for this binding site in tumor invasion/metastasis, there is little information concerning the regulation of urokinase receptor expression in invasive cancer. To address this question a series of colon cancer cell lines, which demonstrate either a high or low ability to invade an extracellular matrix-coated porous filter, was characterized for receptor expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. The invasive cell lines possessed 10-fold more receptors than their non-invasive counterparts as shown by cross-linking experiments and by Western blotting. Northern blotting indicated that this disparity in receptor number could be largely accounted for by a different amount of steady-state mRNA encoding the binding site. However, neither gene amplification nor enhanced mRNA stability could account for the augmented receptor protein observed for the invasive colon cancer cell types. In contrast, nuclear run-on experiments with representative cell lines revealed that the 10-fold difference in receptor display between the invasive-competent and invasive-deficient cells could be largely accounted for by differences in transcription rates. Transcription of the u-PAR gene in the receptor-deficient GEO cells, but not in the receptor-rich RKO cells, could be augmented by protein kinase C stimulation. These findings provide a clear rationale for studies to determine if the urokinase receptor promoter in invasive colon cancer is activated in cis or in trans.
10760951	Insulin-induced gene 33 mRNA expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells is insulin receptor dependent.	Gene 33 (g33) is a non-tissue-specific gene regulated in rat liver and hepatoma cells by insulin and other agents. It is thought to participate in the transition from quiescence to proliferation in mitogen-treated cells. The mechanism(s) by which insulin exerts its action on g33 are not totally understood; it is unclear whether a functional insulin receptor is required for this action. In this study, we evaluate the mechanism for insulin induction of g33 mRNA in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the neomycin-resistant plasmid (CHONeoB), human insulin receptor (CHONewIRa), and a kinase-defective insulin receptor mutated at the ATP-binding site (CHOK1018A). Transfected cells had higher levels of insulin binding than that of CHONeoB cells; insulin-induced phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and its intracellular substrates were impaired in CHOK1018A cells. Maximal insulin induction of mRNA(g33) occurred 3 h after hormonal exposure in all cell lines. The degree of insulin stimulation of g33 mRNA levels was four- to sixfold higher in CHONewIRa than in CHONeoB or CHOK1018A cells, which had minimal levels of insulin-stimulated g33 mRNA levels. Half-maximal stimulation of g33 mRNA levels was observed at 0.06 +/- 0.01 nM in CHONewIRa cells, consistent with insulin interaction with its own receptor. Wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K), had some effects on insulin stimulation of g33 mRNA in CHO NewIRa cells. PD98059, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated kinase kinase (MAPKK), and rapamycin, a p70 S6 kinase inhibitor, had minimal effect on insulin stimulation of g33 mRNA in all cells tested. By contrast, hydroxy-2-naphthalenylmethyl)phosphonic acid triacetoxymethyl ester (HNMPA(AM)(3), a selective inhibitor of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, caused complete inhibition of insulin stimulation of g33 mRNA levels. These data indicate that the insulin receptor with intact kinase activity is required for insulin stimulation of g33 mRNA levels. They also suggest that AKT, a PI 3-kinase downstream effector molecule, could mediate insulin stimulation of g33 mRNA. The mechanism(s) of insulin regulation of g33 expression downstream of receptor do not seem to rely entirely on the classic insulin receptor transduction pathway, as a minor effect was observed upon inhibition of MAPKK, suggesting that multiple pathways may be involved.
10862794	Redistribution of substrates to adipose tissue promotes obesity in mice with selective insulin resistance in muscle.	Obesity and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle are two major factors in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Mice with muscle-specific inactivation of the insulin receptor gene (MIRKO) are normoglycemic but have increased fat mass. To identify the potential mechanism for this important association, we examined insulin action in specific tissues of MIRKO and control mice under hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic conditions. We found that insulin-stimulated muscle glucose transport and glycogen synthesis were decreased by about 80% in MIRKO mice, whereas insulin-stimulated fat glucose transport was increased threefold in MIRKO mice. These data demonstrate that selective insulin resistance in muscle promotes redistribution of substrates to adipose tissue thereby contributing to increased adiposity and development of the prediabetic syndrome.
7860063	Two mutant alleles of the insulin receptor gene in a family with a genetic form of insulin resistance: a 10 base pair deletion in exon 1 and a mutation substituting serine for asparagine-462.	Mutations in the insulin receptor gene cause several genetic syndromes associated with extreme insulin resistance. We have studied three insulin resistant siblings with acanthosis nigricans, dental abnormalities, and acral hypertrophy. The female patient also had primary amenorrhea due to hyperandrogenism. All three patients were compound heterozygotes with two mutant alleles of the insulin receptor gene. One allele had a 10-bp deletion in the region of exon 1 encoding the hydrophobic signal peptide; this leads to a frameshift and premature chain termination at codon 61. The deletion occurs at the site of a direct repeat of a hexanucleotide sequence interrupted by a tetranucleotide sequence; the deletion may have resulted from recombination between the upstream and downstream hexanucleotide repeats. In the other mutant allele, there is a missense mutation substituting serine for Asn462-a mutation identified previously in one allele of the insulin receptor gene in a patient with type-A insulin resistance. The Ser462 mutation impaired the ability of acidic pH to dissociate insulin from the receptor. Thus, Thus, like the previously described Glu460 mutation, the Ser462 mutation may retard dissociation of insulin from the receptor in the acidic compartment of the endosome and may, as a result, accelerate the rate of receptor degradation.
9390006	Improvement of glucose homeostasis and hepatic insulin resistance in ob/ob mice given oral molybdate.	Molybdate (Mo) exerts insulinomimetic effects in vitro. In this study, we evaluated whether Mo can improve glucose homeostasis in genetically obese, insulin-resistant ob/ob mice. Oral administration of Mo (174 mg/kg molybdenum element) for 7 weeks did not affect body weight, but decreased the hyperglycaemia (approximately 20 mM) of obese mice to the levels of lean (L) (+/+) mice, and reduced the hyperinsulinaemia to one-sixth of pretreatment levels. Tolerance to oral glucose was improved: total glucose area was 30% lower in Mo-treated mice than in untreated ob/ob mice (O), while the total insulin area was halved. Hepatic glucokinase (GK) mRNA level and activity were unchanged in O mice compared with L mice, but the mRNA level and activity of L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) were increased in O mice by 3.5- and 1.7-fold respectively. Mo treatment increased GK mRNA levels and activity (by approximately 2.2-fold and 61% compared with O values), and had no, or only a mild, effect on the already increased L-PK variables. mRNA levels and activity of the gluconeogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) were augmented in O liver (sixfold and by 57% respectively), and these were reduced by Mo treatment. Insulin binding to partially purified receptors from liver was reduced in O mice and restored by Mo treatment. Despite this correction, overall receptor tyrosine kinase activity was not improved in Mo mice. Moreover, the overexpression (by two- to fourfold) of the cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) in white adipose tissue, which may have a determinant role in the insulin resistance of the O mice, was unaffected by Mo. Likewise, overexpression of the ob gene in white adipose tissue was unchanged by Mo. In conclusion, Mo markedly improved glucose homeostasis in the ob/ob mice by an insulin-like action which appeared to be exerted distal to the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase step. The blood glucose-lowering effect of Mo was unrelated to over-expression of the TNF alpha and ob genes in O mice, but resulted at least in part from attenuation of liver insulin resistance by the reversal of pre-translational regulatory defects in these mice.
9602534	The Croonian Lecture 1997. The phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine: its role in cell growth and disease.	The reversible phosphorylation of tyrosines in proteins plays a key role in regulating many different processes in eukaryotic organisms, such as growth control, cell cycle control, differentiation cell shape and movement, gene transcription, synaptic transmission, and insulin action. Phosphorylation of proteins is brought about by enzymes called protein-tyrosine kinases that add phosphate to specific tyrosines in target proteins; phosphate is removed from phosphorylated tyrosines by enzymes called protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Phosphorylated tyrosines are recognized by specialized binding domains on other proteins, and such interactions are used to initiate intracellular signaling pathways. Currently, more than 95 protein-tyrosine kinases and more than 55 protein-tyrosine phosphatase genes are known in Homo sapiens. Aberrant tyrosine phosphorylation is a hallmark of many types of cancer and other human diseases. Drugs are being developed that antagonize the responsible protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases in order to combat these diseases.
10485478	Altered ligand binding by insulin-like growth factor II/mannose 6-phosphate receptors bearing missense mutations in human cancers.	The M6P/IGF2R gene, encoding the insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II)/mannose 6-phosphate receptor (IGF2R), is frequently inactivated during carcinogenesis. M6P/IGF2R is postulated to be a tumor suppressor gene due to its ability to bind and degrade the mitogen IGF-II, promote activation of the growth inhibitor transforming growth factor beta, and regulate the targeting of lysosomal enzymes. In this study, we determined the effects of four M6P/IGF2R missense mutations associated with loss of heterozygosity in hepatocellular and breast cancers on the ligand binding properties of full-length membrane-bound receptors. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to prepare COOH-terminal, c-myc epitope-tagged human IGF2R cDNA expression constructs bearing point mutations that lead to the substitutions I1572T, G1464E, G1449V, and Q1445H, all of which are located in the receptor's extracytoplasmic domain. Ligand binding was measured in plasma membranes from 293T cells expressing full-length receptors. No binding of 125I-IGF-II to I1572T mutant receptors was observed. Binding to G1449V mutant receptors was decreased by 50% relative to wild-type (WT). However, IGF-II binding to the G1464E and Q1445H mutant receptors was equivalent to WT when plasma membranes were assayed immediately after preparation. The phosphomannosylated pseudoglycoprotein pentamannose 6-phosphate-BSA (PMP-BSA) was synthesized as a ligand for the M6P binding site. Binding of 125I-PMP-BSA was equivalent to WT for the I1572T, G1464E, and Q1445H mutations, but there was a 60% reduction in PMP-BSA binding to the G1449V mutant receptor. Thus, several missense mutations in M6P/IGF2R disrupt the ligand binding functions of the intact IGF2R, lending further support to the hypothesis that the M6P/IGF2R is a tumor suppressor gene.
10630585	Caloric restriction and experimental carcinogenesis.	Investigation into the influence of energy restriction in cancer has gone through 3 distinct periods. After the initial observation by Moreschi in 1909, there was about a decade of active research in this area. Then interest waned, possibly because the field had gone as far as it could, considering the knowledge and methodology available at the time. Interest was rekindled in 1940 due, principally, to the work coming from the laboratories of Tannenbaum at the Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago and Baumann at the University of Wisconsin. Another decade of active research followed. In this period, we learned how to design experimental diets and interest was expressed in dietary constituents. By 1950, publications on this type of research had dwindled and the field lay virtually dormant for 30 years. Since the early 1980's, research on this topic has blossomed and we now know enough about physiology and molecular biology to probe the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon. Energy flux, as in exercise, also inhibits carcinogenesis. Energy restriction modulates oxidative DNA damage and enhances DNA repair. It is now apparent that energy restriction affects adrenal metabolism (as hypothesized by Boutwell in 1949), insulin metabolism, and various aspects of gene expression. Understanding the basic mechanisms should provide important insights into control of tumor proliferation.
12031683	Amino acid transport in a human neuroblastoma cell line is regulated by the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor.	Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-II stimulate cancer cell proliferation via interaction with the type I IGF receptor (IGF-IR). We put forward the hypothesis that IGF-IR mediates cancer cell growth by regulating amino acid transport, both when sufficient nutrients are present and when key nutrients such as glutamine are in limited supply. We examined the effects of alphaIR3, the monoclonal antibody recognizing IGF-IR, on cell growth and amino acid transport across the cell membrane in a human neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-SH. In the presence of alphaIR3 (2 micro/ml), cell proliferation was significantly attenuated in both control (2 mM glutamine) and glutamine-deprived (0 mM glutamine) groups. Glutamine deprivation resulted in significantly increased glutamate (system X(AG)(-)), MeAIB (system A), and leucine (system L) transport, which was blocked by alphaIR3. Glutamine (system ASC) and MeAIB transport was significantly decreased by alphaIR3 in the control group. Addition of alphaIR3 significantly decreased DNA and protein biosynthesis in both groups. Glutamine deprivation increased the IGF-IR protein on the cell surface. Our results suggest that activation of IGF-IR promotes neuroblastoma cell proliferation by regulating trans-membrane amino acid transport.
12612081	Regulation of insulin receptor signaling by the protein tyrosine phosphatase TCPTP.	"The human protein tyrosine phosphatase TCPTP exists as two forms: an endoplasmic reticulum-targeted 48-kDa form (TC48) and a nuclear 45-kDa form (TC45). Although targeted to the nucleus, TC45 can exit in response to specific stimuli to dephosphorylate cytoplasmic substrates. In this study, we investigated the downregulation of insulin receptor (IR) signaling by TCPTP. In response to insulin stimulation, the TC48-D182A and TC45-D182A ""substrate-trapping"" mutants formed stable complexes with the endogenous tyrosine-phosphorylated IR beta-subunit in 293 cells. Moreover, in response to insulin stimulation, the TC45-D182A mutant accumulated in the cytoplasm of cells overexpressing the IR and in part colocalized with the IR beta-subunit at the cell periphery. These results indicate that the IR may serve as a cellular substrate for both TC48 and TC45. In immortalized TCPTP(-/-) murine embryo fibroblasts, insulin-induced IR beta-subunit tyrosine phosphorylation and protein kinase PKB/Akt activation were enhanced relative to the values in TCPTP(+/+) cells. Importantly, the expression of TC45 or TC48 to physiological levels suppressed the enhanced insulin-induced signaling in TCPTP(-/-) cells. These results indicate that the differentially localized variants of TCPTP may dephosphorylate the IR and downregulate insulin-induced signaling in vivo."
7716548	Mutations in the sulfonylurea receptor gene in familial persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy.	Familial persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by unregulated insulin secretion, is linked to chromosome 11p14-15.1. The newly cloned high-affinity sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) gene, a regulator of insulin secretion, was mapped to 11p15.1 by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization. Two separate SUR gene splice site mutations, which segregated with disease phenotype, were identified in affected individuals from nine different families. Both mutations resulted in aberrant processing of the RNA sequence and disruption of the putative second nucleotide binding domain of the SUR protein. Abnormal insulin secretion in PHHI appears to be caused by mutations in the SUR gene.
8242614	Identification of three regions on chromosome 17q in primary human breast carcinomas which are frequently deleted.	We have examined the long arm of chromosome 17 in sporadic breast carcinomas for the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 18 polymorphic loci. At least three distinct regions could be identified by the frequency of LOH and confirmed by high density deletion maps of individual tumor DNAs. A proximal region affected by LOH is located in a 22-cM region defined by D17S73 and NME1 and thus is similar in location to the region thought to contain the BRCA1 gene associated with familial breast and breast/ovarian cancer. The central region affected by LOH is bordered by the D17S86 and D17S21 loci and is estimated to be 28 cM in size. The third region is bordered by the D17S20 and D17S77 loci which are 11 cM apart. These results define three independent regions of chromosome 17q which are likely to contain tumor suppressor genes relevant to the etiology of sporadic breast carcinoma.
9062343	Development of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in the double knockout mice with disruption of insulin receptor substrate-1 and beta cell glucokinase genes. Genetic reconstitution of diabetes as a polygenic disease.	Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is considered a polygenic disorder in which insulin resistance and insulin secretory defect are the major etiologic factors. Homozygous mice with insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) gene knockout showed normal glucose tolerance associated with insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia. Heterozygous mice with beta cell glucokinase (GK) gene knockout showed impaired glucose tolerance due to decreased insulin secretion to glucose. To elucidate the interplay between insulin resistance and insulin secretory defect for the development of NIDDM, we generated double knockout mice with disruption of IRS-1 and beta cell GK genes by crossing the mice with each of the single gene knockout. The double knockout mice developed overt diabetes. Blood glucose levels 120 min after intraperitoneal glucose load (1.5 mg/g body wt) were 108 +/- 24 (wild type), 95 +/- 26 (IRS-1 knockout), 159 +/- 68 (GK knockout), and 210 +/- 38 (double knockout) mg/dl (mean +/- SD) (double versus wild type, IRS-1, or GK; P < 0.01). The double knockout mice showed fasting hyperinsulinemia and selective hyperplasia of the beta cells as the IRS-1 knockout mice (fasting insulin levels: 0.38 +/- 0.30 [double knockout], 0.35 +/- 0.27 [IRS-1 knockout] versus 0.25 +/- 0.12 [wild type] ng/ml) (proportion of areas of insulin-positive cells to the pancreas: 1.18 +/- 0.68%; P < 0.01 [double knockout], 1.20 +/- 0.93%; P < 0.05 [IRS-1 knockout] versus 0.54 +/- 0.26% [wild type]), but impaired insulin secretion to glucose (the ratio of increment of insulin to that of glucose during the first 30 min after load: 31 [double knockout] versus 163 [wild type] or 183 [IRS-1 knockout] ng insulin/mg glucose x 10(3)). In conclusion, the genetic abnormalities, each of which is nondiabetogenic by itself, cause overt diabetes if they coexist. This report provides the first genetic reconstitution of NIDDM as a polygenic disorder in mice.
10393088	Upstream stimulatory factor regulates Pdx-1 gene expression in differentiated pancreatic beta-cells.	The homeobox gene Pdx-1 plays a key role in the development of the pancreas. In the adult, however, expression of the Pdx-1 gene is restricted to pancreatic beta-cells and endocrine cells of duodenal epithelium. Recently, the transcription factor, upstream stimulatory factor (USF), has been shown to bind in vitro to a mutationally sensitive E-box motif within the 5'-flanking region of the Pdx-1 gene [Sharma, Leonard, Lee, Chapman, Leiter and Montminy (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 2294-2299]. In the present study, we show that USF not only binds to the Pdx-1 gene promoter but also functionally regulates the expression of the Pdx-1 gene in differentiated pancreatic beta-cells. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a dominant negative form of USF2 decreased binding of endogenous USF to the E-box element by approximately 90%. This reduction in endogenous USF binding led to a greater than 50% decrease in Pdx-1 gene promoter activity, which, in turn, resulted in marked reductions in Pdx-1 mRNA and protein levels. Importantly, the lower Pdx-1 protein levels led to a greater than 50% reduction in Pdx-1 binding activity to the A3 element on the insulin gene promoter, and a significant reduction in insulin mRNA levels. Overall, our results show that USF functionally regulates Pdx-1 gene expression in differentiated pancreatic beta-cells and provide the first functional data for a role of USF in the regulation of a normal cellular gene.
10612799	Prevalence of germline truncating mutations in ATM in women with a second breast cancer after radiation therapy for a contralateral tumor.	Patients treated with conservative surgery and radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer develop a contralateral breast cancer at a rate of approximately 0.75% per year. Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) and cancer susceptibility. Epidemiologic studies have suggested that AT carriers, who comprise 1% of the population, may be at an increased risk for developing breast cancer, particularly after exposure to IR. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed blood samples from 57 patients who developed a contralateral breast cancer at least 6 months after completion of radiation therapy for an initial breast tumor. A cDNA-based truncation assay in yeast was used to test for heterozygous mutations in the ATM gene, which is responsible for AT. No mutations were detected. Our findings fail to support the hypothesis that AT carriers account for a significant fraction of breast cancer cases arising in women after exposure to radiation. Genes Chromosomes Cancer 27:124-129, 2000.
11986190	A population-based study of the extent of surgical resection of potentially curable colon cancer.	BACKGROUND: We attempted to determine factors contributing to the extent of initial curative resection for colon cancer in a population-based cohort. Total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (TAC-IR) may be considered for young patients or those with a colorectal cancer family history to prevent metachronous lesions and facilitate surveillance. METHODS: All Ontario patients newly diagnosed with colon cancer over 12 months beginning in July 1997 were staged at the time of surgery. The extent of resection was compared with variables, including familial risk obtained from the Ontario Familial Colon Cancer Registry. RESULTS: Complete staging was possible for 86% of patients. A total of 1223 patients had a potentially curative resection: 17%, 46%, and 36% were stage I, II, and III, respectively. Patients were more likely to receive a TAC-IR if they were < or = 50 years old (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-6.6), if they had a synchronous lesion (OR, 28.37; 95% CI, 12.2-61.2), or if they were at a teaching hospital (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.6-4.7), but not if they had a family history (OR,.7; 95% CI,.3- 1.5). CONCLUSIONS: Young age, teaching hospital, and multiple cancers but not family history were important factors for performing a TAC-IR.
11238520	Novel promoter polymorphism in insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3: correlation with serum levels and interaction with known regulators.	Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) is a major determinant of circulating levels of the IGFs and is clinically useful for the evaluation of GH deficiency and for predicting the response to GH treatment. Recent studies provide evidence that the circulating level of IGFBP-3 is inversely related to the risk of several common cancers, and that antiproliferative agents such as antiestrogens and retinoids act in part by up-regulating IGFBP-3 gene (IGFBP3) expression. Although approximately 50% of the substantial interindividual variability in circulating IGFBP-3 levels is known to have a genetic basis, the specific loci involved are unknown. Direct sequencing of genomic DNA specimens from a multiethnic population identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region of IGFBP3. For the most common single nucleotide polymorphism (nucleotide -202) found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, genotype was highly correlated to circulating level of IGFBP-3 in 478 men from the Physicians' Health Study. In vitro, we documented significantly higher promoter activity of the A allele at the -202 locus compared with the C allele, consistent with the relationship observed between genotype and circulating IGFBP-3 (AA > AC > CC). A positive correlation was observed between circulating retinol levels and circulating IGFBP-3 levels; subset analysis by genotype showed that this relationship was only present among individuals carrying an A allele at -202 (AA > AC > CC). Tall individuals or individuals with a body mass index of 27 or greater had levels of circulating IGFBP-3 that were significantly higher when they possessed at least one A allele (AA > AC > CC). The IGFBP3 promoter region deserves investigation as a locus where polymorphic variation occurs frequently and may influence GH responsiveness, somatic growth, and possibly cancer risk.
12599422	[Comparative studies on the banding characteristics of insulin receptor in human hepatocellular carcinoma and adjacent liver tissues].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of insulin receptor in human hepatocellular carcinoma and it's adjacent tissue. METHODS: The human hepatocellular carcinoma and it's adjacent tissue specimens were obtained from 12 patients with histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma at surgery and were immediately frozen under -80 degrees C. Insulin was radioiodinated using Ch-T method. Cell membrane fraction of human hepatocellular carcinoma and it's adjacent tissue were isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Receptor binding of 125I-insulin to human hepatocellular carcinoma and it's adjacent tissue were performed. Binding data were calculated according to Scatchard using the ligand program. Statistical comparison was made with the paired t-test. RESULTS: The Kd values of human hepatocellular carcinoma and it's adjacent tissue were 2.12 +/- 0.62 nmol/L and 2.21 +/- 0.78 nmol/L respectively; the values of Bmax were 1.94 +/- 0.64 pmol/mg protein and 1.42 +/- 0.57 pmol/mg protein respectively. The Bmax value of human hepatocellular carcinoma was significantly higher than that of the adjacent tissue (P < 0.05), whereas the two Kd values had little difference (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that human hepatocellular carcinoma expressed denser insulin receptors than it's adjacent tissue, but there was no significant increase in the affinity of the carcinoma to insulin.
10344739	Association of breast cancer progression with a vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism. South-East Sweden Breast Cancer Group.	The vitamin D3 receptor gene (VDR) contains a TaqI RFLP that is associated with increased VDR mRNA stability, increased serum levels of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-D3), and decreased risk for prostate cancer. Determination of the TaqI genotype, in a group of young women with breast cancer (n = 111; age, <37 years) and a control population (n = 130), revealed no overall association to risk for breast cancer. However, patients without TaqI site (TT genotype) showed a significantly increased risk for lymph node metastasis (relative risk, 1.8, 95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.6). Furthermore, a tendency toward an increased survival was found among estrogen receptor-positive, tamoxifen-treated patients who were homozygous for the TaqI site (P = 0.075). We conclude that polymorphism in the VDR gene may influence tumor progression and tamoxifen treatment response in early-onset breast carcinomas.
11706428	p53 in the anticancer mechanism of vitamin E.	"Immunohistochemical techniques were used to study the expression of ""wild type"" p53 and ""mutant"" p53 in experimental cancer inhibition by vitamin E. The cancer model used was the squamous cell carcinoma of hamster buccal pouch induced by the carcinogen 7,12 dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA). Cancer development was studied sequentially for 8-14 weeks and specimens prepared for histological and immunohistochemical interpretation. Primary antibodies used were monoclonal antibodies for ""wild type"" and ""mutant"" p53. Specificity of antibodies was confirmed by flow cytometry. Peroxidase-antiperoxidase staining was used on the tissue specimens. In those animals receiving vitamin E the buccal pouch tumour development was significantly inhibited and there was a notable expression of ""wild type"" p53. There was also a relative absence of ""mutant"" p53 in the buccal pouch lesions of animals receiving vitamin E. These observations suggest that vitamin E may inhibit cancer formation by stimulating the expression of a cancer suppressor gene."
12603062	Linking molecular imaging terminology to the gene ontology (GO).	The rapidly developing domain of molecular imaging represents the merging of current advances in the fields of molecular biology and imaging research. Despite this merger, an information gap continues to exist between the scientists who discover new gene products and the imaging scientists who can exploit this information. The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium seeks to provide a set of structured terminologies for the conceptual annotation of gene product function, process and location in databases. However, no such structured set of concept-oriented terminology exists for the molecular imaging domain. Since the purpose of GO is to capture the information about the role of gene products, we propose that the mapping of GO's established ontological concepts to a molecular imaging terminology will provide the necessary bridge to fill the information gap between the two fields. We have extracted terms and definitions from an already published molecular imaging glossary as well as molecular imaging research articles, and developed molecular imaging concepts. We then mapped our molecular imaging concepts to the existing gene ontology concepts as a method to comprehensively represent molecular imaging.
8242621	Topoisomerase II inhibition and altered kinetics of formation and repair of nitrosourea and cisplatin-induced DNA interstrand cross-links and cytotoxicity in human glioblastoma cells.	By altering the accessibility of DNA sequences for alkylation or platination, and/or for subsequent repair, topoisomerase II can potentially affect the level of DNA interstrand cross-links induced in cells by bifunctional agents. In this study, we investigated the extent to which inhibition of topoisomerase II activity in a human glioblastoma multiforme cell line alters the kinetics of both the formation and the repair of total genomic DNA interstrand cross-links, as well as the sensitivity of the tumor cells to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II (cis-DDP) and 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU). Cells were incubated with and without 200 microM novobiocin, a known topoisomerase II inhibitor, for 24 h, followed by exposure to 50 microM BCNU and 25 microM cis-DDP. DNA interstrand cross-linking was determined at various time points over 72 h, using a modified ethidium bromide-DNA binding assay. Sensitivity of the cells to cis-DDP and BCNU was also determined with and without novobiocin pretreatment with 200 microM novobiocin. This concentration of novobiocin showed no significant direct cytotoxicity, although it inhibited topoisomerase II activity in tumor cell nuclear extracts by 73%. A significant decrease in the rate of repair of both cis-DDP and BCNU induced DNA interstrand cross-links, with a corresponding decrease in the clonogenic survival of the cells, was observed following novobiocin exposure. Although the peak cross-link indices of novobiocin-treated cells relative to controls were not significantly increased, residual DNA cross-linking in the cells after 72 h was increased by 1.4-fold for BCNU and 3-fold for cells treated with cis-DDP, thus, indicating a greater effect of topoisomerase II on cross-link repair than on cross-link formation. These data suggest that inhibition of topoisomerase II may provide a potentially effective clinical strategy for sensitizing human brain tumors, and possibly other tumors as well, to DNA cross-linking anticancer agents.
11373480	Sustained endotoxemia leads to marked down-regulation of early steps in the insulin-signaling cascade.	OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of sustained, 3-day endotoxin infusion on early steps of the insulin-signaling pathway in rat liver and skeletal muscle in vivo; to examine insulin signaling in well-established acute endotoxin models of insulin resistance. DESIGN: Prospective, controlled animal study. SETTING: University research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats: 24 in the 3-day endotoxin study, 22 in each acute endotoxin study. INTERVENTIONS: In prolonged endotoxemia studies, endotoxin (1 mg.kg-1.24 hrs-1) was administered via jugular venous catheter for 74 hrs. Insulin was then injected, and liver and skeletal muscle were removed after 5 mins. In acute endotoxemia studies, an endotoxin bolus (1 mg/kg) was administered, and insulin-signaling responses were studied after 4 hrs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In liver of rats with sustained endotoxemia, there were significant decreases in insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptors (74%), insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 (74%), and IRS2 (53%); binding of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase to IRS1 (80%); and IRS1-precipitable phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase activity (>90%). These findings were associated with significant reductions in abundance of insulin receptors (37%), IRS1 (60%), and IRS2 (23%). Signaling in skeletal muscle was similarly affected, with reduced IRS1 phosphorylation (49%), IRS1 abundance (50%), and binding of p85 to IRS1 (57%). Insulin signaling 4 hrs after endotoxin administration was not different from controls. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged endotoxemia is associated with marked deficits in early steps of the insulin-signaling pathway, which are at least partly explained by reduced abundance of the insulin receptor and IRS proteins. Signaling defects were not evident 4 hrs after endotoxin administration under conditions of adequate nutrition, indicating that insulin resistance develops gradually, may require concomitant malnutrition, and is not reversed by the development of endotoxin tolerance.
11709726	Insulin-like growth factor I stimulates motility in human neuroblastoma cells.	Motility is an important process that contributes to cancer cell spread. Growth factors are key regulators of motility in many cell types. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) causes SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells to undergo dynamic morphological changes, leading to the extension of lamellipodia. IGF-I stimulated lamellipodia extension requires signaling through both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and MAP kinase pathways. IGF-I, over a period of hours, stimulates SH-SY5Y and SHEP neuroblastoma cells to become more motile. While SH-SY5Y and SHEP cells use different insulin receptor substrate (IRS) isoforms to transduce signals from the IGF-I receptor, IGF-I has the same relative effect on the motility of both cell lines. Blocking the PI3-K and MAP kinase pathways attenuates the ability of IGF-I to increase motility. Overexpression of PTEN also attenuates IGF-I mediated motility. These results delineate some of the proximal events in the signaling mechanism utilized by IGF-I to stimulate cell motility.
7881103	Insulin-like growth factor mediated stromal-epithelial interactions in human breast cancer.	The prominent 'desmoplastic' or stromal reaction seen in many invasive breast carcinomas lead to early speculation that stromal cells play a role in breast cancer pathogenesis. Experimental evidence now supports this hypothesis and interactions between stromal cells and epithelial cells appear to be important for both normal mammary development and neoplasia. The identification of genes that are selectively expressed in the stroma of malignant breast lesions has recently provided new insights into the molecular basis of stromal-epithelial interactions. Stromally expressed genes include growth factors, proteases and extracellular matrix proteins, all biological activities with potential roles in malignant progression. Investigations discussed here concern the nature of the paracrine signals provided by malignant epithelial cells that activate changes in stromal gene expression, the effect that the stromally derived factors have on the behavior of malignant epithelial cells and the identification of novel factors and receptors in either stroma or epithelia that contribute to their mutual interactions. These questions will be addressed in the context of this laboratory's studies on insulin-like growth factors, as these molecules show marked differences in stromal expression between benign and malignant breast tissue and thus provide a useful paradigm for investigations into the paracrine environment of an evolving breast tumor.
8635102	The genetic attributable risk of breast and ovarian cancer.	BACKGROUND: The age-specific proportion of breast and ovarian cancer in the general population that is likely to be due to a breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility gene(s) is estimated. In addition, the age-specific penetrance of ovarian cancer for women predicted to be carriers of a susceptibility gene is calculated using population-based data. METHODS: Data are from the Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study, a population-based, case-control study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control, which includes 4730 breast cancer cases aged 20 to 54 years. Information regarding the occurrence of breast and ovarian cancer was collected for mothers and sisters of the cases during an in-home interview. The probability of being a breast cancer susceptibility gene carrier was calculated for each of the breast cancer cases using information on the family history of breast cancer. The calculated risk of ovarian cancer in the first-degree relatives of breast cancer cases with a high probability of being a gene carrier is compared with that seen in first-degree relatives of breast cancer cases with a low probability of being a gene carrier and used to calculate the proportion of ovarian cancer cases that are likely to be due to a breast/ovarian susceptibility gene(s) as well as the age-specific risk of developing ovarian cancer for gene carriers. RESULTS: Approximately 10% of ovarian cancer cases and 7% of breast cancer cases in the general population are estimated to be carriers of a breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility gene; these women are found primarily in families characterized by multiple cases of the early onset of breast cancer. The proportion of breast cancer cases predicted to be attributable to the gene decreases markedly with age; approximately 33% of cases age 20-29 years compared with approximately 2% of cases age 70-79 years. The proportion of ovarian cancer cases predicted to be due to the susceptibility gene ranges from 14% among patients diagnosed in their 30s to 7% among those diagnosed in their 50s. Carriers are predicted to have at least 15 times the age-specific risk of ovarian cancer of noncarriers. Among women predicted to carry the gene, the cumulative risk of developing ovarian cancer by the age of 59 years is approximately 10%. CONCLUSIONS: The estimates provided may prove helpful to clinicians until such time as large-scale population-based screening for breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes is possible.
11285324	Vitamin A deficiency reduces insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I gene expression and increases IGF-I receptor and insulin receptor gene expression in tissues of Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica).	The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system is regulated by various stimuli, including hormones, growth factors and nutritional status. We examined the effects of vitamin A on components of the IGF system in Japanese quail. Male quail (1 d old) fed a vitamin A-deficient diet for 14 or 21 d developed vitamin A deficiency, as confirmed by a depletion of serum retinol and hepatic retinyl palmitate. Consuming the vitamin A-deficient diet for 14 d did not affect growth rate, but decreased the serum IGF-I concentrations by 22% compared with the control group. The decreased serum IGF-I levels were accompanied by 21-52% lower levels of IGF-I mRNA in the testis, lung, liver and heart, whereas IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) and insulin receptor (IR) gene expressions were unaffected in these tissues. Continuous feeding of the vitamin A-deficient diet for 21 d retarded growth and further decreased the levels of serum IGF-I and tissue IGF-I mRNA. Serum IGF-I levels were reduced by approximately 50%; IGF-I mRNA levels were > 90% lower in the liver and lung and approximately 60% lower in the heart and testis. In contrast, levels of the IGF-IR and IR mRNAs were approximately 100% greater in some tissues examined. When vitamin A-deficient quail received a single injection of retinol or retinoic acid (0.1 mg/bird), tissue IGF-I, IGF-IR and IR gene expressions did not change after 4 h. These results suggest a possible physiologic role of the IGF system in mediating vitamin A-supported growth of Japanese quail.
12019176	Expression of the type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor is up-regulated in primary prostate cancer and commonly persists in metastatic disease.	The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) mediates tumor cell growth, adhesion, and protection from apoptosis. High plasma IGF-I levels predispose to prostate cancer, but there is no consensus regarding IGF1R expression in primary and metastatic prostate cancer. Recent studies in a human cell line and a mouse model suggest that metastatic prostate cancer cell detachment may be favored by impairing cadherin function via loss of expression of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), the principal IGF1R docking molecule. This may be accompanied by PTEN mutation, reactivating a key antiapoptotic pathway, and by IGF1R down-regulation to prevent Shc-mediated differentiation. We studied IGF1R expression in 54 samples of primary prostate tissue including 44 archival and 10 prospectively collected biopsies. We performed semiquantitative immunostaining for the IGF1R, IRS-1, and PTEN, and in situ hybridization for IGF1R. The IGF1R was significantly up-regulated at the protein and mRNA level in primary prostate cancer compared with benign prostatic epithelium. There was a trend toward increased expression of IRS-1 in the malignant biopsies. We also measured IGF1R, IRS-1, and PTEN expression in 12 paired biopsies of primary prostate cancer and subsequent bone metastases. In four cases, IGF1R and IRS-1 levels were lower in the metastases than in the primary tumors. Three of these metastases also lacked significant PTEN staining, compatible with findings in the model systems described above. However, this pattern was relatively uncommon, and 8 of 12 cases expressed detectable IGF1R and IRS-1 in both primary and metastatic biopsies. These findings challenge earlier reports of IGF1R down-regulation in metastatic disease and reinforce the importance of the IGF1R in prostate cancer biology.
12107268	c-Myc controls proliferation versus differentiation in human pancreatic endocrine cells.	Using immortalized human pancreatic endocrine cell lines, we have shown previously that differentiation into hormone-expressing cells requires cell-cell contact acting in synergy with the homeodomain transcription factor pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX-1). Although differentiation is associated with a decrease in cell proliferation, the mechanisms behind this relationship are not known. Using TRM-6, a delta cell line, and betalox5, a beta-cell line, we show here that cell-cell contact and subsequent endocrine differentiation lead to a down-regulation of the c-myc protooncogene. Overexpression of c-Myc obtained with an inducible c-Myc-estrogen receptor fusion protein results in an increase in cell proliferation and the ablation of hormone expression. Moreover, we show that although c-Myc is expressed in a subset of cells from the human fetal and adult pancreas, it is absent in differentiated endocrine cells. The mechanism by which c-Myc interferes with hormone expression may be through effects on the homeodomain transcription factor PDX-1, as immunostaining for PDX-1 in cells with activated c-Myc revealed a redistribution of PDX-1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. These results suggest that c-Myc plays a central role in a cell-cell contact-mediated switch mechanism by which cell division vs. differentiation in endocrine cells is determined.
12504093	Protection of insulin receptor substrate-3 from staurosporine-induced apoptosis.	In primary adipocytes, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and -3 are expressed in a comparable amount and play distinct roles in insulin signaling. To examine the roles of these IRS in apoptosis inhibition, we evaluated staurosporine-induced apoptosis in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing human insulin receptor and IRS-1 or IRS-3. Overexpression of both IRS protected CHO cells from staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Overexpressed IRS-3 as well as IRS-1 enhanced phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase activity in response to insulin and increased phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB) at S473 and phosphorylation of one of the members of the forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1 on T32 in both insulin-untreated and -treated states. Treatment of these cells with a PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 suppressed apoptosis-inhibitory effects of IRS-1 and IRS-3 as well as the phosphorylation of PKB and FKHRL1. These results indicate that both IRS-1 and IRS-3 take part in apoptosis inhibition through the PI 3-kinase/PKB/forkhead cascade.
8621519	Cloning and characterization of a functional promoter of the rat pp120 gene, encoding a substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase.	Cloning of the 5 -flanking region of the rat pp120 gene has indicated that it is a housekeeping gene: it lacks a functional TATA box and contains several Sp1 binding sites and multiple transcription initiation sites at nucleotides -101, -71, -41, and -27 spread over a GC-rich area. A fragment between nucleotides -21 and -1609 exhibited promoter activity when ligated in a sense orientation into a promoterless luciferase reporter plasmid and transiently transfected into rat H4-II-E hepatoma cells. 5' progressive deletion and block substitution analyses revealed that the three proximal Sp1 boxes (boxes 3, 5, and 6) are required for basal transcription of the pp120 gene. Promoter activity was stimulated 2-3-fold in response to insulin, dexamethasone, insulin plus dexamethasone, and cAMP. Although unaltered by phorbol esters alone, promoter activity was stimulated 4-5-fold in response to phorbol esters plus cAMP. Several motifs resembling response elements for insulin (in the rat phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene), glucocorticoids, cAMP, and phorbol esters as well as a number of putative binding sites for activating proteins-1 (Jun/Fos) and -2, and liver-specific factors were detected. The role of these sites in tissue-specific expression of pp120 remains to be investigated.
11223541	Molecular significance of excess body weight in postmenopausal breast cancer patients, in relation to expression of insulin-like growth factor I receptor and insulin-like growth factor II genes.	A number of epidemiological and clinical studies have revealed that excess body weight increases the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer and also adversely affects subsequent malignant progression. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these observations, we examined mRNA expression of various genes in normal (non-cancerous) mammary gland and cancer tissue of Japanese patients with primary breast cancer, in association with their body mass index (BMI). On the basis of analysis of 106 breast cancer patients, we found that mRNA expression of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) in the normal mammary gland showed a significant and positive association with increased BMI among postmenopausal patients. Furthermore, the positive association of increased BMI with IGF-IR mRNA expression was also found in postmenopausal breast cancer tissue, while this association was not observed among premenopausal patients. In addition, increased mRNA expression of cyclin D1 and bcl-2 was observed in association with increased mRNA levels of IGF-IR among the patients regardless of menopausal status. These findings suggest that the molecular consequence of the increased BMI is the increased expression of IGF-II and IGF-IR, resulting in development of postmenopausal breast cancer and its progression mediated through modulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis.
11640566	[Cancer between infection and heredity: genes, viruses and mice at National Cancer Institute (1937-1977)].	"After World War II, in the United States,viral explanation of cancer replaced a vision of the disease emphasizing genetic factors. From the mid 1950s onwards, experimental oncologists favored the notion that cancer was initiated by infectious agents passed from one generation to the next. In order to analyze this displacement, the present paper focuses on the part played by new experimental systems, i.e. mice showing tumors induced by viruses. Since animal models are agencies which ""represent"" human diseases, and mediate between different social worlds, their uses often result in opposing views. Mouse models thus provided tractable resources which favored the alternation between heredity and infection.  The paper describes the emergence, in the late 1930s, at the Jackson Memorial Laboratory, of an agent enhancing the formation of mammary tumors in mice. This laboratory was then involved in the production of marketable inbred mice as well as in research concerned with genetic factors that may cause cancer. After World War II, loose theories and conflicting results helped turn the agent into a virus. At the National Cancer Institute, the virus was associated with a whole range of particles causing leukemia in mice. Owing to the Virus Cancer Program, the value of mouse tumor viruses increased in the late 1960s. This research effort then aimed at finding human tumor viruses, and at crafting cancer vaccines. It was modeled after the experience of the NCI chemotherapy program stemming from war research. In addition to the fact that biomedical research became a state enterprise, the study emphasizes three parameters. First, loose practices--both theoretical and experimental--helped manage the variability of animal models. Secondly, the standardization and mass production of animals and reagents encouraged the stabilization of research programs. Thirdly, private biotechnology companies working under NCI contracts implemented preclinical work, and mediated between virology laboratories and clinical settings."
11742842	Determinants of leptin gene expression in fat depots of lean mice.	The relationship of leptin gene expression to adipocyte volume was investigated in lean 10-wk-old male C57BL/6J mice. mRNA levels for leptin, insulin receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in inguinal, epididymal, and retroperitoneal adipose tissues were quantified and related to adipocyte volume. Leptin mRNA levels were highly correlated with adipocyte volume within each fat depot. Multiple regression analysis of pooled data from the three depots showed that leptin mRNA levels were strongly correlated with adipocyte volumes (beta = 0.84, P < 0.001) and, to a smaller degree, with glucocorticoid receptor mRNA levels (beta = 0.36, P < 0.001). Depot of origin had no effect (P > 0.9). Rates of leptin secretion in vitro were strongly correlated with leptin mRNA levels (r = 0.89, P < 0.001). mRNA levels for TNF-alpha, insulin receptor, and glucocorticoid receptor showed no significant correlation with adipocyte volume. These results demonstrate that depot-specific differences in leptin gene expression are mainly related to the volumes of the constituent adipocytes. The strong correlation between leptin gene expression and adipocyte volume supports leptin's physiological role as a humoral signal of fat mass.
10793405	Genetics of type 2 diabetes mellitus.	Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous disease that is caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Only a minority of cases of type 2 diabetes are caused by a single-gene defect, such as maturity-onset diabetes of youth (mutated MODY gene), syndrome of insulin resistance (insulin receptor defect), and maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (mitochondrial gene defect). The genetic component of the more common form of type 2 diabetes is probably complex and involves the interactions of multiple genes and environmental factors. The candidate gene approach has identified several genes that regulate insulin signalling and secretion, but their contributions to diabetes are small. Recent genome scan studies have been conducted to identify major susceptibility loci that are linked with type 2 diabetes. This information would provide new insights into the identification of novel genes and pathways that lead to this complex disease.
11416012	Concerted transcriptional activation of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene by insulin and luteinizing hormone in cultured porcine granulosa-luteal cells: possible convergence of protein kinase a, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways.	Insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) can amplify gonadotropin-stimulated steroidogenesis by augmenting the expression of key sterol regulatory genes in ovarian cells, viz. low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, and P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A). The mechanisms underlying the foregoing bihormonal interactions are not known. Accordingly, in relation to the LDL receptor gene, the present study tests the hypothesis that insulin/IGF-I and LH can act via concerted transcriptional control of promoter expression. To this end, we transiently transfected primary monolayer cultures of porcine granulosa-luteal cells with a reporter vector containing the putative 5'-upstream full-length (pLDLR1076/luc) regulatory region (-1076 to +11 bp) of the homologous LDL receptor gene driving firefly luciferase in the presence or absence of insulin (or IGF-I) and/or LH (each 100 ng/ml). Combined exposure to LH and insulin (or IGF-I) stimulated LDL receptor transcriptional activity maximally at 4 h by 8- to 20-fold, as normalized by coexpression of Renilla luciferase. Further analysis of multiple 5'-nested deletional constructs of the LDL receptor gene promoter showed that deletion of -139 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site virtually abolished basal expression and promoter responsiveness to LH and insulin/IGF-I. In contrast, full basal activity and 60-80% of maximal monohormonal and bihormonal drive were retained by the -255 to +11 bp fragment. As LDL receptor gene expression in other tissues is negatively regulated by the abundance of intracellular free cholesterol, we assessed the impact of concomitant pretreatment of granulosa-luteal cells with an exogenous soluble sterol (25-hydroxycholesterol, 1 and 10 microM). Excess sterol markedly (50-70%) attenuated bihormonally and, in lesser measure, LH-stimulated and basal LDL receptor promoter expression, thus affirming a feedback-sensitive sterol-repressive region in this gene. Non-LH receptor-dependent agonists of protein kinase A (PKA), 8-bromo-cAMP (1 mM), and forskolin (10 microM) with or without insulin/IGF-I costimulation likewise augmented LDL receptor promoter expression with similar strong dependency on the -255 to -139 bp 5'-upstream region. To assess more specific PKA-dependent mediation of LH's contribution to combined hormonal drive, the LDL receptor (-1076 to +11 bp) reporter plasmid was cotransfected with a full-sequence rabbit muscle protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) minigene driven constitutively by a Rous sarcoma virus promoter. Expression of the latter PKA antagonist blocked transcriptional stimulation by LH alone as well as that by LH combined with insulin (or IGF-I) by 70-85% without reducing basal transcriptional activity. Transfection of a mutant inactive (Arg to Gly) Rous sarcoma virus/PKI gene confirmed the specificity of the PKI effect. To investigate the convergent role of the insulin/IGF-I effector pathway mediating bihormonal stimulation of LDL receptor promoter expression, transfected granulosa-luteal cells were pretreated for 30 min with two specific inhibitors of phophatidylinositol 3-kinase, wortmannin (100 nM) and LY 294002 (10 microM), or of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, PD 98059 (50 microM), U0126 (10 microM), or the latter's inactive derivative, U0124 (10 microM). Both classes of antagonists impeded the ability of insulin or IGF-I to enhance LH-stimulated LDL receptor promoter expression by 60-80%. In conclusion, the present analyses indicate that LH and insulin (or IGF-I) can up-regulate LDL receptor transcriptional activity supraadditively in porcine granulosa-luteal cells 1) via one or more agonistic cis-acting DNA regions located between -255 and -139 bp 5'- upstream of the transcriptional start site, 2) without abrogating sterol-sensitive repressive of this promoter, and 3) by way of intracellular mechanisms that include the PKA, phophatidylinositol 3-kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways.
12665509	Glucose regulates insulin gene transcription by hyperacetylation of histone h4.	Induction of insulin gene expression in response to high blood glucose levels is essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis. Although several transcription factors including Beta-2, Ribe3b1, and Pdx-1 have been shown to play a role in glucose stimulation of insulin gene expression, the exact molecular mechanism(s) by which this regulation occurs is unknown. Previous data demonstrate that the transcription factors Beta-2/NeuroD1 and Pdx-1, which are involved in glucose-stimulated insulin gene expression, interact with the histone acetylase p300, suggesting a role for histone acetylation in glucose regulation of the insulin gene expression. We report that exposure of mouse insulinoma 6 cells to high concentrations of glucose results in hyperacetylation of histone H4 at the insulin gene promoter, which correlates with the increased level of insulin gene transcription. In addition, we demonstrate that hyperacetylation of histone H4 in response to high concentrations of glucose also occurs at the glucose transporter-2 gene promoter. Using histone deacetylase inhibitors, we show that increases in histone H4 acetylation cause stimulation of insulin gene transcription even in the absence of high concentrations of glucose. Furthermore, we show that fibroblasts, which lack insulin gene expression, also lack histone acetylation at the insulin gene promoter. In summary, our data support the idea that high concentrations of glucose stimulate insulin gene expression by causing hyperacetylation of histone H4 at the insulin gene promoter.
9526524	Variable effect of streptozotocin-diabetes on the growth of hamster pancreatic cancer (H2T) in the Syrian hamster and nude mouse.	BACKGROUND: Streptozotocin-diabetes prevents induction of pancreatic tumors in several animal models and inhibits the growth of established human pancreatic cancer implants in nude mice. However, it also promotes growth of the hamster pancreatic cancer cell line, H2T, in the Syrian hamster. To test the hypothesis that these contradictory effects are due to tumor host differences, the growth of the H2T cell line was examined in the streptozotocin-diabetic nude mouse. METHODS: H2T cells were implanted subcutaneously into streptozotocin-diabetic nude mice (n = 10) and untreated control mice (n = 10). After 21 days, tumors were excised and weighed. Plasma insulin and somatostatin were determined by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: After 3 weeks, tumors in the control group weighed 118 mg and tumors in the diabetic group weighed 28 mg (p < 0.001). Plasma insulin was significantly decreased in the streptozotocin-treated animals compared with control animals (insulin, 23 microU/ml vs 31 microU/ml; p < 0.001). In contrast, somatostatin was significantly elevated in the streptozotocin-diabetic group compared with the control group (somatostatin, 179 pg/ml versus 54 pg/ml, p < 0.001). Competitive binding studies revealed specific cell surface receptors for insulin (Kd, 15.5 nmol/L), and somatostatin (Kd, 2.5 nmol/L) on the H2T cells. In an in vitro cell proliferation assay, cell division was promoted by insulin (p < 0.01, maximum +11%) and inhibited by somatostatin (p < 0.01, maximum -18%). CONCLUSIONS: The variable effect of streptozotocin-diabetes on pancreatic cancer growth is due to differences in the tumor host. The growth of pancreatic cancer, particularly in streptozotocin-diabetic nude mice, may be influenced by gut peptides in a receptor-dependent fashion.
9826208	Gene expression of insulin-like growth factor-I, its receptor and binding proteins in retina under hypoxic conditions.	Hypoxia is the main stimulus for neovascularization in the retina. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is thought to be one of the mediators of this process. Severe persistent hypoxia, as occurs in central retinal artery occlusion, is associated with less retinal neovascularization than relative hypoxia. To study the influence of different types of hypoxia on the IGF system, we used a model of neonatal rat retina that responds with neovascularization to a relative hypoxic stimulus produced by alternating oxygen concentrations in the respired air. We studied the influence of 24-hour hypoxia (10% oxygen), 48-hour hyperoxia (75% oxygen), and relative hypoxia (shifting from 48 hours in 75% oxygen to 24 hours in room air) on the gene expression of IGF-I, IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), and IGF binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 in retina using a solution hybridization RNase protection assay. Hypoxia induced a significant increase in retinal IGF-IR (178%), IGFBP-2 (227%), and IGFBP-3 (317%) mRNA; however, retinal IGF-I mRNA was reduced, as well as serum growth hormone (GH). Relative hypoxia caused a similar but less pronounced trend in the gene expression of IGF-IR and the binding proteins, whereas retinal IGF-I mRNA was unchanged and serum GH was elevated. Both hypoxia and relative hypoxia may cause IGF system stimulation in the retina through upregulation of IGF-IR and IGFBPs. This stimulation may result in neovascularization. However, during hypoxia, low levels of tissue oxygenation and reduced local production of IGF-I may impede the neovascularization process.
10510289	Angiotensin II inhibits insulin-induced egr-1 expression in mesangial cells.	The gene early growth response gene-1 (egr-1) encodes a zinc transcription factor involved in cell proliferation. Increased expression of egr-1 has been linked to heart and kidney disease. In mouse mesangial cells, insulin stimulated egr-1 expression more than angiotensin II, suggesting that insulin may play an important role in stimulating cell proliferation, leading to glomerulonephritis and diabetic nephropathy. Angiotensin II inhibited insulin-induced egr-1 expression but not c-fos expression, and the decrease in egr-1 expression was concurrent with a decrease in insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) tyrosine phosphorylation. These results suggest that insulin-induced egr-1 expression in mouse mesangial cells is downstream of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and activation of the MAP kinase pathway and that crosstalk between angiotensin II and insulin signaling pathways led to an inhibition of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and egr-1 expression.
11274053	Regulation of DAF-2 receptor signaling by human insulin and ins-1, a member of the unusually large and diverse C. elegans insulin gene family.	The activity of the DAF-2 insulin-like receptor is required for Caenorhabditis elegans reproductive growth and normal adult life span. Informatic analysis identified 37 C. elegans genes predicted to encode insulin-like peptides. Many of these genes are divergent insulin superfamily members, and many are clustered, indicating recent diversification of the family. The ins genes are primarily expressed in neurons, including sensory neurons, a subset of which are required for reproductive development. Structural predictions and likely C-peptide cleavage sites typical of mammalian insulins suggest that ins-1 is most closely related to insulin. Overexpression of ins-1, or expression of human insulin under the control of ins-1 regulatory sequences, causes partially penetrant arrest at the dauer stage and enhances dauer arrest in weak daf-2 mutants, suggesting that INS-1 and human insulin antagonize DAF-2 insulin-like signaling. A deletion of the ins-1 coding region does not enhance or suppress dauer arrest, indicating a functional redundancy among the 37 ins genes. Of five other ins genes tested, the only other one bearing a predicted C peptide also antagonizes daf-2 signaling, whereas four ins genes without a C peptide do not, indicating functional diversity within the ins family.
11478333	The relation of type 2 diabetes and cancer.	"Increasing evidence indicates that individuals with type 2 diabetes (diabetes) are at elevated risk for several common human malignancies, including cancers of the colon, breast, endometrium, pancreas, and liver. In particular, the consistent positive results reported by prospective investigations make it unlikely that methodologic issues, occult tumors, or chance results could explain the findings. Since diabetes and impaired fasting glucose together affect >25% of Americans above age 50, even a moderate etiologic association (e.g., relative risk = 1.5) would explain >10% of involved malignancies. Laboratory studies have suggested biologically plausible mechanisms. Insulin, for example, is typically at high levels during the development and early stages of diabetes. Activation of the insulin receptor by its ligand, or cross-activation of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor, has been shown to be mitogenic and promote tumorigenesis in various model systems. A ""unifying concept,"" in fact, holds that hyperinsulinemia may underlie the cancer associations of several additional risk factors, including high waist circumference, visceral fat, waist-to-hip ratio, body mass index, sedentary lifestyle, and energy intake. In this review, we assess current evidence regarding the relation of type 2 diabetes with cancer, and evaluate the findings in terms of well-accepted criteria for establishing causality."
12451676	[Gene diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease].	Alzheimer's disease(AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative diseases that causes intellectual dysfunction. AD is a genetically heterogenous disorder. Over 100 mutations have been identified in three causative genes, i.e. amyloid protein precursor(APP), presenilin 1(PS1) and presenilin 2(PS2) genes, for early-onset autosomal dominant familial AD(FAD). Apolipoprotein E(APOE) gene has been identified as susceptibility gene for late-onset FAD. The missense mutations in the causative genes lead to abnormal APP processing with overproduction of total A beta protein or A beta 42(43) isoform. The epsilon 4 allele of APOE gene is a genetic risk factor for sporadic AD as well as FAD. Parkinson's disease(PD) is another common form of neurodegenerative disease that causes movement dysfunction. Three genes, i.e. alpha-synuclein (SNCA), parkin(PARK2), and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1(UCHL1) genes, have been identified as causative genes for familial PD. The B mutation of CYP2D6 gene(CYP2D6*4 allele) is a genetic risk factor for PD. Lewy body(LB), that is an intracellular inclusion body characteristic of PD, is widely distributed in the cerebral cortex of 20 to 30% of AD patients. This disease entity is called as Lewy body variant(LBV) of AD. LBV shares the genetic risk factor with AD and PD, i.e. APOE epsilon 4 allele and CYP2D6 B mutation. Gene diagnosis is possible for familial AD and PD. APOE and CYP2D6 genotyping is also applicable to the future prediction of AD and PD, respectively.
7581745	Translational control of eukaryotic gene expression. Role of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor and chain initiation factor-2.	In mammalian cells, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF or eIF-2B) is a key regulator of polypeptide chain initiation. The exchange of GDP bound to chain initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) for GTP by GEF is a rate limiting step in protein synthesis. The multisubunit characteristics of GEF suggest that this protein is composed of several distinct structural and functional domains, and is regulated by allosteric means and by phosphorylation. The activity of GEF may be regulated indirectly by the phosphorylation state of the smallest subunit of eIF-2 (alpha-subunit). On the other hand, phosphorylation of the largest subunit of GEF (82-kD subunit) by casein kinase (CK) I or II stimulates GDP/GTP exchange. GEF contains NADPH which is required for structural integrity of the protein. Upon stimulation of cells by insulin and growth factors, allosteric activation of GEF by sugar phosphates and other effector molecules may also play an important role in the regulation of polypeptide chain initiation. In this article, recent information about structure-function relationship of eIF-2 and GEF in nucleotide exchange and the regulatory mechanisms that influence the rate of polypeptide chain initiation under various physiological and pathological conditions are presented.
8177860	[Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)].	Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a 37 amino acid peptide resulting from the specific maturation processes of calcitonin gene products, was discovered in 1982. Its messenger RNA was isolated from a calcitonin cancer in rats similar to the human thyroid medullary carcinoma. CGRP is closely related to calcitonin and amylin, and to a lesser extent, to the region coding for the alpha chains of relaxins, insulin and insulin growth factors. In thyroid C cells, calcitonin itself is the major gene product, but CGRP is predominant in the central and peripheral nervous system. CGRP is found in most all tissues and is considered to be a neuromediator of particular importance in the cardiovascular system. CGRP is a powerful endogenous vasodilator in man; plasma concentrations of 56 pmol/l (slightly above physiological levels) provoke flush, hypotension and secondary catecholamine release and subsequent tachycardia. Intravenous injections lead to systemic vasodilatation and redistribution of blood flow to the skin, the brain, and probably the splanchnic territory. It has been suggested that CGRP plays a role in blood pressure modulation in certain pathological conditions. CGRP level is decreased in hypertension and increased in septic shock. In patients with terminal renal failure, CGRP is correlated with excess volaemia. It could affect blood pressure by redistributing blood flow, interacting with the renin-angiotensin system or by inhibiting aldosterone secretion. CGRP may also play a role in modulating cutaneous vascular constriction in Raynaud's syndrome and cerebral vascularization in patients with migraine or meningeal hemorrhage subsequent to rupture of cerebral aneurisms. CGRP increases arterial flow in the cavernous body. Coronarian vascular tone and cardiac performance (positive chronotrope and inotrope effects) are improved. CGRP has also been studied in connection with glucose metabolism and may have other endocrine effects. Finally, CGRP increases electrolyte and water flow in the colon and its bronchoconstrictor effect could be implicated in asthma. The clinical significance of plasma CGRP is not yet known although it may be a marker of poor prognosis in thyroid medullary cancer. Recent studies suggest that CGRP could be a useful therapeutic agent in severe Raynaud syndrome, impotency, ischaemic neurological lesions due to ruptured aneurisms and in severe heart failure.
11156965	Transcriptional regulation of human insulin receptor gene by the high-mobility group protein HMGI(Y).	We have previously identified two closely related nuclear binding proteins that specifically interact with two unique functional AT-rich sequences of the 5' regulatory region of the human insulin receptor gene. Expression of these nuclear binding proteins increases during myocyte and adipocyte differentiation, and in other tissues appears to correlate with insulin receptor content. We have hypothesized, therefore, that insulin receptor expression in the insulin target tissues is regulated at least in part by these nuclear proteins. Here we show data on purification and biochemical characterization of these DNA binding proteins. Using a conventional chromatographic purification procedure combined with electrophoresis mobility shift assay and immunoblot analyses, a unique approximately 15 kDa protein, either identical to or highly related to the architectural transcription factor HMGI(Y), has now been identified, suggesting an essential role for HMGI(Y) in regulating insulin receptor gene transcription. Direct evidence of HMGI(Y) insulin receptor promoter interactions is provided by functional analysis with the CAT reporter gene and by hormone binding studies in cells expressing HMGI(Y) antisense RNA. In these experiments, antisense HMGI(Y) specifically inhibits insulin receptor promoter function and insulin receptor protein expression, indicating that HMGI(Y) is required for proper transcription of insulin receptor gene. Moreover, our data consistently support the hypothesis that a putative defect in this nuclear binding protein may cause insulin receptor dysfunction with subsequent impairment of insulin signaling and action.
7949223	Tissue-specific expression of two alternatively spliced isoforms of the human insulin receptor protein.	Two insulin receptor mRNA species are expressed in human tissues as a result of alternative splicing of exon 11. This event is regulated in a tissue-specific manner. To date, there is little information about the relative abundance of the two receptor protein isoforms on the cell surface. The aim of the present investigation was to assess whether the tissue-specific expression of the two insulin receptor mRNA species is paralleled by a similar pattern of expression of the two receptor protein isoforms. To this end, we assessed the relative distribution of the two receptor variants in various human tissues at the mRNA and protein levels. A PCR-based technique was used to measure the relative abundance of the two mRNA species, and two immunological assays were used to measure the relative steady-state expression of the two receptor protein isoforms. The expression of the two insulin receptor protein isoforms followed the tissue-specific pattern of expression of the two mRNA species.
8269616	Cellular and chromosomal hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents and topoisomerase inhibitors in the radiosensitive Chinese hamster irs mutants: phenotypic similarities to ataxia telangiectasia and Fanconi's anaemia cells.	The mutants irs1, irs2 and irs3 were previously isolated from the Chinese hamster line V79-4 on the basis of their hypersensitivity (2-3-fold) to cell inactivation by X-rays. Here the cross-sensitivities of the irs mutants to an array of chemical mutagens and topoisomerase inhibitors was determined in a differential cytotoxicity assay. Irs2 showed moderate hypersensitivity (2-3-fold) to simple alkylating agents and oxidative mutagens but was most sensitive (8-fold) to the topisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin. In contrast irs2 showed little or no increased sensitivity to four topoisomerase II inhibitors. Irs3 proved to be particularly hypersensitive to DNA crosslinking agents (5-15-fold) such as 1,3-butadiene diepoxide and mitomycin C. Irs1 was hypersensitive (3-fold or greater) to simple alkylating agents, oxidative mutagens and topoisomerase I and II inhibitors and exhibited extreme sensitivity (20-100-fold) to DNA crosslinking agents. The cellular hypersensitivities of irs2 and irs3 were reflected at the level of the chromosome. Camptothecin induced chromosomal aberrations in irs2 consisted almost exclusively of chromatid deletions and exchanges, whilst in irs3 1,3 butadiene diepoxide induced a 50-fold increase in chromatid exchanges compared with V79-4. The nature of irs2's camptothecin hypersensitivity was investigated. Analysis of the protein associated DNA single strand breaks produced by camptothecin indicated that there was no difference between V79-4 and irs2 in either the number of breaks induced or in the rate of their reversal following drug removal. In addition, levels of topoisomerase I activity in V79-4 and irs2 were indistinguishable. The data presented suggest that irs3 is likely to be defective in some aspect of DNA cross-link removal and irs2, whilst showing no gross defect in DNA strand break repair may fail to correctly respond to or repair certain types of strand breaks, possibly those associated with replicating DNA. The phenotypes of irs2 and irs3 respectively show similarities to those of cultured cells from the syndromes ataxia telangiectasia and Fanconi's anaemia.
11857924	[Leprechaunism caused by mutations in the insulin receptor gene].	Leprechaunism represents the most severe form of insulin resistance syndrome, manifesting abnormal glucose metabolism and intrauterine, postnatal growth retardation. Mutations in both alleles of the insulin receptor gene have been identified. Recombinant human IGF-I treatment could prevent postnatal growth retardation and normalize glucose metabolism, however there are few reports of long-term treatment with IGF-I. We have a case of compound heterozygous mutations of the insulin receptor gene, who has been treated with IGF-I more than 11 years. Relatively higher dose of IGF-I is necessary for maintaining sufficient serum IGF-I levels. After 10 years' treatment with IGF-I, polycystic ovary, kidney enlargement, albuminuria and retinopathy are complicated in this patient. In this review, we summarized basic actions of insulin and insulin receptor, classification of mutations in the insulin receptor gene, clinical feature and our results of long-term treatment with IGF-I in leprechaunism.
12218293	Local expression of insulin-like growth factor-I affects angiogenesis in colorectal cancer.	Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) has potent mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects that give it a critical role in the regulation of rapidly renewing epithelial cell populations such as those found in the colon. Recent evidence has implicated circulating IGF-I levels as an important determinant of colorectal cancer risk, but the role, if any, of its autocrine/paracrine expression remains unexplored. Therefore, we investigated the local expression of IGF-I and IGF-I type I receptor (IGF-IR) in 50 paired normal colon and carcinoma samples. IGF-IR mRNA was present in all samples, whereas IGF-I mRNA was detected in only 30 normal (60%) and 27 tumour (54%) biopsies. Samples that did not express IGF-I mRNA had no IGF-I peptide detectable by immunocytochemistry. The absence of local IGF-1 expression was associated with significantly reduced mRNA levels specifying the proliferating cell nuclear antigen and c-myc, as well as Cox-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor - gene products that regulate angiogenesis. The biological relevance of this finding is suggested by the significant association between local IGF-I mRNA levels and microvessel density in the colorectal cancers.
9786898	Posttranscriptional control of adipocyte differentiation through activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase.	Differentiation of adipocytes is an important aspect of energy homeostasis. Although the transcriptional regulation of adipocyte differentiation is relatively well characterized, the subsequent molecular events remain unclear. The activity of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase precipitated with antibodies to phosphotyrosine has now been shown to increase transiently during adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-F442A and of 3T3-L1 cells. PI 3-kinase activity precipitated with antibodies to insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and association of subunits of PI 3-kinase with IRS1 were also increased at this stage of differentiation, suggesting that IRS1 contributes to PI 3-kinase activation. Inhibition of the activation of PI 3-kinase by expression of dominant negative mutant subunits of the enzyme prevented adipogenesis, as assessed by lipid accumulation and expression of key adipocyte proteins such as GLUT4, adipsin, and aP2, suggesting that PI 3-kinase activation is essential for adipocyte differentiation. However, these mutant proteins did not affect either the expression of the transcription factor PPARgamma at the mRNA or protein level or the increase in the abundance of mRNAs encoding the adipocyte marker proteins. These results demonstrate that adipocyte differentiation is regulated at the posttranscriptional level and that activation of PI 3-kinase is required for this regulation.
10199143	[Syndromes of severe insulin resistance].	The syndromes of extreme severe insulin resistance are mainly caused by genetic defects of the insulin receptor gene (Type A syndrome, Leprechaunism, and Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome) or by the presence of circulating autoantibodies that disrupt the normal functions of the insulin receptor (Type B syndrome). These syndromes are characterized by the hyperinsulinemia and severe insulin resistance and in most cases accompanied by impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus. The clinical features common to these syndromes are acanthosis nigricans, hyperandrogenism and ovarian dysfunction. On the other hand, an important distinguishing typical feature in type B syndrome is evidence of other autoimmune disorders. [These syndromes can be a contributory causes of insulin resistance in a subpopulation with NIDDM.]
10614663	Coexpression of receptors for adrenomedullin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and amylin in pancreatic beta-cells.	Three receptors have been characterized by their ability to bind adrenomedullin (AM): L1, RDC1, and CRLR. Immunohistochemical analysis and RT-PCR showed that all three receptors are expressed by the insulin-producing cells of the islets of Langerhans. RDC1 and CRLR in the presence of particular modifying proteins can also bind calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Such data suggest that the inhibitory effect caused by both AM and CGRP on insulin secretion is mediated by a direct interaction with the beta-cell. We also identified receptors for amylin, the third member of the AM peptide family, in mouse insulin-secreting cells. The beta-cells located closer to the periphery of the islets had a stronger immunoreactivity for the AM/ CGRP receptors. This observation could be related to a paracrine mechanism, given the proximity of AM- and CGRP-secreting cells (F and delta-cells, respectively), which are located at the periphery of the islets. Interestingly, the smooth muscle cells in the pancreatic vasculature expressed only RDC1, which is in agreement with physiological data showing that AM functions in the cardiovascular system are mainly mediated through a CGRP1 receptor. These data further implicate AM and the other components of its peptide family as important regulators of insulin release.
11113206	Essential role of insulin receptor substrate 1 in differentiation of brown adipocytes.	The most widely distributed members of the family of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins are IRS-1 and IRS-2. These proteins participate in insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling, as well as the actions of some cytokines, growth hormone, and prolactin. To more precisely define the specific role of IRS-1 in adipocyte biology, we established brown adipocyte cell lines from wild-type and IRS-1 knockout (KO) animals. Using differentiation protocols, both with and without insulin, preadipocyte cell lines derived from IRS-1 KO mice exhibited a marked decrease in differentiation and lipid accumulation (10 to 40%) compared to wild-type cells (90 to 100%). Furthermore, IRS-1 KO cells showed decreased expression of adipogenic marker proteins, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), fatty acid synthase, uncoupling protein-1, and glucose transporter 4. The differentiation deficit in the KO cells could be reversed almost completely by retrovirus-mediated reexpression of IRS-1, PPARgamma, or C/EBPalpha but not the thiazolidinedione troglitazone. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) assays performed at various stages of the differentiation process revealed a strong and transient activation in IRS-1, IRS-2, and phosphotyrosine-associated PI 3-kinase in the wild-type cells, whereas the IRS-1 KO cells showed impaired phosphotyrosine-associated PI 3-kinase activation, all of which was associated with IRS-2. Akt phosphorylation was reduced in parallel with the total PI 3-kinase activity. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase with LY294002 blocked differentiation of wild-type cells. Thus, IRS-1 appears to be an important mediator of brown adipocyte maturation. Furthermore, this signaling molecule appears to exert its unique role in the differentiation process via activation of PI 3-kinase and its downstream target, Akt, and is upstream of the effects of PPARgamma and C/EBPalpha.
12553167	The molecular genetic basis and diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia in Denmark.	Normal function of the hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is obligate for normal levels of plasma LDL cholesterol. The LDL receptor regulates the concentration of plasma LDL cholesterol by internalizing apolipoprotein B-100- and apolipoprotein E-containing lipoproteins by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Mutations in the gene encoding the LDL receptor protein give rise to one of the most common classical autosomal dominant inherited disorders in man, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). The estimated prevalence of heterozygous FH is 0.2% (1:500) in most populations of the world including the Danish. Worldwide, an estimated ten million people are afflicted with FH and in Denmark there are approximately 10,000 subjects with heterozygous FH. Persons with heterozygous FH are characterized by a severely elevated concentration of LDL cholesterol in plasma starting in early childhood, tendon xanthomas and a markedly increased risk of premature coronary heart disease (CHD). Adequate control of plasma LDL cholesterol levels can be achieved in most patients with heterozygous FH, and to a lesser extent in the very rare cases with homozygous FH, using combinations of diet, drug therapy and selective LDL-apheresis. So, it is very important that physicians be aware of this relatively common disorder since there is good evidence that early diagnosis and cholesterol-lowering therapy will delay or even prevent CHD in persons with FH. A large majority of these persons, however, are still not diagnosed or adequately treated. It is believed that the diagnostic abilities molecular biology has to offer will provide the impetus for correcting this situation. The aims of the studies behind the present thesis, therefore, were to obtain important knowledge about current mutation detection technology, prevalence and spectrum of LDL receptor gene mutations in Denmark, methods to evaluate pathogenicity of LDL receptor gene mutations, relationship between FH genotype-phenotype, and clinical versus DNA diagnosis in the Danish FH population. Among different relative laborious and expensive scanning methods for unknown gene mutations we have shown that the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis is a highly efficient and sensitive technique for detection of mutations in the 18 exons including intronic splice-site sequences and the promoter region of the LDL receptor gene, reserving DNA sequencing to the exons revealing variant SSCP patterns. Southern blot analysis or long distance PCR analysis are necessary to identify large gene re-arrangements in the LDL receptor gene in FH patients in whom SSCP analysis did not reveal any smaller sequence alterations. Worldwide, about 700 different mutations in the LDL receptor gene have been reported and in the Danish FH population we have so far identified 60 different mutations localized throughout the LDL receptor gene. In certain populations a small number of mutations predominate due to founder effects. The spectrum of LDL receptor mutations in Danish FH patients is intermediate between such specific founder populations with 5 predominant mutations (W23X, W66G, W556S, 313 + 1G-->A, 1846-1G-->A) accounting for about 40-50% of FH. These frequent mutations can easily and inexpensively be tested for by specific PCR based assays using restriction enzyme cleavage. Future analysis of LDL receptor mutations in heterozygous FH subjects, therefore, should be based on the mutational spectrum present in each relevant specific subset. Most mutations in the LDL receptor gene cause the classical heterozygous form of FH, but a small proportion seem to result in mild or moderate forms of autosomal, dominantly inherited hypercholesterolemia. Differentiation between harmless sequence variations and disease-causing mutations is not always easy without additional work. We have experienced that large re-arrangements, frame-shift and nonsense mutations obviously are pathogenic, but full pathogenicity should not be ascribed to missense mutations and small in-frame deletions, e.g. the N543H and 2393del9 mutations, unless in vitro gene expression in eukaryotic cells have been studied, or to splice-site mutations, e.g. the 1592 + 5G-->A mutation, before mRNA studies in patient cells have been performed. The cumulated LDL cholesterol exposure, mainly determined by the defect LDL receptor, plays a crucial role for the clinical manifestation of FH. The phenotypic expression of homozygous FH appears to be dominated by the consequences of the LDL receptor gene mutations. In heterozygous FH, however, the underlying mutational LDL receptor type determines only to a much lesser extent, if any, the variable phenotypic expression as seen in Danish patients. Extreme low fat dietary habits or major gene interactions may influence the lipid profile and the excess cardiovascular mortality observed in heterozygous FH, whereas minor gene determinants do not seem to play any significant role. The clinical diagnosis of heterozygous FH should be based on an elevated plasma LDL cholesterol concentration above the 95th percentiles for the general population together with either the presence of tendon xanthomas or an autosomal dominant transmission of hypercholesterolemia in the family or a child with hypercholesterolemia. Our studies illustrate clearly that molecular genetics can strengthen an equivocal clinical diagnosis and assist decision-making in diagnosis and tracing family members. If demonstration of a pathogenic mutation in the LDL receptor gene fails, other causes of autosomal dominant inherited hypercholesterolemia should be sought. Familial defective apolipoprotein B (FDB) caused by the R3500Q apolipoprotein B gene mutation may mimic FH but the clinical course, however, is often milder than that seen in patients with LDL receptor gene mutations. A newly discovered third major locus at chromosome 1 may also be of future diagnostic importance although the exact gene remains to be identified. The overall molecular genetic knowledge obtained about FH in Denmark forms the basis for the implementation and use of molecular genetic diagnostics of FH in daily clinical practice.
7592607	Receptor-mediated internalization of insulin. Potential role of pp120/HA4, a substrate of the insulin receptor kinase.	pp120/HA4 is a hepatocyte membrane glycoprotein phosphorylated by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. In this study, we have investigated the role of pp120/HA4 in insulin action. Transfection of antisense pp120/HA4 cDNA in H35 hepatoma cells resulted in inhibition of pp120/HA4 expression and was associated with a 2-3-fold decrease in the rate of insulin internalization. Furthermore, insulin internalization in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts co-transfected with insulin receptors and pp120/HA4 was increased 2-fold compared with cells expressing insulin receptors alone. In contrast, no effect on internalization was observed in cells overexpressing a naturally occurring splice variant of pp120/HA4 that lacks the phosphorylation sites in the intracellular domain. Insulin internalization was also unaffected in cells expressing three site-directed mutants of pp120/HA4 in which the sites of phosphorylation by the insulin receptor kinase had been removed (Y488F, Y488F/Y513F, and S503A). Our data suggest that pp120/HA4 is part of a complex of proteins required for receptor-mediated internalization of insulin. It is possible that this function is regulated by insulin-induced phosphorylation of the intracellular domain of pp120/HA4.
8288055	An upstream element from the human insulin receptor gene promoter contains binding sites for C/EBP beta and NF-1.	We have shown previously that a 500-bp region of the human insulin receptor promoter (-0.3 to -1.8 kb) was able to stimulate transcription from a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter in HepG2 hepatoma cells but not in HeLa fibroblasts. Footprint analysis localized the transcription factor binding sites to a 36-bp region at -1420. In this paper, we analyze the factors that recognize this element and show that it contains binding sites for the CAAT/enhancer binding protein C/EBP and nuclear factor 1 (NF-1). In addition we show that both C/EBP alpha and the C/EBP beta can transactivate the human insulin receptor promoter in a dose-dependent manner.
9551089	Role of arginine 86 of the insulin receptor in insulin binding and activation of glucose transport.	Mutations in the insulin receptor gene cause the inherited insulin resistant syndrome leprechaunism. Patient Atl-1 with leprechaunism was homozygous for the substitution of Arg-86 with Pro (R86P) in the alpha subunit of the insulin receptor. Fibroblasts homozygous for the mutant receptor had defective insulin binding, but increased glucose transport and receptor kinase activity. The R86P mutation is located in a putative beta turn N-terminal to a proposed insulin binding domain of the receptor [P. DeMeyts, J.L. Gu, R.M. Shymko, B.E. Kaplan, G.I. Bell, J. Whittaker, Mol. Endocrinol. 4 (1990) 409-416]. To get further insight into the mechanism of the paradoxical activation of receptor signalling by the R86P mutation, the codons for proline, alanine, and glycine were substituted in the R86 position of the insulin receptor cDNA by PCR-mediated mutagenesis and stably transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Insulin binding increased 10-20 fold in CHO cells transfected with the wild type, the R86A, and the R86G insulin receptor cDNA, but did not increase in cells expressing the R86P mutation. The R86P mutation caused a constitutive activation of insulin receptor phosphorylation in CHO cells, but did not increase basal glucose transport or its sensitivity to insulin stimulation. By contrast, transfection with the wild type and the R86A receptors increased 20-30 fold the sensitivity of glucose transport to stimulation by insulin. The R86G insulin receptor bound insulin normally, but was four times less efficient than the wild type or R86A insulin receptor in increasing the sensitivity for insulin stimulation of glucose transport. These results indicate that position 86 of the insulin receptor alpha subunit is tolerant to substitution by alanine, but not by proline. Substitution with glycine allows insulin binding, but does not activate normally glucose transport, further supporting an essential role of this position in the initiation of insulin receptor signalling of glucose transport.
11402923	[Polymorphism of pro12Ala in peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma 2 (PPAgamma2): beta cell function and insulin sensitivity].	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor isoform gamma (PPAR gamma) is a key regulator in lipid and glucose homoeostasis. A common polymorphism (Pro12Ala in PPAR gamma 2, prevalence ca. 25%) was shown to be associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes. Generally, both beta-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the mechanism by which the Ala allele of this polymorphism contributes to the reduced risk for type 2 diabetes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 51 subjects without (Pro/Pro) and 26 subjects with this polymorphisms (X/Ala) (both groups non-diabetic) by a modified hyperglycaemic clamp which permitted determination of both insulin secretion (in response to glucose, GLP-1 and arginine) and insulin sensitivity. RESULTS: None of the various phases of insulin secretion was significantly different between the 2 genotype groups (all p values > 0.13). In contrast, insulin sensitivity was significantly greater in X/Ala (0.19 +/- 0.03 U) compared to Pro/Pro (0.14 +/- 0.01 U, p = 0.04). In a two-dimensional assessment of insulin sensitivity and secretion, the homozygous alanine carriers appeared to have the most favourable constellation. CONCLUSION: These simultaneously obtained data for insulin secretion and sensitivity strongly suggest that the mechanism by which the Ala allele contributes to a risk reduction for type 2 diabetes most likely involves an increase in insulin sensitivity.
1341275	Amiloride inhibits the growth of human colon cancer cells in vitro.	Cytoplasmic alkalinization induced by activation of the Na+/H+ antiport plays an essential role in the initiation of cell proliferation. In the present study we examined the effects of amiloride, a specific and reversible inhibitor of Na+/H+ antiporter, on the growth of human colon cancer cells (HT-29). Amiloride (50-800 microM) inhibited the growth of HT-29 cells in a dose-dependent fashion. Forty-three percent inhibition of growth was found at an amiloride concentration of 400 microM after 4 days of treatment. The inhibitory effect of amiloride on growth of HT-29 cells was reversible since removal of amiloride by a media change after 48 h treatment lead to rapid regrowth to control levels. The reversibility of growth inhibition suggests that amiloride is not a non-specific cytotoxin for HT-29 cells. We examined the possible mechanisms for the inhibitory effects of amiloride. Amiloride (400 microM) completely abolished serum-stimulated ODC activity and inhibited difluoromethylornithine (DMFO)-stimulated putrescine uptake by 56%. We conclude that amiloride inhibits the in vitro growth of human colon cancer cells; since ODC-activity and polyamine transport were both inhibited, the inhibitory effects may be mediated in part by polyamine-dependent processes. Amiloride may be a useful agent in the treatment of colon cancer.
7962604	Expression of c-erbB-2, c-myc, and c-ras oncoproteins, insulin-like growth factor receptor I, and epidermal growth factor receptor in ovarian carcinoma.	AIMS: To assess whether the overexpression of five dominant oncogene encoded proteins is crucial to the pathogenesis of ovarian carcinoma and whether this provides any useful prognostic information. METHODS: The expression of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (ILGFR 1), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and the c-erbB-2, c-ras, and c-myc products was studied by multiparameter flow cytometry in 80 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer for whom long term follow up was available. RESULTS: Overexpression of ILGFR 1, EGFR, c-erbB-2, c-ras and c-myc was found in, respectively, nine of 80 (11%), 10 of 80 (12%), 19 of 80 (24%), 16 of 80 (20%) and 28 of 80 (35%) ovarian carcinomas. The levels of expression of ILGFR 1, EGFR, c-erbB-2 and c-ras were significantly higher in the tumours of patients with recurrent or persistent disease after chemotherapy than in the tumours of patients at initial presentation (p < 0.02). Multivariate analysis showed that residual tumour (p < 0.001), FIGO stage (p = 0.002), EGFR overexpression (p = 0.030) and previous chemotherapy (p = 0.034) were independent variables for predicting survival. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of these oncoproteins only occurs in a small proportion of ovarian carcinomas but may have an important role in the progression of the disease.
10649273	c-erbB-2 protein overexpression and p53 immunoreaction in primary and recurrent breast cancer tissues.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether expression levels of c-erbB-2 and p53 proteins in breast cancer tissues differ in primary and metastatic lesions. METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining or sandwich enzyme immunoassay was used to determine expression levels of c-erbB-2 and p53 proteins in 42 breast cancer samples from 21 patients. Estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors (PgR) were also measured by enzyme immunoassay in each case. All patients had undergone radical surgery for primary tumors and surgical resection of asynchronous metastatic lesions. Thirteen patients (62%) were premenopausal and 14 (67%) received postoperative adjuvant therapies. Median disease-free survival time was 26 months (range, 5-104). The resected metastatic lesions included 1 in the liver, 3 in the lung, and 3 in the supraclavicular lymph nodes. The remaining 14 were local skin lesions. RESULTS: There was no difference in the positivity rate of c-erbB-2 (38%: 8/21) and p53 (39%: 7/18) expression between the primary tumors and the recurrent lesions. In addition, no discordant c-erbB-2 or p53 expression was observed between the primary tumors and their respective metastatic lesions. Positivity rates for ER and PgR were 50% (10/20) and 60% (12/20) for the primary tumors, but only 25% (5/20) and 30% (6/20) for the recurrent lesions, respectively (P = 0. 19 for ER and P = 0.11 for PgR). CONCLUSIONS: c-erbB-2 and p53 expression levels in breast cancer cells were almost unchanged as the disease progressed and/or in response to adjuvant therapies, regardless of the hormone receptor status.
8530839	[Cardiac operation of the cases associated with malignant tumor].	Twelve cases of malignant tumor (mean age 64 years) underwent the cardiac operation. The procedure of cardiac operations were 10 coronary artery bypass grafting and 2 mitral valve replacement. The detail of malignant tumors were 4 gastric cancer, 3 colon cancer, 3 lung cancer, 1 esophageal cancer and 1 lip cancer. The cardiac operations followed the operations of malignant tumor in 4 cases and the cardiac operations were followed by the operations of malignant tumor in 7 cases. The former cases did not recur the tumor from 10 to 30 months follow up period. The all latter cases survived except 1 case from 1 month to 21 months. Our management for the cases associated with malignant tumor and cardiac diseases as next. We perform the cardiac operation for the case whose life expectancy is longer than 1 year. We perform the cardiac operation before the operation of malignant tumor. We perform the operation for malignant tumor as soon as the patient had recovered from the cardiac operation. We would not perform any adjuvant therapy before completion of the operation for the heart and tumor.
12446969	Amyloid beta antagonizes insulin promoted secretion of the amyloid beta protein precursor.	Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides are direct competitive inhibitors of insulin binding and action [25]. We demonstrate that Abeta peptides can inhibit the effect of insulin on the metabolic processing of the amyloid beta protein precursor (AbetaPP). As evidence emerges concerning the role of insulin and insulin like growth factors (IGFs) in learning and memory, recent findings have suggested that insulin may have a significant role in the pathogenetic pathways leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD). As an example several investigators have demonstrated upregulation of insulin receptors and defective insulin receptor signal transduction in AD brains. Moreover insulin has been shown to positively modulate AbetaPP proteolytic processing. The fact that insulin and Abeta appear to share a common system for degradation and disposal as they are both substrates of the insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) suggested the possibility of a reciprocal interference. Here we report that Abeta can directly interfere with insulin receptor signalling inhibiting the autophosphorylation of partially purified insulin receptors. As a consequence of such interaction we also demonstrate that Abeta blocks the effect of insulin on the release of sAbetaPPalpha in chinese hamster ovaries (CHO) cells transfected with insulin receptors.
9852124	Insulin receptor substrate 2 and Shc play different roles in insulin-like growth factor I signaling.	The major substrates for the type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) receptor are Shc and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. In the current study, we report that IGF-I induces a sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with Grb2 in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. The time course of Shc tyrosine phosphorylation parallels the time course of IGF-I-stimulated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Transfection of SH-SY5Y cells with a p52 Shc mutant decreases Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Shc-Grb2 association. This results in the inhibition of IGF-I-mediated ERK tyrosine phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth. In contrast, IGF-I induces a transient tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 and an association of IRS-2 with Grb2. The time course of IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and IRS-2-Grb2 and IRS-2-p85 association closely resembles the time course of IGF-I-mediated membrane ruffling. Treating cells with the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 blocks IGF-I-induced membrane ruffling. The ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059, as well as transfection with the p52 Shc mutant, has no effect on IGF-I-mediated membrane ruffling. Immunolocalization studies show IRS-2 and Grb2, but not Shc, concentrated at the tip of the extending growth cone where membrane ruffling is most active. Collectively, these results suggest that the association of Shc with Grb2 is essential for IGF-I-mediated neurite outgrowth, whereas the IRS-2-Grb2-phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase complex may regulate growth cone extension and membrane ruffling.
10399915	Autonomous control of cell and organ size by CHICO, a Drosophila homolog of vertebrate IRS1-4.	The control of growth is fundamental to the developing metazoan. Here, we show that CHICO, a Drosophila homolog of vertebrate IRS1-4, plays an essential role in the control of cell size and growth. Animals mutant for chico are less than half the size of wild-type flies, owing to fewer and smaller cells. In mosaic animals, chico homozygous cells grow slower than their heterozygous siblings, show an autonomous reduction in cell size, and form organs of reduced size. Although chico flies are smaller, they show an almost 2-fold increase in lipid levels. The similarities of the growth defects caused by mutations in chico and the insulin receptor gene in Drosophila and by perturbations of the insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway in vertebrates suggest that this pathway plays a conserved role in the regulation of overall growth by controling cell size, cell number, and metabolism.
11163495	Loss of heterozygosity at the mannose 6-phosphate insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (M6P/IGF2R) locus predisposes patients to radiation-induced lung injury.	PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (M6P/IGF2R) gene locus and the development of radiation-induced lung injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-five lung cancer patients with both stored plasma for Transforming Growth Factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) analysis and sufficient quantities of archival pathology tissue to screen for LOH were studied. All patients had been treated with thoracic radiotherapy for their malignancy and had radiographically detectable tumor present before beginning radiotherapy. Tumor and normal cells were microdissected from archival lung cancer pathology specimens. Two polymorphisms in the 3' untranslated region of the M6P/IGF2R were used to screen for LOH. Plasma TGFbeta1 levels were measured using acid-ethanol extraction and an ELISA. TGFbeta1 and M6P/IGF2R protein expression was estimated by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining. Symptomatic radiation pneumonitis was scored according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria without knowledge of the results of TGFbeta or LOH analyses. RESULTS: Of the 35 patients, 10 were homozygous for this polymorphism (noninformative) and were excluded. Of the 25 informative patients, 13 had LOH. Twelve of 13 patients with LOH had increased pretreatment plasma TGFbeta1 levels, vs. 3/12 patients without LOH (p < 0.01). A decrease or loss of M6P/IGF2R protein in the malignant cell accompanied by increased latent TGFbeta1 protein in extracellular matrix and tumor stroma was found in tumors with LOH, suggesting that this mutation resulted in loss of function of the receptor. Seven of 13 (54%) LOH patients developed symptomatic radiation-induced lung injury vs. 1/12 (8%) of patients without LOH (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Loss of the M6P/IGF2R gene strongly correlates with the development of radiation pneumonitis after thoracic radiotherapy (RT). Furthermore, patients with LOH (in the setting of measurable tumor) are much more likely to have elevated plasma TGFbeta, suggesting an inability to normally process this cytokine. Thus, loss of the M6P/IGF2R gene may predispose patients to the development of radiation-induced lung injury.
12671184	Insulin resistance and its contribution to colon carcinogenesis.	The insulin resistance-colon cancer hypothesis, stating that insulin resistance may be associated with the development of colorectal cancer, represents a significant advance in colon cancer, as it emphasizes the potential for this cancer to become a modifiable disease. The fact that the incidence of insulin resistance has been increasing in the United States and much of the rest of the Western world where colon cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death makes the exploration of the interrelationship of these conditions a subject of high priority. Here, we review the salient features of insulin resistance, defined as impaired biological response to the action of insulin. Recent epidemiological studies, evaluating potential associations between colon cancer risk and diabetes mellitus, dietary intake and metabolic factors, and IGF levels in several clinical settings, provide strong support of the insulin resistance-colon cancer hypothesis (without establishing causality). Mechanistically, insulin resistance has been associated with hyperinsulinemia, increased levels of growth factors including IGF-1, and alterations in NF-kappaB and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling, which may promote colon cancer through their effects on colonocyte kinetics. It is a reasonable expectation that in the not too distant future, critical interventions to the already mapped molecular sequence of events, which link two apparently disparate entities, combined with lifestyle changes could abrogate the development of colon cancer.
7654383	Expression of tumor necrosis factor receptors in human lung cancer cells and normal lung tissues.	The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors for the control of the biologic action of TNF-alpha in lung cancer cells and normal lung tissues. Lung cancer specimens and normal lung tissues were freshly obtained in pairs from 15 patients who underwent surgery for lung cancer. Thirteen lung cancer specimens expressed the 55 kDa TNF receptor messenger RNA (mRNA), whereas only six lung cancer specimens expressed the 75 kDa TNF receptor mRNA by Northern blot analysis. The 55 kDa and 75 kDa TNF receptors mRNA were detected in all and 11 normal lung tissues, respectively. All four lung carcinoma cell lines examined expressed the 55 kDa TNF receptor mRNA, but only RERF-LC-MS (MS) expressed both the 55 kDa and 75 kDa TNF receptors mRNA. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that lung cancer cells expressed the 55 kDa TNF receptor, but not the 75 kDa TNF receptor at the protein level. In normal lung tissues, the 55 kDa TNF receptor was detected in alveolar macrophages, bronchioles, and some small vessels. The 75 kDa TNF receptor was detected in alveolar macrophages. All four lung carcinoma cell lines examined exhibited the only 55 kDa TNF receptor. TNF-mediated tumor cell lysis was observed in all lung carcinoma cell lines that exhibited the 55 kDa TNF receptor except A549, which is a TNF-insensitive cell line. In surface binding assays, specific surface binding of TNF-alpha to TNF-insensitive cell line A549 was observed to be about half that of TNF-sensitive cell lines.

9234922	Infrared spectroscopy of normal and abnormal cervical smears: evaluation by principal component analysis.	"Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of malignant and dysplastic cervical scrapings were abnormal, as first described in our study of a limited number of samples, where the spectra were evaluated by visual inspection and peak intensity ratios. We have expanded our study to evaluate more cervical conditions, and to analyze the spectra by a chemometric approach (principal component analysis [PCA]). Cervical samples from 436 females were evaluated by FT-IR and Papanicolaou testing; 40/436 spectra were nonanalyzable. The remaining were as follows: normal, 174; malignant, 19; dysplasia, 8; atypia, 113; atrophy, 19; inflammatory, 47; bloody smear, 12; hypocellular, 4. PCA analysis followed by chi2 test revealed that statistically significant frequencies of being predicted malignant by FT-IR were associated with samples diagnosed as malignant (P < 0.0001), and also those diagnosed as ""atrophy"" (P < 0.001), ""atypical with bloody smear"" (P < 0.05), ""atypical with atrophic pattern"" (P < 0.05), and ""dysplasia"" (P < 0.05). Based on these findings, for the diagnosis of cervical cancer by FT-IR, as defined here, the sensitivity is 79%, the specificity is 77%, the positive predictive value is 15%, and the negative predictive value is 98.6%. Our findings (a) demonstrate the application of a chemometric approach to the study of cervical FT-IR spectra; (b) assess its potential diagnostic role; (c) suggest that atrophic and neoplastic samples share structural features; and (d) suggest that blood may interfere with such spectroscopic evaluation. These findings warrant further evaluation of FT- IR spectroscopy in cervical and other malignancies."
9777289	Familial defective apolipoprotein B-100.	Abnormal interaction between low density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) and their ligands, apolipoprotein E and B, causes decreased catabolism of lipoproteins which carry these apolipoproteins (VLDL, IDL and/or LDL) and thereby increased plasma concentrations of these. In familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), abnormal interaction is due to mutations in the LDLR gene, and in type III hyperlipidemia due to mutations in the apo E gene. A few mutations in the apolipoprotein B (apo B) gene have been described, of which the apo B-3,500Arg-Gln seems by far the most frequent, that causes defective binding to normal LDLR. The metabolic disorder associated with these mutations has been named familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 (FDB). The frequency of the apo B-3,500Arg-Gln mutation is particularly high in Central Europe (Switzerland) with lower frequencies south of the Alpes, in Russia and in Scandinavia. We found an incidence of 1/1250 of the mutation in Denmark (III), employing a DNA based assay optimized to allow detection of the mutation in very small amounts of DNA (I). Since other mutations in the receptor binding domain of the apo B-100 have been described, we developed another DNA based assay, employing DGGE technique, to screen for other mutations in the region of amino acid 3,456 to 3,553 (II). However, no other mutations but the apo B-3,500Arg-Gln have so far been detected in Danish hypercholesterolemic patients. In a study of 5 Danish families with FDB (46 heterozygous FDB patients and 57 unaffected relatives) we found that FDB patients had significantly increased mean cholesterol and LDL cholesterol concentrations, but with a wide range of variation and with approximately 30% having cholesterol concentrations below the 95th percentile for the general population (IV). This was confirmed in a compilation of data on 205 FDB patients from the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark (V). In this study we also compared the biochemical and clinical features of FDB with those of 101 Danish FH patients in whome FDB had been ruled out. Our data support, that the LDL cholesterol elevation is less pronounced in FDB than in FH and that the age-specific prevalence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is lower in FDB than in FH. In the compiled study of 205 FDB heterozygotes (V), we found that age, gender and genetic variation in the LDLR gene explained a considerable part of the between-individual variation in total and LDL cholesterol. We conducted a prospective study of the lipid lowering effect of pravastatin and gemfibrozil in 30 Danish FDB patients (VI). Together with other, retrospective, studies, we conclude that the cholesterol lowering effect of HMG-coA-reductase inhibitors, anion binding resins and nicotinic acid is fully comparable to that observed when treating FH patients and type IIa hypercholesterolemic patients, without clinical signs of FH.
11260230	Identification of novel C253Y missense and Y864X nonsense mutations in the insulin receptor gene in type A insulin-resistant patients.	Mutations in the insulin receptor gene have been reported in cases of type A insulin resistance. We report herein two cases of type A insulin resistance, which involve some novel mutations. Case 1 is a heterozygote of the C253Y missense mutation and case 2 is a heterozygote of the Y864X nonsense mutation. In the C253Y missense mutation in exon 3, a cysteine residue is replaced with tyrosine in the cysteine-rich domain of the alpha subunit. The Y864X in exon 13 results in a truncated receptor, which is devoid of most of the beta subunit. This mutant receptor could not be expressed on a cell membrane since the transmembrane domain is missing. Other significant mutations were not found for the entire coding regions and splice/donor sites.
8633403	Determining prognosis of clinically localized prostate cancer by immunohistochemical detection of mutant p53.	OBJECTIVES: Mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene can result in unregulated cellular growth and have been implicated in numerous malignancies. The objective of this study was to determine whether the detection of mutant p53 by immunohistochemical staining is predictive of progression in clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate. METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining for mutant p53 was performed on 40 formalin-fixed radical prostatectomy specimens. Benign glands in the sections served as controls. Immunoreactivity (IR) was categorized semi-quantitatively from 0 to 4+ (0 = no IR, 1+ = 1 % to 10%, 2+ = 11% to 40%, 3+ = 41 % to 70%, 4+ = 71 % to 100%). Results were then compared to Gleason score, Stage (T2 versus T3), surgical margins, lymph node and seminal vesicle involvement, age, race, preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and biochemical progression. Biochemical progression was defined as a persistently elevated postoperative PSA of 0.2 ng/mL or greater. RESULTS: Thirty-two of the 40 tumors (80%) stained for mutant p53. None of the tumors that did not stain progressed, whereas 20 of 32 (62.5%) of the tumors that did stain progressed, with an overall mean followup of 50.8 months. Immunoreactivity did not correlate with any of the known prognostic variables but did have statistically significant correlation with progression by all three statistical methods used (Fisher's exact test, logistic regression, and log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: Strict quality control and newer antigen retrieval techniques reveal p53 abnormalities in many prostate cancers. Immunohistochemical detection of mutant p53 appears to be an independent predictor of progression. These data suggest potential utility of p53 as a preoperative prognostic indicator in localized prostate cancer.
10319328	Enhancement of insulin-like growth factor signaling in human breast cancer: estrogen regulation of insulin receptor substrate-1 expression in vitro and in vivo.	Cross-talk between insulin-like growth factor (IGF)- and estrogen receptor (ER)-signaling pathways results in synergistic growth. We show here that estrogen enhances IGF signaling by inducing expression of three key IGF-regulatory molecules, the type 1 IGF receptor (IGFR1) and its downstream signaling molecules, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2. Estrogen induction of IGFR1 and IRS expression resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 after IGF-I stimulation, followed by enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. To examine whether these pathways were similarly activated in vivo, we examined MCF-7 cells grown as xenografts in athymic mice. IRS-1 was expressed at high levels in estrogen-dependent growth of MCF-7 xenografts, but withdrawal of estrogen, which decreased tumor growth, resulted in a dramatic decrease in IRS-1 expression. Finally, we have shown that high IRS-1 expression is an indicator of early disease recurrence in ER-positive human primary breast tumors. Taken together, these data not only reinforce the concept of cross-talk between IGF- and ER-signaling pathways, but indicate that IGF molecules may be critical regulators of estrogen-mediated growth and breast cancer pathogenesis.
10614641	Expression of a prenylation-deficient Rab4 interferes with propagation of insulin signaling through insulin receptor substrate-1.	Rab proteins are small GTP-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily that function in the regulation of vesicle transport processes. The Rab4 isoform has been implicated in insulin action. For instance, overexpression of a prenylation-deficient form of Rab4 has been shown to inhibit insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation. Other steps affected by Rab4 in the cascade of events resulting from insulin receptor activation have not been elucidated. In the present studies, we measured effects on insulin-signaling proteins in 3T3-L1 adipocytes transiently expressing cytoplasmic forms of Rab4 and Rab5. Expression of a mutant Rab4 lacking a prenylation site resulted in reduced insulin-dependent phosphorylation ofcytoplasmic and internal membrane-associated insulin receptor substrate-1, leading to decreased insulin receptor substrate-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3'-OH kinase activation and decreased Akt activation. These effects were not observed upon introduction of a similar mutant form of Rab5. These data indicate that Rab4 or a Rab4-associated protein is involved at one or more steps in propagating the insulin signal, in addition to any role it may play in the regulation of GLUT4 vesicle translocation. Our results support models of insulin signaling in which regulation of internal membrane trafficking plays a role in transduction of the insulin signal.
11125119	OrCGDB: a database of genes involved in oral cancer.	The Oral Cancer Gene Database (OrCGDB; http://www.tumor-gene. org/Oral/oral.html) was developed to provide the biomedical community with easy access to the latest information on the genes involved in oral cancer. The information is stored in a relational database and accessed through a WWW interface. The OrCGDB is organized by gene name, which is linked to information describing properties of the gene. This information is stored as a collection of findings ('facts') that are entered by the database curator in a semi-structured format from information in primary publications using a WWW interface. These facts include causes of oncogenic activation, chromosomal localization of the gene, mutations associated with the gene, the biochemical identity and activity of the gene product, synonyms for the gene name and a variety of clinical information. Each fact is associated with a MEDLINE citation. The user can search the OrCGDB by gene name or by entering a textword. The OrCGDB is part of a larger WWW-based tumor gene database and represents a new approach to catalog and display the research literature.
12002902	Screening for mutations in exons encoding the ligand-binding domain of the LDL receptor gene using PCR-CFLP and PCR-SSCP.	Primary hypercholesterolemia includes both monogenic disorders and polygenic conditions. Two well defined monogenic disorders are familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and familial defective apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 (FDB). Both disorders convey high risk of premature coronary artery disease. FH and FDB are caused by mutations in LDL receptor and apo B-100 genes, respectively. In the present study, mutations in both genes in Thai subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia were screened. For apo B-100 gene, a common mutation R3500Q was screened. This mutation was not observed in the patients (n = 45). For LDL receptor gene, mutations in the exons encoding the ligand-binding domain were screened. By PCR-CFLP analysis, 18 abnormal CFLP patterns in exon 4, the hot spot for mutations, were found in patients (n=45). One of the DNA samples with abnormal CFLP patterns was previously identified and reported as a possible disease-causing mutation, namely D151Y. For the other exons, the screening technique was PCR-SSCP. Abnormal SSCP patterns in DNA samples from patients (n=20) were found as follows, two in exon 3, one in exon 5 and another one in exon 6. Further characterization by DNA sequencing and family studies for these abnormal patterns are underway.
10844119	Characterization of pancreastatin receptor and signaling in rat HTC hepatoma cells.	Pancreastatin, a chromogranin A-derived peptide widely distributed throughout the neuroendocrine system, has a general inhibitory effect on endocrine secretion and a counterregulatory effect on insulin action. We have recently described the cross-talk of pancreastatin with insulin signaling in rat hepatoma cells (HTC), where it inhibits insulin action and signaling through the serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, thereby impairing tyrosine kinase activity. Here, we have characterized pancreastatin receptors and signaling in HTC cells. The pancreastatin effector systems were studied by determining phospholipase C activity in HTC membranes and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation activity in HTC cells. Binding studies with radiolabeled pancreastatin showed a population of high affinity binding sites, with a B(max) of 8 fmol/mg protein and a K(d) of 0.6 nM. Moreover, we assessed the coupling of the receptor with a G protein system by inhibiting the binding with guanine nucleotide and by measuring the GTP binding to HTC membranes. We found that pancreastatin receptor was coupled with a G alpha(q/11) protein which activates phospholipase C-beta(1) and phospholipase C-beta(3), in addition to MAPK via both beta gamma and alpha(q/11).
11443207	Hypoglycemia and resistance to ketoacidosis in a subject without functional insulin receptors.	Humans with congenital absence of the islets of Langerhans and mice rendered null for the insulin receptor rapidly develop severe hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis and, if untreated, die in the early neonatal period. In contrast, children with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations of the insulin receptor gene, although hyperglycemic postprandially, survive for many months without developing ketoacidosis. Paradoxically, they often develop hypoglycemia. The rarity of the condition and the difficulties of undertaking metabolic studies in ill infants have limited the physiological information that might explain the clinical features. We studied a boy with Donohue's syndrome who represents a further example of the null phenotype, with two different and novel nonsense mutations in the alpha-subunit of the receptor. He survived for 8 months without developing ketoacidosis, and fasting hypoglycemia was a frequent problem. Despite the complete absence of insulin receptors, evidence for persistent insulin-like effects on fat and liver was seen; fasting plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and nonesterified fatty acid levels were low, fell further during the early postprandial period, and failed to rise in response to hypoglycemia. The inverse relationships between plasma insulin and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 levels were maintained, suggesting persistent hepatic effects of insulin. GH levels measured over a 6.5-h period were low throughout. Thus, the differences between congenital insulin deficiency vs. insulin receptor deficiency in humans may be explained by persistent insulinomimetic activity of the grossly elevated plasma insulin presumably being mediated through the type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor. As GH plays a critical role in the regulation of ketogenesis during insulinopenia in humans, but not in rodents, this may contribute to the distinct phenotype of human vs. mouse insulin receptor knockouts.
12150454	Insulin-like growth factor binding proteins 1 and 3 and breast cancer outcomes.	The IGF family of growth factors is believed to play a role in the development and progression of breast cancer. We recently identified an adverse prognostic effect of insulin in breast cancer; we now report prognostic effects of circulating IGFBP's 1 and 3. 512 women with T1-3, N0-1, M0 breast cancer provided fasting blood which was analysed for IGFBP's I and 3. Information on body size, diet and traditional prognostic factors and treatment was obtained; women were followed for recurrence and death. IGFBP-1 levels correlated inversely with insulin levels (Spearman r = -0.60, p < 0.0001), reflecting known inhibition of IGFBP-1 gene expression by insulin. Insulin explained 36% of the variance in IGFBP-1 levels. IGFBP-1 levels were also correlated with obesity and diet. Levels of IGFBP-1 significantly predicted distant recurrence and death, hazard ratio (95% CI) for lower versus upper quartile 2.08 (1.20-3.61) and 3.0 (1.45-6.21), respectively. These effects persisted after adjustment for tumor-related variables and treatment but were not independent of insulin levels. High levels of IGFBP-3 predicted distant recurrence (hazard ratio upper v.s. lower quartile 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0) but not death (hazard ratio 1.0, 95% CI 0.5-1.9). The effect on distant recurrence was restricted to postmenopausal women (hazard ratio 3.8, 95% CI 1.6-9.0) and to those with estrogen receptor positive tumors (p = 0.002). Prognostic effects of IGFBP-1 appear related to the known effect of insulin on IGFBP-1 gene expression. The adverse effect of IGFBP-3 on distant recurrence in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer should be further investigated.
12907608	Reduced circulating insulin-like growth factor I levels delay the onset of chemically and genetically induced mammary tumors.	Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) play a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. The aim of this study was to examine the potential relationship between serum IGF-I levels and breast cancer risk. To do this, we studied liver-specific IGF-I gene-deleted (LID) mice, in which circulating IGF-I levels are 25% of that in control mice. Mammary tumors were induced in two ways: (a) by exposing mice to the carcinogen 7,12-dimethybenz (a)anthracene; and (b) by crossing LID mice with C3(1)/SV40 large T-antigen transgenic mice. In both models, LID mice exhibited a delayed latency period of mammary tumor development. In the 7,12-dimethybenz (a)anthracene-induced mammary tumor model, the incidence of palpable mammary tumors was significantly lower in LID mice (26% versus 56% in controls), and the onset of the tumors was delayed (74 +/- 1.2 days in LID mice versus 59.5 +/- 1.1 days in controls). Histological analysis showed extensive squamous metaplasia in late-stage mammary tumors of control mice, whereas late-stage tumors from LID mice exhibited extensive hyperplasia, but little metaplasia. In control mice, the onset of C3(1)/SV40-large T-antigen-induced mammary tumors occurred at 21.6 +/- 1.8 weeks of age, whereas in LID mice the average age of onset was 30.2 +/- 1.7 weeks. In addition, 60% of the mice in the control group developed two or more mammary tumors per mouse, whereas in the LID mice only 30% developed more than one mammary tumor per mouse. Our data demonstrate that circulating IGF-I levels play a significant role as a risk factor in the onset and development of mammary tumors in two well-established animal models of breast cancer.
10551398	Increased activity and expression of MAP kinase in HCC model rats induced by 3'-methyl-4-dimethylamino-azobenzene.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade plays an important role not only in the mitogenic signal transduction pathway but also in the development of cancer, and it is believed to be one of the important regulators in normal hepatocytes and hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this study was to determine the role of insulin receptor substrate-1 and the MAPK cascade in rats with hepatocellular carcinoma induced by 3'-methyl-4-dimethylamino-azobenzene (3'-MeDAB). METHODS: Liver cancer was induced in rats by feeding 3'-MeDAB, and the changes in expression of IRS-1 and MAPK were analyzed in tumorous, non-tumorous and control liver. RESULTS: Expression of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) showed a 1.4-fold increase at protein level in the tumors (p<0.01), but the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 did not differ between the tumor and control liver. Expression of MAPK and its activity were elevated 4.5-7.5-fold (p<0.01) and 4.6-fold (p<0.01) in the tumor compared with control liver. In non-tumorous lesions from rats fed with 3'-MeDAB, expression of MAPK, but not IRS-1, increased significantly (p<0.01). Between tumorous and adjacent non-tumorous lesions, there was a significant difference in MAPK expression (p<0.05) and activities (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The increased expression of MAPK may play an important role in the progression or initiation of HCC in this rat model.
7962321	Deletion of 3 basepairs resulting in the loss of lysine-121 in the insulin receptor alpha-subunit in a patient with leprechaunism: binding, phosphorylation, and biological activity.	We have identified a novel mutation of the human insulin receptor gene in a previously unreported patient with leprechaunism, leprechaun Rochester. This mutation consists of deletion of three nucleotides (GAA) in exon 2 and results in loss of the lysine-121 in the putative ligand-binding domain of the alpha-subunit. To analyze this mutation, we prepared a corresponding mutant insulin receptor by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed the receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Although the mutant receptor displayed normal insulin binding, abnormalities were found in autophosphorylation and in phosphorylation of endogenous and exogenous protein substrates. These abnormalities consisted of increased basal kinase activity, but blunted insulin-stimulated responsiveness. Importantly, cells that expressed the mutant receptor showed markedly decreased insulin- and serum-stimulated DNA synthesis compared to untransfected control cells and cells transfected with the wild-type insulin receptor. These findings suggest that deletion of lysine-121 in conjunction with a presumed, but thus far unidentified, second mutant allele contributed significantly to the lethal insulin-resistant state in this patient with leprechaunism.
10081189	[Direct detection of mutations in the LDL receptor gene in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia].	BACKGROUND: Familial hypercholesterolemia is one of the most frequent hereditary metabolic diseases. As a result of the functional disorder of the molecule of the LDL receptor LDL cholesterol is not sufficiently eliminated from the blood stream and exerts an atherogenic effect. The objective of the study was to introduce direct detection of mutations in the gene for the LDL receptor and characterize the spectrum of mutations in the Czech population. METHODS AND RESULTS: The authors analyzed a group of 84 unrelated patients where on the basis of clinical and biochemical criteria the diagnosis of FH was established. From the group 12 patients were eliminated (14.3%) where a mutation 3500 in the gene for apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 was detected. This mutation is most frequently the cause of a familial defect of apo B-100 (FDB), which cannot be differentiated clinically or biochemically from FH. In the LDL receptor gene a total of 11 mutations were found in 14 unrelated patients (16.7%), incl. 7 mutations not described hitherto. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first systematic characteristic of the spectrum of mutations in the LDL receptor gene in the Czech population. Molecular genetic analysis of the gene for the LDL receptor in affected families can contribute towards early assessment of the diagnosis of FH and thus to prevention of life threatening cardiovascular episodes in asymptomatic subjects.
12615714	Evidence of selection for clones having genetic inactivation of the activin A type II receptor (ACVR2) gene in gastrointestinal cancers.	The activin signaling pathway parallels the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta pathway. Both use extracellular ligands and cell surface receptors that are structurally and functionally related, as well as the same intracellular mediators (SMADs 2-4) to transmit these signals. Members of both pathways have been characterized previously as tumor suppressor genes on the demonstration of inactivating mutations in human neoplasms, e.g., genetic inactivation of the activin type I receptor was reported recently in pancreatic cancer. Here, we present evidence of selection for mutations of the activin A type II receptor (ACVR2) gene during human gastrointestinal carcinogenesis. Two 8-bp polyadenine tracts of the ACVR2 gene are targets for inactivating frameshift mutations in gastrointestinal neoplasms having microsatellite instability (MSI). These mutations are similar to those of the 10-bp polyadenine tract within the TGF-beta type II receptor (TGFBR2), a well-characterized target of frameshift mutations in the same neoplasms. We identified biallelic mutations of ACVR2 in 25 of 28 MSI colorectal and pancreatic cancers. In addition, a mutation in the ACVR2 gene combined with loss of the wild-type allele was found in a non-MSI pancreatic cancer. This evidence is compatible with a high degree of selection for inactivation of the ACVR2 gene in tumorigenesis, supporting ACVR2 as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in gastrointestinal cancers.
7815442	Homozygosity for a new mutation (Ile119-->Met) in the insulin receptor gene in five sibs with familial insulin resistance.	Mutations in the insulin receptor gene can cause genetic syndromes such as leprechaunism that are associated with extreme insulin resistance. We have investigated a patient with leprechaunism born of a consanguineous marriage. All 22 exons of the insulin receptor gene were screened for mutations using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Thereafter, the nucleotide sequences of selected exons were determined directly. The patient was homozygous for a point mutation in exon 2 of the insulin receptor gene which results in the substitution of methionine for isoleucine at codon 119. Thus, the mutant allele encodes a receptor that has a mutation in the putative insulin binding domain. Accordingly, the mutant receptor would be predicted not to transduce the insulin signal effectively. In spite of a homozygous abnormality of the insulin receptor gene and many of the clinical features of severe insulin resistance, the proband's clinical syndrome was noticeably different from previously described patients with leprechaunism who usually die within the first six months of life. There are a total of nine children in the family, five of whom are homozygous for the Ile119-->Met mutation in the insulin receptor gene, and are clinically affected with varying degrees of severity. Four unaffected sibs are clinically normal; two are heterozygous carriers of the mutant allele, one is homozygous for the normal allele, and one unaffected sib was not available for molecular studies.
8297340	Association of the insulin receptor and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase requires a third component.	We have studied the interactions between the insulin receptor and PtdIns 3-kinase by a reconstitution system in vitro composed of highly purified PtdIns 3-kinase from rat liver and highly purified insulin receptors bound to insulin-agarose or to antibodies against insulin receptors. As a positive control, receptors for platelet-derived growth factor, which bind and phosphorylate PtdIns 3-kinase, were studied in parallel with insulin receptors. Our results indicate that the insulin receptor, regardless of its phosphorylation state, does not directly associate with purified PtdIns 3-kinase, whereas the autophosphorylated receptor does associate with PtdIns 3-kinase present in the crude CHO-cell lysate. Also, we could not detect phosphorylation of PtdIns 3-kinase by the insulin receptor, even through the receptor readily underwent autophosphorylation and phosphorylated an insulin-receptor substrate, poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1). These findings argue that one or more cytosolic components link the receptor and the enzyme. Insulin-receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) was evaluated as a potential linking protein. In the absence of ATP, IRS-1 did not facilitate the coupling of the phosphorylated insulin receptor to PtdIns 3-kinase. Thus IRS-1 is unlikely to be the component in crude CHO-cell lysate that couples PtdIns 3-kinase to the phosphorylated insulin receptor. However, the addition of ATP, which allows phosphorylation of IRS-1 by the insulin receptor, also enhances the coupling of PtdIns 3-kinase to the insulin receptor. In support of this idea, immunoprecipitates of IRS-1 from insulin-treated CHO cells were found to contain both the insulin receptor and PtdIns 3-kinase. In conclusion, the insulin receptor does not appear to phosphorylate or bind directly to PtdIns 3-kinase, regardless of the receptor's state of phosphorylation. Association of PtdIns 3-kinase with the insulin receptor is mediated by one or more components, one of which may involve an unidentified factor in cell lysate and another that apparently involves phosphorylated IRS-1.
8690160	Insulin sensitivity and body weight changes in young white carriers of the codon 64 amino acid polymorphism of the beta 3-adrenergic receptor gene.	Recently, a missense mutation replacing tryptophan with arginine at codon 64 of the beta 3-adrenergic receptor gene was shown to be associated with insulin resistance in nondiabetic subjects and to an earlier onset of NIDDM in Pima Indians. We studied whether the codon 64 amino acid polymorphism of the beta 3-adrenergic receptor gene in a cohort of young healthy Danes was associated with high birth weight, accelerated weight gain during childhood and adolescence, present obesity, or impaired insulin sensitivity. The protocol included 380 unrelated white subjects in whom insulin sensitivity and secretion were measured during a combined intravenous glucose and tolbutamide tolerance test. A number of biochemical and anthropometric characteristics were determined for each subject. The subjects were genotyped for the codon 64 polymorphism by applying polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment-length polymorphism screening with the use of endonuclease BstN1. The allelic frequency of the mutated allele was 7% (95% CI: 5-10%), and it was similar in obese and nonobese subjects. The beta 3-adrenergic receptor gene variant was not related to birth weight or weight gain during childhood or adolescence. In its heterozygous form, the gene variant was not associated with an altered insulin sensitivity index (SI) or other features of the insulin resistance syndrome (BMI, blood pressure, fasting serum lipid levels, or fasting serum fibrinolytic variables). Three homozygous carriers of the polymorphism were identified, and each had a significantly higher BMI (27.4 +/- 1.3 vs. 23.5 +/- 3.7 kg/m2 [mean +/- SD]; P = 0.032), lower SI [4.9 +/- 2.9 vs. 15.4 +/- 9.0 10(-5) x (min x pmol/l)-1; P = 0.013], and higher fasting serum C-peptide (730 +/- 155 vs. 471 +/- 158 pmol/l; P = 0.016) than the wild-type carriers. The homozygous carriers also had significantly higher levels of fasting serum triglyceride (P = 0.042) and serum LDL cholesterol (P = 0.013). When adjustments were made for age, sex, BMI, and VO2max in a multiple regression analysis, a significantly negative association was found between homozygosity for the codon 64 variant and the SI (P = 0.009). We conclude that in young healthy Danes, the homozygous form but not the heterozygous form of the codon 64 amino acid polymorphism of the beta 3-adrenergic receptor may be associated with obesity and, independent of BMI, with a low SI. Since only three homozygous carriers were identified among 380 subjects, the results must be interpreted with caution, and studies of larger population samples are needed.
9756945	Caveolin is an activator of insulin receptor signaling.	Recent data have demonstrated that caveolin, a major structural protein of caveolae, negatively regulates signaling molecules localized to caveolae. The interaction of caveolin with several caveolae-associated signaling proteins is mediated by the binding of the scaffolding region of caveolin to a hydrophobic amino acid-containing region within the regulated proteins. The presence of a similar motif within the insulin receptor kinase prompted us to investigate the caveolar localization and regulation of the insulin receptor by caveolin. We found that overexpression of caveolin-3 augmented insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 in 293T cells but not the phosphorylation of insulin receptor. Peptides corresponding to the scaffolding domain of caveolin potently stimulated insulin receptor kinase activity toward insulin receptor substrate-1 or a Src-derived peptide in vitro and in a caveolin subtype-dependent fashion. Peptides from caveolin-2 exhibited no effect, whereas caveolin-1 and -3 stimulated activity 10- and 17-fold, respectively. Peptides which increased insulin receptor kinase activity did so without affecting insulin receptor auto-phosphorylation. Furthermore, the insulin receptor bound to immobilized caveolin peptides, and this binding was inhibited in the presence of free caveolin-3 peptides. Thus, we have identified a novel mechanism by which the insulin receptor is bound and activated by specific caveolin subtypes. Furthermore, these data define a new role for caveolin as an activator of signaling.
7769500	Insertion variant in intron 9, but not microsatellite in intron 2, of the insulin receptor gene is associated with essential hypertension.	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a microsatellite polymorphism of the insulin receptor gene (INSR) is associated with essential hypertension, as has been demonstrated previously for an RsaI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and to examine blood pressure and plasma lipid profiles in relation to genotype. DESIGN AND METHODS: The study involved 75 Caucasian, non-diabetic hypertensive patients whose parents were both hypertensive, and 75 age-matched normotensive subjects whose parents were each normotensive after the age of 50 years. Genotypes for the microsatellite polymorphism were determined for each subject using leucocyte DNA and a polymerase chain reaction method. Other parameters, including pretreatment blood pressure, body mass index and plasma lipids, were also determined. RESULTS: Comparison of microsatellite data for the eight genotypes and four alleles that were detected showed no significant difference by chi 2 analysis, either between the hypertensive and normotensive groups, or between obese and non-obese subgroups of hypertensives. This is in contrast to the significantly higher frequency seen for the R1- allele of an RsaI RFLP of INSR: 0.71 in the hypertensive group compared with 0.56 in the normotensive group. R1- allele frequency was elevated in all age groups of hypertensives and did not differ between obese and non-obese subgroups. The non-obese hypertensives also had different plasma lipid profiles according to genotypes of the RFLP, with higher total and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol in patients having the hypertension-associated R1- allele of the intron 9 polymorphism. Moreover, systolic blood pressure was significantly greater in patients carrying the R1- allele and aged > or = 60 years. CONCLUSIONS: The present study allows definition of the hypertension-associated variants of INSR as those which are in linkage disequilibrium with a (CA)-repeat insertion polymorphism in intron 9 of the large, 22 exon, > 120-kb gene, but not those associated with a polymorphism in the second intron.
9886955	Early biochemical events in insulin-stimulated fluid phase endocytosis.	We examined the initial molecular mechanisms by which cells nonselectively internalize extracellular solutes in response to insulin. Insulin-stimulated fluid phase endocytosis (FPE) was examined in responsive cells, and the roles of the insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI 3'-kinase), Ras, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) were assessed. Active insulin receptors were essential, as demonstrated by the stimulation of FPE by insulin in HIRc-B cells (Rat-1 cells expressing 1.2 x 10(6) normal insulin receptors/cell) but not in untransfected Rat-1 cells or in Rat-1 cells expressing the inactive A/K1018 receptor. IRS-1 expression augmented insulin-stimulated FPE, as assessed in 32D cells, a hematopoietic precursor cell line lacking endogenous IRS-1. Insulin-stimulated FPE was inhibited in mouse brown adipose tissue (BAT) cells expressing the 17N dominant negative mutant Ras and was augmented in cells expressing wild-type Ras. The MEK inhibitor PD-98059 had little effect on insulin-stimulated FPE in BAT cells. In 32D cells, but not in HIRc-B and BAT cells, insulin-stimulated FPE was inhibited by 10 nM wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3'-kinase. The results indicate that the insulin receptor, IRS-1, Ras, and, perhaps in certain cell types, PI 3'-kinase are involved in mediating insulin-stimulated FPE.
10591678	A common mutation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 gene is a risk factor for coronary artery disease.	Insulin resistance is associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis. Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) plays a key role in tissue insulin sensitivity. A common mutation (G972R) of the IRS-1 gene has been shown to impair IRS-1 function, and it has been associated with reduced insulin sensitivity and lipid abnormalities. This led us to investigate the role of the G972R mutation in predisposing individuals to coronary artery disease (CAD). The DNA of 318 subjects with angiographically documented coronary atherosclerosis (>50% stenosis) and 208 population control subjects was analyzed for the presence of the G972R mutation. This mutation was detected by nested polymerase chain reaction and BstNI restriction enzyme digestion. The frequency of the G972R mutation was significantly higher among patients with CAD than controls (18. 9% versus 6.8%, respectively; P<0.001). After controlling for other coronary risk factors, the relative risk of CAD associated with the G972R mutation was 2.93 (95% CI 1.30 to 6.60; P<0.02) in the entire cohort. This risk was found to be even higher in the subgroups of obese subjects (odds ratio [OR] 6.97, 95% CI 2.24 to 21.4; P<0.001) and subjects with clinical features of insulin resistance syndrome (OR 27.3, 95% CI 7.19 to 104.0; P<0.001). The IRS-1 gene variant was associated with a higher frequency of diabetes mellitus (14.9% among carriers versus 6.5% among noncarriers; P<0.01) and with a 60% increase of plasma total triglycerides (P<0.001). Also, plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol were significantly (P<0.001) higher among carriers than noncarriers, although to lesser a extent. These effects were independent of CAD status. The G972R mutation in the IRS-1 gene was found to be a significant independent predictor of CAD. Moreover, this mutation greatly increased the risk of CAD in obese subjects and in patients with the cluster of abnormalities of insulin resistance syndrome. Besides the increased frequency of diabetes, carriers showed a more atherogenic lipid profile, suggesting a potential role of the IRS-1 gene in the pathogenesis of lipid abnormalities associated with CAD.
10632369	Specificity of alpha-cyano-beta-hydroxy-beta-methyl-n-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phe nyl]-propenamide as an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase.	The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase has an essential function for the survival of human breast cancer cells. In a systematic effort to design potent and specific inhibitors of this receptor family protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) as antibreast cancer agents, we recently reported the construction of a three-dimensional homology model of the EGFR kinase domain. In this model, the catalytic site is defined by two beta-sheets that form an interface at the cleft between the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal lobes of the kinase domain. Our modeling studies revealed a distinct, remarkably planar triangular binding pocket within the kinase domain with approximate dimensions of 15 A x 12 A x 12 A, and the thickness of the binding pocket is approximately 7 A with an estimated volume of approximately 600 A3 available for inhibitor binding. Molecular docking studies had identified alpha-cyano-beta-hydroxy-beta-methyl-N-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-p ropenamide (LFM-A12) as our lead inhibitor, with an estimated binding constant of 13 microM, which subsequently inhibited EGFR kinase in vitro with an IC50 value of 1.7 microM. LFM-A12 was also discovered to be a highly specific inhibitor of the EGFR. Even at very high concentrations ranging from 175-350 microM, this inhibitor did not affect the enzymatic activity of other PTKs, including the Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK3, the Src family kinase HCK, the Tec family member Bruton's tyrosine kinase, SYK kinase, and the receptor family PTK insulin receptor kinase. This observation is in contrast to the activity of a quinazoline inhibitor tested as a control, 4-(3-bromo, 4-hydroxyanilino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline, which was shown to inhibit EGFR and other tyrosine kinases such as HCK, JAK3, and SYK.
12926131	Association of genetic polymorphisms of glutathione-S-transferase genes (GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1) with familial prostate cancer risk in a Japanese population.	BACKGROUND: Glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) are active in the detoxification of a wide variety of toxins and carcinogens. The genetic polymorphisms of GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 genes have been studied to estimate the relative risk of various cancers. In the current study, we examined the association of the GST gene polymorphisms with familial prostate cancer in a Japanese population by performing a case-control study consisting of 81 familial prostate cancer cases and 105 normal controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: No significant association of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphisms with familial prostate cancer risk was found; however, the Val/Val genotype of the GSTP1 gene significantly increased risk (OR = 9.31, 95% CI = 0.47-184, p = 0.030). The combination analysis of genotypes of the three genes showed that presence of two high-risk genotypes, i.e., null genotype of the GSTM1 or GSTT1 gene, or any Val genotypes of the GSP1 gene, significantly increased the risk of prostate cancer (OR = 2.67, 95% CI = 1.08-6.59, p = 0.03). Stratification of cases according to the pathological grade or the clinical stage showed no significant differences among categories. CONCLUSION: In the present study, we found that genotypes of GSTs, especially the Val-allele of the GSTP1 gene and the combination of three genotypes, were associated with familial prostate cancer risk.
7736897	Molecular analysis of insulin receptor gene in Werner's syndrome.	Werner's syndrome is characterized by premature aging and frequent impaired glucose tolerance or overt diabetes. Insulin resistance may play an important role and may be caused by a post-receptor defect or dysfunctional insulin receptor. The present study was undertaken to investigate the insulin receptor gene mutation in Werner's syndrome. The genomic DNAs were obtained from four patients with Werner's syndrome. Exons 2-22 of the insulin receptor gene except exon 1 were amplified from genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction and screened for nucleotide variation by examining for single-stranded conformational polymorphisms. There were no nucleotide variations in exons 2, 4-->7, 9 and 12-->22. Variants were thus found in exons 3, 8, 10 and 11 and each were sequenced. The variant in exon 8 was due to a silent polymorphism (GAT-->GAC/T, Asp519) and other variants in exons 3, 10 and 11 were caused by nucleotide substitutions in introns. These results suggest that the patients with Werner's syndrome express normal insulin receptors and that the primary genetic lesion for insulin resistance is not in the insulin receptor gene. Insulin resistance in Werner's syndrome is thus likely by a post-receptor defect.
8612625	Role of insulin-like growth factors in autocrine growth of human retinoblastoma Y79 cells.	In this study, we have demonstrated that human retinoblastoma Y79 cells produce insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) type I and type II and release them into the medium. We have also ascertained, by means of competitive studies and cross-linking procedure, that Y79 cells contain the type-I IGF receptor (IGF-IR). Furthermore, surface-bound IGF-I is internalised by the receptor, then degraded to amino acids. Insulin, IGF-I and IGF-II caused down-regulation of IGF-IR; the effect is concentration and time dependent. Scatchard analysis demonstrated that incubation with insulin markedly decreased the binding capacity measured for IGF-I while the apparent Kd value calculated for IGF-I binding was not significantly modified. IGF-I, IGF-II and insulin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-IR. Tyrosine phosphorylation of this receptor with, however, a less strong signal, was detectable even in cells cultured in serum-free medium without the addition of any exogenous growth factor. Similar results have been found concerning the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS 1). Tyrosine phosphorylation of both IGF-IR and IRS 1, either under basal conditions or after stimulation with growth factors, was strongly inhibited when alpha-IR3, a monoclonal antibody to IGF-IR, was added to the culture. IGF-I was capable of inducing Y79 cell proliferation and its effect was entirely inhibited by the addition of alpha-IR3. This antibody also markedly reduced the proliferation of Y79 cells cultured in serum-free medium not supplemented with stimulatory factors. Our results indicate that IGF-I and IGF-IR mediate an autocrine growth mechanism in Y79 cells.
8621530	Interaction between the Grb10 SH2 domain and the insulin receptor carboxyl terminus.	Grb10 is a member of a recently identified family of adapter proteins that are thought to play a role in receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signal transduction. We identified and isolated the Grb10 SH2 domain based on its interaction with the intracellular domain of the insulin receptor beta-subunit using the yeast two-hybrid system. The interaction was specific for the insulin receptor and the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, and it required a catalytically active receptor kinase domain and an intact Grb10 SH2 domain. Glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing the Grb10 SH2 domain associated in an insulin-dependent manner with insulin receptors from cell lysates and with purified insulin receptors. Co-precipitation experiments revealed the association of cellular Grb10 with hormone-stimulated insulin receptors in cell extracts. The Grb10 SH2 domain did not bind to an insulin receptor lacking 43 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus, and it exhibited highest affinity for a phosphopeptide containing Tyr(P)-1322. Unlike p85 and Syp, which also bind to Tyr(P)-1322, Grb10 was not found to associate with insulin receptor substrate-1. These results suggest that Grb10 is a novel insulin receptor interactive protein and provide direct evidence for an insulin receptor substrate-1-independent function of the insulin receptor carboxyl terminus in protein binding.
12006603	Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptides compete for insulin binding to the insulin receptor.	The amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is neurotoxic and associated with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the effect of Abeta peptides on insulin binding to the insulin receptor because it is known that (1) Abeta and insulin are both amyloidogenic peptides sharing a common sequence recognition motif, (2) Abeta and insulin are substrates for the same insulin degrading enzyme, and (3) impaired glucose metabolism is a characteristic event in the pathology of AD. We discovered that Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42,) the main physiological forms, reduced insulin binding and receptor autophosphorylation. The reduction in binding was caused by a decrease in the affinity of insulin binding to the insulin receptor. This reduction was independent of the receptor concentration. The reverse, control peptide Abeta(40-1) did not reduce insulin binding or insulin receptor autophosphorylation. These results demonstrate that Abeta is a direct competitive inhibitor of insulin binding and action. We speculate that the increased levels of Abeta in Alzheimer's disease may be linked to the associated insulin resistance that has been observed previously in this disease.
12643471	Antisense targets to enhance hormone and cytotoxic therapies in advanced prostate cancer.	The main obstacle to improved survival of advanced prostate cancer is our failure to prevent or treat its progression to its lethal and untreatable stage of androgen independence. New therapeutic agents designed to prevent androgen-independent progression are required. Accelerated identification and characterization of cancer-relevant molecular targets has sparked considerable interest in the development of new generations of anti-cancer agents that specifically inhibit a progression-relevant target. Antisense oligonucleotides, short synthetic stretches of chemically modified DNA capable of specifically hybridizing to the mRNA of a chosen cancer-relevant target gene. promise to show enhanced specificity for malignant cells with a more favorable side-effect profile due to well-defined and tailored modes of action. Although not all of the challenges have been met to date, emerging clinical evidence supports the premise that antisense oligonucleotides stand a realistic chance of emerging as major partners of rationally designed anti-cancer regimens. The status of antisense targeting of several genes, including bcl-2, bcl-xL, clusterin, androgen receptor and IGFBPs, relevant to prostate and other cancers, are reviewed.
11145562	Transcriptional regulation of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor gene expression in prostate cancer cells.	A marked decrease in the type 1 insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor (IGF-IR) occurs in prostate epithelial cells during transformation from the benign to the metastatic state. One of the principal regulators of IGF-IR gene expression, the WT1 tumor suppressor, is expressed in prostate cancer and in prostate cancer cell lines. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the decrease in IGF-IR expression was transcriptionally regulated, and whether WT1 action may be involved in the repression of the IGF-IR gene in prostate cancer cells. The P69 cell line was derived by immortalization of human primary prostate epithelial cells with simian virus-40 T antigen and is rarely tumorigenic. The M12 line was derived from the P69 line by selection for tumor formation in nude mice and is tumorigeneic and metastatic. P69 cells express 20,000 IGF-IR/cell, whereas M12 cells express 3,500 IGF-IR/cell. These differences in receptor number are reflected in proportional differences in IGF-IR mRNA levels. To assess IGF-IR promoter activity in these cell lines, each was transiently transfected with luciferase reporter vectors containing the IGF-IR gene transcription start site and 476 bp of 5'-flanking sequence, 640 bp of 5'-untranslated region sequence, or both regions. The promoter activity of the full-length construct was 50% lower (P < 0.01) in M12 cells compared with P69 cells, the activity of the 5'-flanking region construct was 53% lower (P < 0.0001), and that of the 5'-untranslated region construct was 36% lower (P = 0.01). P69 clones stably transfected with a WT1 expression vector exhibited decreased expression of the endogenous IGF-IR gene and decreased promoter activity in transient transfection assays with IGF-IR promoter constructs containing multiple WT1 binding sites. The observed reduction in endogenous IGF-IR expression was sufficient to inhibit IGF-I-stimulated cell proliferation. These data suggest that most of the decreased expression of the IGF-IR seen in malignant prostate epithelium is the result of transcriptional repression of the IGF-IR gene, and that this repression may be due in part to the increased expression of the WT1 tumor suppressor in metastatic prostate cancer.
11461162	Insulin secretion as a determinant of pancreatic cancer risk.	New epidemiology confirms that glucose intolerance is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, and that this association cannot be accounted for by an adverse impact of early pancreatic cancer on beta cell function. Previous reports indicate that risk for pancreatic cancer is increased in adult-onset diabetics. Since streptozotocin diabetes inhibits carcinogen-mediated induction of pancreatic cancer in hamsters, the most reasonable interpretation of these findings is that insulin (or some other beta cell product) acts as a promoter for pancreatic carcinogenesis. This view is consistent with a report that human pancreatic adenocarcinomas express insulin receptors that can stimulate mitosis; an additional possibility is that high insulin levels indirectly promote pancreatic carcinogenesis by boosting effective IGF-I activity via hepatic actions. In international ecologic epidemiology, pancreatic cancer rates correlate tightly with dietary intake of animal products; this may reflect the fact that vegan diets are associated with low diurnal insulin secretion. There is also suggestive evidence that macrobiotic vegan diets, which are low in glycemic index, may increase mean survival time in pancreatic cancer. However, other types of diets associated with decreased postprandial insulin response, such as high-protein diets or 'Mediterranean' diets high in oleic acid, may also have the potential for pancreatic cancer prevention. The huge increases of age-adjusted pancreatic cancer mortality in Japan and among African-Americans during the last century imply that pancreatic cancer is substantially preventable; a low-insulin-response diet coupled with exercise training, weight control, and smoking avoidance, commendable for a great many other reasons, may slash pancreatic cancer mortality dramatically.
12702972	Coprocytobiology: on the nature of cellular elements from stools in the pathophysiology of colonic disease.	The gastrointestinal epithelium is known to undergo constant and rapid renewal resulting in millions of cells being shed into the fecal stream every day. The conventional wisdom was that these cells disintegrate upon exfoliation and will not survive the transit through the intestinal tract. In 1990, we (P.N.) made the discovery that a significant number of these cells remain intact and viable and that they can be isolated. The implications of this important discovery became apparent when we demonstrated that these cells are exclusively of colonic origin, are anatomically representative of the entire colon, and can be used for clinical investigations of disease processes. The term coprocytobiology (CCB) was coined to encompass the broad range of applications of this new technology. The somatic cell sampling and recovery (SCSR) process involves the isolation of exfoliated colonocytes from a small sample of stool ( approximately 1 g) collected and transported in a unique medium at ambient temperature, providing cells for the detection of a number of biomarkers of disease propensity. These exfoliated colonocytes express cytokeratins indicating epithelial lineage as well as colon-specific antigen. Over the years, the study of exfoliated colonocytes has provided striking new insights into the biology of colon cancer and inflammatory bowel disease, including detection of p53 gene mutations, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction amplification, and identification of CD44 splice variants, neoplasia-associated specific binding of plant lectins, and expression of COX-2, the inducible form of cyclooxygenase. The functional diversity of cells isolated by SCSR is revealed by the demonstration of cell surface markers such as secretory component, IgA, and IgG on the one hand and the amplification and cloning of the human insulin receptor and the expression of the multidrug resistance gene mdr-1 on the other hand. This review portrays the immense potential of CCB as a powerful tool for investigating the pathophysiology of disease, identifying genetic variants in pharmacogenetics, assessment of mucosal immunity, and several other applications that use somatic cells.
1341208	Papillomaviruses in human disease: Part II. Molecular biology and immunology of papillomavirus infections and carcinogenesis.	As summarized in the last issue of the EJM, human papillomaviruses induce a great variety of neoplastic lesions of mucosal epithelia and the skin. Particular types of these viruses are associated with specific human cancers, most notably anogenital carcinomas. These tumours account for about fifteen percent of the whole worldwide cancer burden. However, recent epidemiological studies revealed that papillomavirus infections including those with the cancer-related papillomavirus types are very widespread even among asymptomatic healthy individuals. Here, the current understanding of the molecular events leading to papillomavirus-induced tumours will be reviewed. It is assumed that these tumours arise as a consequence of several molecular modifications of persistently papillomavirus-infected epithelial cells. Experimental studies revealed that the virus types associated with anogenital cancers harbour two potential oncogenes referred to as E6 and E7. These viral genes are consistently expressed in HPV-associated anogenital carcinoma cells. HPV-associated cervical carcinoma cells loose their neoplastic growth properties if the expression of the E6 and E7 genes is inhibited. The proteins encoded by these viral genes thus appear to be ideal targets for a specific pharmacological approach to treat papillomavirus associated cancers or their respective precursor lesions. Recent studies in animals furthermore suggest that active vaccination with the viral oncoprotein E7 prevents growth of papillomavirus associated tumours. Hence, the possibility arises that also in man, vaccination with the viral transforming proteins might prevent the development of papillomavirus associated cancers.
7958399	Insulin stimulates thyroid hormone receptor alpha gene expression in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells.	Thyroid hormones and insulin regulate numerous cell processes and potentially interact through the transcriptional regulation of key genes. For instance, thyroid hormones stimulate the transcription of the fatty acid synthase and malic enzyme genes in chick embryonic hepatocytes, while insulin amplifies these effects. It is possible that insulin augments these actions of thyroid hormone by stimulating production of the thyroid hormone nuclear receptor (TR). In these studies, we examined the regulation of TR production/gene expression by insulin in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). We demonstrate that insulin significantly stimulates the gene expression of the TR alpha receptor, from BAEC. Insulin causes a maximal threefold induction above control TR alpha steady state mRNA levels in time and dose-related fashion in these cells. The increased mRNA mainly resulted from a twofold increase in transcription, as determined by nuclear run on. Insulin also increases thyroid receptor number and thyroid hormone binding, determined by Scatchard analysis of competitive inhibition binding studies. An established observation is that insulin can synergistically augment thyroid hormone-induced transcriptional activation of several important genes. It has also been previously determined that thyroid hormone action correlates closely to TR nuclear receptor number. Therefore, our studies, which show that insulin stimulates TR alpha production, suggests a potential mechanism whereby insulin can augment thyroid hormone transcriptional action.
8049217	Deletion of 343 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor inhibits insulin signaling.	Naturally occurring mutations in the insulin receptor gene that impair the receptor tyrosine kinase activity cause insulin resistance in vivo in a dominant fashion. Previously, two unrelated families have been described that express an insulin receptor with a truncation due to a premature chain termination at codon 1000 (delta 1000), thereby deleting 343 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of the beta-subunit. While clinical findings suggest that the truncated receptor does not mediate insulin action in vivo, a recent study suggested that a similarly truncated receptor enhanced insulin sensitivity in transfected cells by augmenting the signaling by endogenous receptors [Sasaoka, T., Takata, Y., Kusari, J., Anderson, C. M., Langlois, W. J., & Olefsky, J. M. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 4379-4383]. To investigate these paradoxical data, we studied the structure and function of delta 1000 truncated insulin receptors when expressed in NIH-3T3 cells. We found that, despite the deletion of most of the tyrosine kinase domain and all of the C-terminal domain of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor, the delta 1000 mutant receptors were processed normally and were transported to the plasma membrane where they bind insulin with high affinity. Following ligand addition, the truncated receptors are degraded with a normal half-life. However, they fail to undergo insulin-stimulated internalization, do not regulate the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1, and are unable to mediate an insulin-stimulated increase in DNA synthesis and c-jun and c-fos expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
10188722	Genetic pattern of prostate cancer progression.	Genetic alterations in primary prostate cancer (CaP) have been extensively studied, yet little is known about the genetic mechanisms underlying progression of primary CaP to metastatic prostate cancer. As a result, it is not possible to distinguish clinically indolent localized disease from potentially life-threatening tumors with high metastatic potential. To address this question, we collected tissue from 34 autopsy-derived metastases, samples rarely analyzed in previous studies. These were compared to a separate set of 17 prostatectomy specimens containing 22 foci of CaP associated with 49 examples of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), a histological precursor of CaP. We compared the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) profiles of high-grade PIN, primary CaP and metastases by analyzing 33 microsatellite markers previously found to have high frequencies of LOH in primary CaP. These markers were on chromosomes 5q, 6q, 7q, 8p, 9p, 10q, 11p, 13q, 16q, 17, 18q and 21q. In addition, markers on chromosomes 4p, 11q, 14q and 20q with no reported LOH in primary CaP were analyzed to determine the frequency of background LOH. In PIN lesions, the rate of LOH was significant only at D5S806 (20%) and D16S422 (29%). In addition, different PIN lesions within the same prostate gland were genetically diverse, indicating divergent evolution of synchronous neoplastic precursor lesions. LOH frequency was progressively higher in primary CaP and metastatic lesions. In primary CaP, significant losses occurred at the 8p, 10q, 11p, 16q, 17p, 18q and 21q loci (range 17-43%). Distinct patterns of LOH frequencies were observed in primary CaP compared with metastases. Although some loci (D16S422, D17S960, D21S156) showed similar frequencies of LOH in primary CaP and metastatic CaP, most other loci showed up to 7-fold metastasis-related increases. The metastatic samples revealed previously unrecognized prostate cancer LOH at D5S806, D6S262, D9S157, D13S133 and D13S227. These significant stage-specific differences in LOH frequency specify genetic loci that may play key roles in CaP progression and could represent clinically useful biomarkers for CaP aggressiveness.
14599874	In vitro downregulation of growth factors by insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 in cervical cancer.	OBJECTIVES: Our hypothesis is that insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGF-BP3) would downregulate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) levels in cervical cancer cell lines, thereby reducing cellular IGF-II and angiogenesis-related vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF). As folate deficiency is a risk factor in cervical cancer, we sought to determine if folic acid treatment might increase IGF-BP3 production, thereby inhibiting malignant cell proliferation. METHODS: We determined the cellular levels of EGF-R, IGF-II, and VEGF in the cervical cancer cell lines HeLa, ME-180 (both positive for human papilloma virus; HPV), and HT-3 (HPV-negative), following their treatment with IGF-BP3. Levels of IGF-BP3 in these cells before and after treatment with folic acid and VEGF were also enumerated, using a computerized semiquantitative immunofluorescent antibody assay. RESULTS: Treatment with IGF-BP3 significantly reduced the levels (mean intensity per pixel) of EGF-R, IGF-II, and VEGF in all three cell lines and IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) in representative ME-180 cell line. Treatment with antiproliferative folic acid increased IGF-BP3 levels while the proliferative VEGF depleted cellular IGF-BP3 in all the cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of EGF-R, IGF-II, IGF-IR, and VEGF are significantly reduced following treatment with IGF-BP3 in cervical cancer. We observed increased levels of IGF-BP3 by folic acid, and decreased IGF-BP3 levels by VEGF. Downregulation of EGF-R by IGF-BP3 suggests an IGF-independent action. Folate deficiency is a risk factor in cervical cancer. Our results suggest that folic acid supplementation can lead to inhibition of cervical cancer cell growth by promoting increased IGF-BP3 levels.
7535629	Insulin and insulin-like growth factor system components gene expression in the chicken retina from early neurogenesis until late development and their effect on neuroepithelial cells.	To better understand the role of insulin-related growth factors in neural development, we have characterized by in situ hybridization in chicken embryonic retina the patterns of gene expression for insulin, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), their respective receptors and the IGF binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) from early stages (E6) until late stages (E18)--an analysis not performed yet in any species. In addition, we studied the effect of insulin and IGF-I on cultured neuroepithelial cells. Insulin receptor mRNA and IGF-I receptor mRNA were both present and showed a similar, widespread pattern throughout retina development. Insulin mRNA could be detected only by reverse transcription coupled to polymerase chain reaction. IGF-I mRNA was concentrated in the ciliary processes and extraocular muscles early in development (embryonic day 6; E6) and in maturing retinal ganglion cells subsequently (E9-15). IGFBP5 mRNA was preferentially localized in the more differentiated central retinal zone and was maximally concentrated in the inner nuclear and ganglion cell layers at E9. These findings suggest a near constitutive expression of insulin receptor and IGF-I receptor genes, while IGF-I and IGFBP5 showed a highly focal spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression. Insulin and IGF-I, already at 10(-8) M, increased the proportion of PM1-positive neuroepithelial cells found in E5 retinal cultures without affecting significantly the total number of proliferating cells. Together, these data support the finding that, during early neurogenesis in chicken retina, insulin and IGF-I have a specific paracrine/autocrine action. This action, as well as possible effects elicited subsequently, may be dictated by restricted-local synthesis of the ligands and limited access to the factors contained in the vitreous humour. In the case of IGF's role, local IGFBPs expression can contribute to the fine modulation.
7852302	Insulin receptor signaling is augmented by antisense inhibition of the protein tyrosine phosphatase LAR.	Considerable evidence has shown that most physiologic responses to insulin require activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase of the insulin receptor. Biochemical studies have also supported the hypothesis that receptor kinase activity can be modulated by cellular protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases), which have not yet been identified. To test the hypothesis that the transmembrane PTPase LAR can modulate insulin receptor signaling in vivo, antisense RNA expression was used to specifically suppress LAR protein levels by 63% in the rat hepatoma cell line, McA-RH7777. Hormone-dependent autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor was increased by approximately 150% in the antisense-expressing cells at all insulin concentrations tested. This increase in autophosphorylation was paralleled by a 35% increase in insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Reduced LAR levels did not alter non-hormone-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation nor basal insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity. Most significantly, reduced LAR levels resulted in a 350% increase in insulin-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. These studies provide unique in vivo evidence that LAR is involved in the modulation of insulin receptor signaling in intact cells.
10363793	Proliferative disorders of the aging human prostate: involvement of protein hormones and their receptors.	The majority of elderly men is affected by benign and malignant diseases of the prostate. Both proliferative disorders, i.e., benign hyperplasia of the prostate (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa)-which has recently emerged as the most common male malignancy in industrialized countries-seem to be governed by endocrine factors such as sex steroid hormones, but auto/paracrine factors are involved as well. Age-related changes in levels and ratios of endocrine factors as androgens, estrogens, gonadotropins, and prolactin (PRL) and changes in the balance between auto/paracrine growth-stimulatory and growth-inhibitory factors such as insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), epidermal growth factor (EGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), and transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) are meant to be responsible for abnormal prostatic growth. We investigated the existence of putative local regulatory circuits involving the protein hormones, human growth hormone (hGH), human placental lactogen (hPL), and hPRL, and their corresponding receptors in prostatic tissue specimens (transurethral resections of the prostate, TURP; n = 11), in the prostatic cancer cell lines PC3, Du145, LnCap, a virus-transformed BPH cell line (BPH-1), and in a normal healthy prostate by RT-PCRs and highly specific and sensitive immunofluorometric assays (IFMA). Neither hPRL nor hGH was detected at the mRNA or protein levels in prostatic tissue and cell lines, with the exception of 2 of 11 prostatic TURP-samples, which showed weak expression of the PL-A/B genes. PRL- and GH-receptors were expressed in all normal and pathological prostatic specimens. Surprisingly, PRL-receptor expression was not detectable in prostatic cancer cell lines. The trophic effects of exogenous hGH, hPL, and hPRL were investigated by cell proliferation assays (WST-I) in prostatic primary cell cultures and PCa cell lines. hGH significantly (p < 0.005) increased cell proliferation up to 138+/-3.2% (1 nM hGH), while hPL and hPRL revealed only moderate effects. Our data suggest that local auto/paracrine networks of protein hormone actions are not involved in the pathology of BPH or prostatic cancer. On the other hand, systemic pituitary-derived hGH can increase the proliferative response of BPH and PCa, acting directly on the target organ prostate, via the hGH-R. In this case, envisaged GH substitution in elderly people must be viewed at with caution because age-related declines in GH/IGF-I could act as a protective mechanism against abnormal cell growth.
7604885	Increased central nervous system production of extracellular matrix components and development of hydrocephalus in transgenic mice overexpressing transforming growth factor-beta 1.	A number of important neurological diseases, including HIV-1 encephalitis, Alzheimer's disease, and brain trauma, are associated with increased cerebral expression of the multifunctional cytokine transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). To determine whether overexpression of TGF-beta 1 within the central nervous system (CNS) can contribute to the development of neuropathological alterations, a bioactive form of TGF-beta 1 was expressed in astrocytes of transgenic mice. Transgenic mice with high levels of cerebral TGF-beta 1 expression developed a severe communicating hydrocephalus, seizures, motor incoordination, and early runting. While unmanipulated heterozygous transgenic mice from a low expressor line showed no such alterations, increasing TGF-beta 1 expression in this line by injury-induced astroglial activation or generation of homozygous offspring did result in the abnormal phenotype. Notably, astroglial overexpression of TGF-beta 1 consistently induced a strong upmodulation of the extracellular matrix proteins laminin and fibronectin in the CNS, particularly in the vicinity of TGF-beta 1-expressing perivascular astrocytes, but was not associated with obvious CNS infiltration by hematogenous cells. While low levels of extracellular matrix protein expression may assist in CNS wound repair and regeneration, excessive extracellular matrix deposition could result in the development of hydrocephalus. As an effective inducer of extracellular matrix components, TGF-beta 1 may also contribute to the development of other neuropathological alterations, eg, the formation of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease.
8623837	The effect of transforming growth factor-beta on steroidogenesis and expression of key steroidogenic enzymes with a human ovarian thecal-like tumor cell model.	OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the effects of transforming growth factor-beta on steroidogenesis and regulation of steroidogenic enzyme expression by use of a human ovarian thecal-like tumor cell culture system. STUDY DESIGN: Human ovarian thecal-like tumor cells were treated in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of forskolin and transforming growth factor-beta 1. The accumulation of progesterone and androstenedione in the culture medium was evaluated by radioimmunoassay. The effects of forskolin with or without transforming growth factor-beta 1 on the enzymatic activity of P450c17 and 3 beta HSD, the expression of immunodetectable P450c17 protein, and the expression of messenger ribonucleic acid for P450scc, P450c17, and 3 beta HSD were determined. RESULTS: Basal steroid secretion, steroidogenic enzyme activity, enzyme protein, and messenger ribonucleic acid expression were not affected by transforming growth factor-beta 1 alone. Forskolin treatment significantly stimulated steroid production and the enzymatic activity of P450c17 and 3 beta HSD up to 10-fold above basal levels. However, transforming growth factor-beta 1 inhibited forskolin-stimulated androstenedione production to near basal levels and increased progesterone 1.4- to 2-fold while suppressing P450c17 enzyme activity to near basal levels, but it did not affect 3 beta HSD activity. Forskolin-stimulated immunodetectable P450c17 alpha protein was markedly inhibited by transforming growth factor-beta 1. In addition, transforming growth factor-beta 1 markedly inhibited the forskolin-stimulation of P450c17 messenger ribonucleic acid, while not significantly altering P450scc or 3 beta HSD messenger ribonucleic acid expression. CONCLUSION: Forskolin stimulated human ovarian thecal-like tumor cell steroidogenesis, P450c17 and 3 beta HSD activity, immunodetectable P450c17, and messenger ribonucleic acid content for P450scc, P450c17, and 3 beta HSD. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 inhibited forskolin stimulation of androstenedione production through the inhibition of P450c17 expression.
9335500	Amyloidogenic role of cytokine TGF-beta1 in transgenic mice and in Alzheimer's disease.	Deposition of amyoid-beta peptide in the central nervous system is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and a possible cause of neurodegeneration. The factors that initiate or promote deposition of amyloid-beta peptide are not known. The transforming growth factor TGF-beta1 plays a central role in the response of the brain to injury, and increased TGF-beta1 has been found in the central nervous system of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Here we report that TGF-beta1 induces amyloid-beta deposition in cerebral blood vessels and meninges of aged transgenic mice overexpressing this cytokine from astrocytes. Co-expression of TGF-beta1 in transgenic mice overexpressing amyloid-precursor protein, which develop Alzheimer's like pathology, accelerated the deposition of amyloid-beta peptide. More TGF-beta1 messenger RNA was present in post-mortem brain tissue of Alzheimer's patients than in controls, the levels correlating strongly with amyloid-beta deposition in the damaged cerebral blood vessels of patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. These results indicate that overexpression of TGF-beta1 may initiate or promote amyloidogenesis in Alzheimer's disease and in experimental models and so may be a risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease.
9562510	Age-related activation of microglia and astrocytes: in vitro studies show persistent phenotypes of aging, increased proliferation, and resistance to down-regulation.	Astrocytes and microglia from cerebral cortex of 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month-old F344 male rat donors showed progressively greater proliferation during primary culture. Microglia from aging donor brains exhibited an amoeboid-like morphology and express antigens characteristic of an activated state (e.g., major histocompatibility complex class II). Moreover, microglia from aging donors were less sensitive to several types of regulators. Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor stimulated proliferation in microglia from young, but not aging brains. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 inhibited astrocytic and microglial proliferation in cultures from young, but not aging donors. Similarly, the inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced NO production by TGF-beta1 in microglia was impaired in cultures from 12-month (middle-age) brains. Another aging change detected by middle age, increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression, also persisted in astrocytes from 12- to 24-month-old brains, as evaluated by increased activity of a 5'-upstream GFAP promoter construct. Thus, both microglia and astrocytes originated from aging cerebral cortex maintain in vitro at least some of the activated phenotypes of aging glia that are observed in vivo. This new in vitro cell model may allow efficient analysis of glial age changes.
9761057	Role of transforming growth factor-beta1 in the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease.	OBJECT: Prominent features of moyamoya disease are intimal thickening of the cerebral arterial trunks and abundant angiogenesis for collateral blood supplies, but its pathogenesis is still unknown. The aim of this study was to test the possibility that transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1) may play a role in the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease. METHODS: The authors used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to analyze the expression level of TGFbeta1 in smooth-muscle cells cultured from the superficial temporal arteries (STAs) and measured the serum level of TGFbeta1 by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although the STA is not predominantly involved with moyamoya disease, it has been used in studies of the pathogenesis of this disease. In this report, the STAs from six patients with moyamoya disease and four with arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease, along with sera from 14 patients with moyamoya disease and 10 normal healthy volunteers, were studied. The expression of TGFbeta1 was significantly higher in cultured smooth-muscle cells derived from the STAs of patients with moyamoya disease than in those derived from the STAs of patients with arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease (p < 0.05). The serum level of TGFbeta1 was also significantly higher in patients with moyamoya disease than in controls (p < 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account the functional roles of TGFbeta1 in the expression of connective tissue genes and angiogenesis, these investigators suggest that TGFbeta1 is associated with the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease, including abundant neovascularization, although their findings do not necessarily mean that TGFbeta1 is a causative factor in this disease.
10507529	Bcl-X(L) inhibits apoptosis and necrosis produced by Alzheimer's beta-amyloid1-40 peptide in PC12 cells.	Recent studies have shown that neuronal apoptosis induced by the Alzheimer's disease (AD) beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is related to alteration of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. It has been demonstrated that Bcl-X(L) (Bcl-X(L) = protein, bcl-X(L) = gene), a Bcl-2-related protein, prevents apoptosis in mammalian cells. Additionally, TGF-beta1 is able to protect cultured neuronal cells from Abeta-induced apoptosis via upregulation of bcl-X(L) and bcl-2 gene expression. We show that Abeta treatment (500 nM, freshly solubilized) results in apoptosis and necrosis in differentiated PC12 cells maintained with a low dose of NGF-beta (1 ng/ml). To investigate whether transfection of PC12 cells with bcl-X(L) could block Abeta-induced apoptosis, we transfected these cells with a bcl-X(L) construct (pcDNA-bcl-X(L)). Data show that bcl-X(L) significantly inhibits both early-stage apoptosis and late-stage apoptosis/necrosis produced by Abeta treatment (1000 nM) in pcDNA3-bcl-X(L)-transfected PC12 cells as compared with pcDNA3 vector-transfected PC12 cells. These results suggest that Bcl-X(L) exhibits both anti-necrotic as well as anti-apoptotic roles in Abeta-challenged PC12 cells.
10594789	Increased expression of TGF-beta1 but not of its receptors contributes to human obstructive nephropathy.	UNLABELLED: Increased expression of TGF-beta1 but not of its receptors contributes to human obstructive nephropathy. BACKGROUND: Previous studies have revealed an increased expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and deposition of extracellular matrix in the kidney of animals with ureteral obstruction. However, these relationships have not been elucidated in the hydronephrotic kidney of humans. METHODS: We analyzed the tissue expression of extracellular matrix proteins, TGF-beta1, and its receptors in the human kidney with ureteral obstruction by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Obstructed kidneys (OBKs) were obtained from patients with ureteral tumors. A kidney specimen from patients with a renal tumor was used as control (CNKs). RESULTS: The interstitial volume was significantly increased in OBKs in comparison with CNKs. OBKs showed increased deposition of collagen types I and IV and fibronectin in the renal interstitium. RT-PCR revealed overexpression of collagen alpha1(IV) mRNA and fibronectin mRNA in OBKs. OBKs showed a significantly increased mRNA expression of TGF-beta1 in comparison with CNKs. The immunoreactivity for TGF-beta1 increased markedly in the interstitium of OBKs. There was a significant correlation between the TGF-beta1 mRNA level and the interstitial volume. However, there was no significant difference between OBKs and CNKs in the relative mRNA level nor in immunoreactivity for TGF-beta receptors. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that TGF-beta1 may contribute to the interstitial fibrosis found in the human kidney with ureteral obstruction, mainly because of an increase in the expression of this cytokine without significant changes to its receptors.
10914688	Analysis of genetic polymorphisms in the transforming growth factor-beta1 gene and the risk of Alzheimer's disease.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disease involving several genetic and environmental components. Genetic studies have yet to identify all the genes involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a candidate gene for AD. It is a multifunctional cytokine whose overexpression has been shown to promote the deposition of amyloid-beta peptide. The goal of this study was to investigate the association of three polymorphisms in TGF-beta1 with the risk of AD. Two of the polymorphisms are located in the 5' region at positions -800 (G-->A) and -509 (C-->T), and the third is in exon 5 at codon 263 (Thr-->Ile). We screened DNA samples from 428 sporadic, late-onset patients and 421 controls by PCR-based assays. There was no statistically significant difference in genotype or allele frequency distributions between cases and controls for the -800 or codon 263 polymorphisms (P=0.38 and P=0.60, respectively). The overall genotype distribution at the -509 site was significantly different between cases and controls. (P=0.017). The frequency of the -509/TT genotype was significantly higher in AD patients than controls (P=0.015). We further tested whether this polymorphism may alter the regulation of the TGF-beta1 gene using dual luciferase reporter assay. We subcloned the 5' flanking region, which contained the -509 C/T polymorphic sites, in front of the firefly luciferase reporter gene in pGL-3 basic vector and co-transfected with the pRL-CMV vector containing Renilla luciferase gene as a control for transfection efficiency in COS-1 cells. The activity of each promoter allele was directly measured by the ratio of firefly luciferase activity to Renilla luciferase activity. The -509 T allele was associated with marginally higher transcriptional activity of TGF-beta compared with the -509 C allele (P=0.051). These data suggest that the -509 polymorphism of TGF-beta1 may be modestly associated with the risk of AD. However, these data should be interpreted with caution as the differences associated with the -509 alleles in both the genetic association and the transfection studies were modest.
11114266	Costimulatory effects of interferon-gamma and interleukin-1beta or tumor necrosis factor alpha on the synthesis of Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 by human astrocytes.	Chronic inflammation and astrocytosis are characteristic histopathological features of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Astrocytes are one of the predominant cell types in the brain. In AD they are activated and produce inflammatory components such as complement components, acute phase proteins, and cytokines. In this study we analyzed the effect of cytokines on the production of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the astrocytoma cell line U373 and in primary human astrocytes isolated postmortem from healthy aged persons as well as from patients with AD. Astrocytes did not produce Abeta in the absence of stimuli or following stimulation with IL-1beta, TNFalpha, IL-6, and TGF-beta1. Neither did combinations of TNFalpha and IL-1beta, IL-6 or TGF-beta1, or the coadministration of IFNgamma and IL-6 or TGF-beta1 induce Abeta production. In contrast, pronounced production of Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 was observed when primary astrocytes or astrocytoma cells were stimulated with combinations of IFNgamma and TNFalpha or IFNgamma and IL-1beta. Induction of Abeta production was accompanied by decreased glycosylation of APP as well as by increased secretion of APPsbeta. Our results suggest that astrocytes may be an important source of Abeta in the presence of certain combinations of inflammatory cytokines. IFNgamma in combination with TNFalpha or IL-1beta seems to trigger Abeta production by supporting beta-secretase cleavage of the immature APP molecule.
11211053	Amyloid precursor protein beta-secretase (BACE) mRNA expression in human neural cell lines following induction of neuronal differentiation and exposure to cytokines and growth factors.	Recently, a novel amyloid precursor protein beta-secretase (designated BACE) was identified. Because activated microglia and astrocytes play a role in amyloidogenesis in Alzheimer's disease, the constitutive and glial cytokine/growth factor-regulated expression of BACE was studied in human neural cell lines. By reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, BACE mRNA expression was identified in various human neural and non-neural cell lines. By northern blot analysis, the expression of BACE mRNA composed of five distinct transcripts (>8.0, 7.0, 6.0, 4.4 and 2.6 kb) was elevated markedly in NTera2 teratocarcinoma cells following retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation. But the levels of three major BACE mRNA species (7.0, 6.0 and 4.4 kb) were not significantly altered in NTera2-derived neurons, SK-N-SH neuroblastoma or U-373MG astrocytoma following exposure to tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, interferon-gamma, transforming growth factor-beta1, epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. These results indicate that BACE mRNA is expressed constitutively in human neural cells and its expression is upregulated during neuronal differentiation, but it is unlikely to be regulated by activated glia-derived cytokines and growth factors.
11722027	Systemic steroid pretreatment improves cerebral protection after circulatory arrest.	BACKGROUND: This study evaluates whether systemic steroid pretreatment enhances neuroprotection during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) compared with steroid in cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) prime. METHODS: Four-week-old piglets randomly placed into two groups (n = 5 per group) were given methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) into the pump prime (group PP), or pretreated intravenously 4 hours before CPB (group PT). All animals underwent 100 minutes of DHCA (15 degrees C), were weaned off CPB, and were sacrificed 6 hours later. Postoperative changes in body weight, bioimpedance, and colloid oncotic pressure (COP) were measured. Cerebral trypan blue content, immunohistochemical evaluation of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) expression, and caspase-3 activity were performed. RESULTS: Percentage weight gain (group PP 25.0% +/- 10.4% versus group PT 12.5% +/- 4.0%; p = 0.036), and percentage decrease in bioimpedance (PP 37.2% +/- 14.5% versus PT 15.6% +/- 7.9%; p = 0.019) were significantly lower, whereas postoperative COP was significantly higher in group PT versus group PP (PT 15.3 +/- 1.8 mm Hg versus PP 11.6 +/- 0.8 mm Hg; p = 0.003). Cerebral trypan blue (ng/g dry tissue) was significantly lower in group PT (PT 5.6 x 10(-3) +/- 1.1 x 10(-3) versus PP 9.1 x 10(-3) +/- 5.7 x 10(-4); p = 0.001). Increased TGF-beta1 expression and decreased caspase-3 activity were shown in group PT. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic steroid pretreatment significantly reduced total body edema and cerebral vascular leak and was associated with better immunohistochemical indices of neuroprotection after DHCA.
11924651	Genetic susceptibility in Dupuytren's disease. TGF-beta1 polymorphisms and Dupuytren's disease.	Dupuytren's disease is a benign fibroproliferative disease of unknown aetiology. It is often familial and commonly affects Northern European Caucasian men, but genetic studies have yet to identify the relevant genes. Transforming growth factor beta one (TGF-beta1) is a multifunctional cytokine which plays a central role in wound healing and fibrosis. It stimulates the proliferation of fibroblasts and the deposition of extracellular matrix. Previous studies have implicated TGF-beta1 in Dupuytren's disease, suggesting that it may represent a candidate susceptibility gene for this condition. We have investigated the association of four common single nucleotide polymorphisms in TGF-beta1 with the risk of developing Dupuytren's disease. A polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method was used for genotyping TGF-beta1 polymorphisms. DNA samples from 135 patients with Dupuytren's disease and 200 control subjects were examined. There was no statistically significant difference in TGF-beta1 genotype or allele frequency distributions between the patients and controls for the codons 10, 25, -509 and -800 polymorphisms. Our observations suggest that common TGF-beta1 polymorphisms are not associated with a risk of developing Dupuytren's disease. These data should be interpreted with caution since the lack of association was shown in only one series of patients with only known, common polymorphisms of TGF-beta1. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a case-control association study in Dupuytren's disease using single nucleotide polymorphisms in TGF-beta1.
11955370	[Change of gene expression of transforming growth factor-beta1, Smad 2 and Smad 3 in hypertrophic scars skins].	OBJECTIVE: To explore the regulatory mechanisms of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and two transcriptional factors Smad 2, 3 on hypertrophic scar formation and fetal scarless healing. METHODS: Thirty-two cases were detected to compare the gene expression of TGF-beta1, Smad 2 and Smad 3 with RT-PCR. Among those cases, there were 8 cases of hypertrophic scars, 8 cases of control skins, 8 cases of fetal skins and 8 cases of adult skins. RESULTS: TGF-beta1, Smad 2 and Smad 3 gene expression could all be detected in hypertrophic scars, fetal and adult skins. Among 8 groups examinated in this experiment (each group comprised a hypertrophic scar and its corresponding normal skin), there were 5, 8 and 5 groups in which TGF-beta1, Smad 2 and Smad 3 gene expression were higher in hypertrophic scars than in normal skins respectively. The fetal skins showed significantly lower level of TGF-beta1 and Smad 3 gene expression compared with adult skins (t = 2.204, P < 0.05 and t = 4.269, P < 0.01 respectively), while mRNA contents of Smad 2 were obviously higher in fetal skins than in adult skins (t = 6.685, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: TGF-beta1 and its downstream signal molecules Smad 2, Smad 3 might be involved in hypertrophic scar formation. Higher gene expression of TGF-beta1, Smad 2 and Smad 3 in hypertrophic scars might lead to stimulating extracellular matrix deposition, inducing fibroblast proliferation and accelerating fibrogenesis. Lower mRNA contents of TGF-beta1 and Smad 3 in fetal skins compared with adult skins might be associated with fetal scarless healing.
12099697	Transcriptional activation and increase in expression of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid precursor protein gene is mediated by TGF-beta in normal human astrocytes.	The overexpression of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its subsequent proteolytic processing may be one of several factors contributing to amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) deposition in plaques and microvasculature in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Cytokines and growth factors can influence the expression of APP in response to brain injury, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We examined the mechanisms by which transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) affects the expression of APP in normal human astrocytes. We report that, TGF-beta up-regulated the expression of APP at the transcription level as determined by nuclear run-on experiments. Transient transfection of astrocytes with APP gene promoter (-2832 bp) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter constructs led to increased reporter activity upon TGF-beta stimulation. This reporter activity was mainly attributed to the APP proximal domain (-488 bp). The increase in APP gene transcription was associated with significant accumulation of intracellular APP, APP carboxyl terminal derived fragments, and total secreted Abeta. In addition, we observed a significant increase in levels of TGF-beta in Abeta plaques and its immediate vicinity in AD-affected brain relative to controls. These results indicate that high levels of TGF-beta in the cortex, may serve to up-regulate APP synthesis in reactive astrocytes and indirectly contributes to Abeta deposition. Closely related processes may induce cerebrovascular pathology in AD brain.
12565837	Role of high mobility group protein-1 (HMG1) in amyloid-beta homeostasis.	In Alzheimer's disease (AD), fibrillar amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides form senile plaques associated with activated microglia. Recent studies have indicated that microglial Abeta clearance is facilitated by several activators such as transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). The relationship between microglia and Abeta formation and deposition is still unclear. In the present study, high mobility group protein-1 (HMG1) inhibited the microglial uptake of Abeta (1-42) in the presence and absence of TGF-beta1. In addition, HMG1 bound to Abeta (1-42) and stabilized the oligomerization. In AD brains, protein levels of HMG1 were significantly increased in both the cytosolic and particulate fractions, and HMG1 and Abeta were colocalized in senile plaques associated with microglia. These results suggest that HMG1 may regulate the homeostasis of extracellular Abeta (1-42) and Abeta oligomerization.
12626500	Transforming growth factor-beta 1 potentiates amyloid-beta generation in astrocytes and in transgenic mice.	Accumulation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in the brain is crucial for development of Alzheimer's disease. Expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), an immunosuppressive cytokine, has been correlated in vivo with Abeta accumulation in transgenic mice and recently with Abeta clearance by activated microglia. Here, we demonstrate that TGF-beta1 drives the production of Abeta40/42 by astrocytes leading to Abeta production in TGF-beta1 transgenic mice. First, TGF-beta1 induces the overexpression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in astrocytes but not in neurons, involving a highly conserved TGF-beta1-responsive element in the 5'-untranslated region (+54/+74) of the APP promoter. Second, we demonstrated an increased release of soluble APP-beta which led to TGF-beta1-induced Abeta generation in both murine and human astrocytes. These results demonstrate that TGF-beta1 potentiates Abeta production in human astrocytes and may enhance the formation of plaques burden in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients.
8123367	Revisiting the role of the nurse practitioner in the 1990s: a Canadian perspective.	The role of the nurse practitioner was first introduced in the North American health care scene in the early 1960s. In the 1970s, the concept of an expanded practice role for nurses was gaining interest in Canada. The impetus for development of the role in the United States was stimulated by a shortage of physicians. In Canada, the original nurse practitioner (NP) movement was influenced by the changing role of the nurse, the debate over a new category of health care worker in the United States (the physician assistant), and a perceived physician shortage. Canadian nurses saw the NP role as an opportunity to expand their scope of practice. This role expansion into traditional medical areas of practice was operationalized in various settings largely outside of the tertiary care sector. The role was controversial at times in terms of title and role function. However, it did present the nursing profession with an opportunity to demonstrate the impact nurses have on the health status of Canadians.
8764055	Transforming growth factor beta1 induces differentiation in human papillomavirus-positive keratinocytes.	Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are implicated in the etiology of anogenital cancers. Expression of the HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins is believed to contribute to the carcinogenic process. Progressive loss of the ability to differentiate and resistance to the growth-inhibitory effects of endogenous signals also appear important in multistep tumorigenesis. Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a potent growth inhibitor for a variety of cultured cells. There have been conflicting reports on the ability of TGF-beta1 to inhibit the growth of HPV-positive keratinocytes in monolayer cultures. We have employed the organotypic (raft) tissue culture system, which more accurately mimics the in vivo cellular environment and architecture. We have investigated the TGF-beta1 response of HPV-positive keratinocytes derived from neoplastic cervical biopsies. Growth of these cell lines as raft tissues showed that many were altered in the ability to stratify and synthesize differentiation-specific proteins. When the organotypic tissues were treated with TGF-beta1, a more complete differentiation of the keratinocytes was induced. Treatment with 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate gave similar results. TGF-beta1 treatment of HPV-positive raft epithelia led to a dose-dependent increase in E7 RNA expression in contrast to results from previous studies with monolayer cultures. Furthermore, TGF-beta1 interfered with the proliferation of HPV-positive cell lines grown in monolayer cultures. Our results suggest that loss of the ability to express markers of differentiation, a characteristic of malignancy, is a two-step process. The first step is reversible; the second is irreversible.
9603194	Evidence of type I and type II transforming growth factor-beta receptors in central nervous tissues: changes induced by focal cerebral ischemia.	The peptides of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family transduce their signal through ligand-induced heteromeric complexes that consist of type I and type II serine/threonine kinases. Both TGF-beta receptors are abundant in many peripheral tissues, but clear evidence of their expression in cortical astrocytes and neurons has not been published so far. In this study, we investigated the expression of type I and type II TGF-beta receptors and their potential ligands (TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, and TGF-beta3) in the CNS by using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Moreover, to further the study of those cell types that exhibit TGF-beta isoforms and related receptors, we examined through the use of RT-PCR whether cortical neurons and astrocytes in culture express the mRNAs for TGF-betas and their receptors. We show that the three TGF-beta isoform mRNAs are present in the CNS. However, although astrocytes in culture display all three isoforms, neurons in culture express only TGF-beta2. We have demonstrated that both type I and type II TGF-beta receptor mRNAs and proteins are present in the CNS and in cultures of cortical neurons and astrocytes. Thus, TGF-betas may act as autocrine and paracrine signals in the CNS between both neurons and astrocytes via the same receptor systems as those found in peripheral tissues. TGF-beta1 has been shown to be induced following hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of degenerative processes in the CNS. In the present investigation, we confirmed that the expression of TGF-beta1 was increased markedly up until 24 h and thereafter was stable over the first 3 days following permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in mice. However, whereas the expression of the type I TGF-beta receptor was not altered by the ischemic insult, the pattern of the type II TGF-beta receptors was modified dramatically in the ischemic area 3 days after the occlusion. These data show that, even if ligands are present, they may not be able to transduce their signal. Finally, the present study clearly demonstrates that a knowledge of the expression of ligand-specific receptors following brain injury is a fundamental step in clarifying the involvement of cytokines in neurodegenerative diseases.
9889140	Recent work on Alzheimer's disease transgenics.	The most significant feature of the current transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease continues to be the amyloid phenotype. In the past year, mice have been more extensively characterized in terms of the effect of amyloid accumulation on downstream events, such as neurodegeneration and behavioral changes, but the results have been complex. Genetic crosses have shown that apolipoprotein E and TGF-beta1 influence the deposition event and that the presenilins act synergistically with the amyloid precursor protein in pathology development. The mice have great utility in amyloid modulation studies but are still not complete models of Alzheimer's disease.
11245811	Beta-amyloid-induced glial expression of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in cerebral cortex of aged transgenic Tg2576 mice with Alzheimer plaque pathology.	To elucidate the mechanisms involved in beta-amyloid-mediated inflammation in Alzheimer's disease, transgenic Tg2576 mice containing as transgene the Swedish double mutation of human amyloid precursor protein 695, were examined for the expression pattern of various cytokines using double immunocytochemistry and laser scanning microscopy. Tg2576 mice studied at postnatal ages of 13, 16 and 19 months demonstrated an age-related accumulation of both senile and diffuse beta-amyloid plaques in neocortex and hippocampus. Reactive interleukin (IL)-1beta-immunoreactive astrocytes were found in close proximity to both fibrillary and diffuse beta-amyloid deposits detectable at very early stages of plaque development, while activated microglia appeared in and around fibrillary beta-amyloid plaques only. Subpopulations of reactive astrocytes also demonstrated immunolabeling for transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, TGF-beta3, and IL-10, already detectable in 13-month-old transgenic mouse brain, while a few IL-6-immunoreactive astrocytes were observed only at later stages of plaque development. The early beta-amyloid-mediated upregulation of IL-1beta, TGF-beta, and IL-10 in surrounding reactive astrocytes indicates the induction of both pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. The transgenic approach used in this study may thus provide a useful tool to further disclose the in vivo mechanisms by which pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines interact and/or contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
11311337	Sequence variation in the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFB1) gene and multiple sclerosis susceptibility.	Genome screenings in multiple sclerosis (MS) have identified multiple susceptibility regions supporting a polygenic model for this disease. Evidence for linkage was consistently observed at ch.19q13 suggesting the presence of an MS gene(s) in this region. Several interesting candidate genes are encoded within this region, including transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGFB1) and interleukin-11 (IL11). Both are multifunctional cytokines with significant and well-characterized immunomodulatory properties. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of common polymorphisms within the TGFB1 and IL11 loci and three closely flanking microsatellite markers (D19S421, CEA, D19S908) in 161 stringently ascertained and clinically characterized MS multiplex families using tests of both linkage (lod score, sib-pair analysis) and association (pedigree disequilibrium test or PDT). Patients and families were stratified by HLA-DR2 status to search for two-locus interactions. Suggestive evidence for linkage and association to CEA (lod score = 1.25, theta = 0.20, p = 0.015, respectively), located 0.4 cM from TGFB1, was observed in DR2 positive families only. Distinct clinical phenotypes were also examined and an association between a TGFB1 haplotype and a mild disease course was present (p = 0.008), raising the possibility that TGFB1 or a nearby locus may influence disease expression.
11942909	Transforming growth factor-beta 1 serum levels in pregnancy and pre-eclampsia.	BACKGROUND: Isoforms of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta1) are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. Data with respect to TGF-beta1 are controversial. We examined the correlation between TGF-beta1 serum levels and the occurrence and severity of pre-eclampsia. METHODS: Transforming growth factor-beta 1 serum levels were measured using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 44 women with pre-eclampsia and 44 healthy pregnant women. Results were correlated with clinical data. RESULTS: No difference in TGF-beta1 serum levels was assessed between women with pre-eclampsia and healthy pregnant women. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 serum levels were not associated with the severity of the disease and were not correlated with clinical maternal (blood pressure, proteinuria) and fetal (5-min APGAR score, umbilical cord pH values, birth weight) parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the assumption that in contrast to other isoforms, TGF-beta1, as evidenced by serum TGF-beta1 levels, does not seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia.
12082048	Association study of three polymorphisms of TGF-beta1 gene with Alzheimer's disease.	BACKGROUND: There is evidence that inflammatory processes may contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease through production of cytokines and free radicals that damage neurones. A recent study has shown that transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) signalling in astrocytes promotes Abeta production and could play a critical role in the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain. OBJECTIVES: To explore the impact of the -800 and -509 TGF-beta1 promoter polymorphisms and the +25 polymorphism on the risk of occurrence of Alzheimer's disease in a large population of sporadic cases and controls, and on the amyloid beta (Abeta) load in the brains of Alzheimer patients. METHODS: The TGF-beta1 genotypes of the three polymorphisms were determined in 678 sporadic Alzheimer's disease patients and 667 controls. They were also characterised, along with Abeta load, in the brains of 81 necropsy confirmed Alzheimer patients. RESULTS: No significant variations in the distribution of the genotypes and haplotypes were observed between Alzheimer patients and controls, or in the amount of Abeta deposition. CONCLUSIONS: These results do not suggest an influence of genetic variability at the TGF-beta1 gene locus on the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease.
12218417	Transforming growth factor-beta1-modulated cerebral gene expression.	Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) plays a central role in the response of the brain to different types of injury. Increased TGF-beta1 has been found in the central nervous system of patients with acute or chronic disorders such as stroke or Alzheimer disease. To further define the molecular targets of TGF-beta1 in cerebral tissues, a selection of high-density cDNA arrays was used to characterize the mRNA expression profile of 7,000 genes in transgenic mice overexpressing TGF-beta1 from astrocytes as compared with the wild-type line. Selected findings were further evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions from independent transgenic and wild-type mice. Furthermore, the expression pattern of seven selected genes such as Delta-1, CRADD, PRSC-1, PAI-1, Apo-1/Fas, CTS-B, and TbetaR-II were confirmed in either cultured cortical neurons or astrocytes following TGF-beta1 treatment. The authors' observations enlarge the repertoire of known TGF-beta1-modulated genes and their possible involvement in neurodegenerative processes.
12480736	Molecular and functional dissection of TGF-beta1-induced cerebrovascular abnormalities in transgenic mice.	Cerebrovascular abnormalities, such as reduced blood flow, microvascular fibrosis, and cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy, are prominent in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, their etiology is poorly understood and it is unclear whether cerebrovascular changes contribute to functional impairments in the absence of neurodegeneration. In humans with AD, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) mRNA levels in the midfrontal gyrus correlate positively with the relative degree of cerebrovascular amyloid deposition in that brain region, suggesting a possible role for TGF-beta1 in human cerebrovascular abnormalities. Transgenic mice overexpressing TGF-beta1 in astrocytes develop AD-like cerebrovascular abnormalities, including perivascular astrocytosis, microvascular basement membrane thickening, and accumulation of thioflavin S-positive amyloid in the absence of parenchymal degeneration. Mice overexpressing TGF-beta1 alone or in addition to human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) show selective accumulation of human beta-amyloid (Abeta) in blood vessels and develop cerebral hemorrhages in old age. In 9-month-old TGF-beta1 transgenic mice, cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the limbic system was significantly less than in nontransgenic littermate controls. Aged TGF-beta1 mice also showed overall reduced cerebral glucose uptake (CGU) as a measure of brain activity. Thus, chronic overproduction of TGF-beta1 in the brain results in structural and functional impairments reminiscent of those in AD cases with amyloid angiopathy.
12498970	TGFbeta1 enhances formation of cellular Abeta/apoE deposits in vascular myocytes.	Brain injury increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through unknown mechanisms. We studied deposition of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) in cells exposed to transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1), a cytokine that regulates cell metabolism during brain injury, and apolipoproteinE (apoE), the major lipid transporter in the brain. The studies were conducted by using brain vascular smooth muscle cells that are engaged in beta-amyloidosis in vivo and produce Abeta in cell culture. We found that cell treatment with TGFbeta1 together with apoE4 strongly increased the amount of cellular Abeta. The intracellular Abeta co-localized with apoE but not with TGFbeta, similarly as in vascular beta-amyloid. Some cellular Abeta/apoE deposits increased in size and persisted in culture even after the TGFbeta1 and apoE4 were removed. The appearance of cellular deposits of Abeta was associated with increased production of the amyloid-beta precursor protein and cellular retention of its mature form. The results suggest that the concomitant presence of apoE and TGFbeta1 can trigger vascular beta-amyloidosis by inducing intracellular formation of stable Abeta/apoE deposits.
9852574	Effects of transforming growth factor-beta (isoforms 1-3) on amyloid-beta deposition, inflammation, and cell targeting in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures.	The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family consists of three isoforms and is part of a larger family of cytokines regulating differentiation, development, and tissue repair. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that TGF-beta1 can increase amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) immunoreactive (Abetair) plaque-like deposits in rat brain. The aim of the current study was to evaluate all three isoforms of TGF-beta for their ability to affect the deposition and neurotoxicity of Abeta in an organotypic, hippocampal slice culture model of Abeta deposition. Slice cultures were treated with Abeta either with or without one of the TGF-beta isoforms. All three isoforms can increase Abeta accumulation (over Abeta treatment alone) within the slice culture, as determined by ELISA. However, there are striking differences in the pattern of Abetair among the three isoforms of TGF-beta. Isoforms 1 and 3 produced a cellular pattern of Abeta staining that colocalizes with GS lectin staining (microglia). TGF-beta2 produces dramatic Abeta staining of pyramidal neurons in layers CA1-CA2. In addition to cellular Abeta staining, plaque-like deposits are increased by all of the TGF-betas. Although no gross toxicity was observed, morphological neurodegenerative changes were seen in the CA1 region when the slices were treated with Abeta plus TGF-beta2. Our results demonstrate important functional differences among the TGF-beta isoforms in their ability to alter the cellular distribution and degradation of Abeta. These changes may be relevant to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
10233972	Microglial activation varies in different models of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.	Progressive changes in host mRNA expression can illuminate crucial pathogenetic pathways in infectious disease. We examined general and specific approaches to mRNA expression in three rodent models of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Each of these models displays distinctive neuropathology. Although mRNAs for the chemokine receptor CCR5, the lysosomal protease cathepsin S, and the pleiotropic cytokine transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) were progressively upregulated in rodent CJD, the temporal patterns and peak magnitudes of each of these transcripts varied substantially among models. Cathepsin S and TGF-beta1 were elevated more than 15-fold in mice and rats infected with two different CJD strains, but not in CJD-infected hamsters. In rats, an early activation of microglial transcripts preceded obvious deposits of prion protein (PrP) amyloid. However, in each of the three CJD models, the upregulation of CCR5, cathepsin S, and TGF-beta1 was variable with respect to the onset of PrP pathology. These results show glial cell involvement varies as a consequence of the agent strain and species infected. Although neurons are generally assumed to be the primary sites for agent replication and abnormal PrP formation, microglia may be targeted by some agent strains. In such instances, microglia can both process PrP to become amyloid and can enhance neuronal destruction. Because microglia can participate in agent clearance, they may also act as chronic reservoirs of infectivity. Finally, the results here strongly suggest that TGF-beta1 can be an essential signal for amyloid deposition.
10407185	TGF-beta(1), regulation of alzheimer amyloid precursor protein mRNA expression in a normal human astrocyte cell line: mRNA stabilization.	The transforming growth factor, TGF-beta(1), has been found to be increased in the central nervous system of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, elevates amyloid precursor protein (APP) mRNA levels in rat primary astrocytes, and may initiate or promote the deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in AD. Excess APP production in AD, which potentially leads to amyloidogenesis, is in part due to over expression of APP mRNA. The production of APP in a normal human cell line in contrast to transformed or animal cells provides a meaningful model to study the regulation of APP gene expression by cytokines that promotes amyloidogenesis. Here, we report that TGF-beta(1) treatment of human astrocytes markedly elevated APP mRNA levels, and also increased the half-life of APP message by at least five-fold. Under this condition, as detected by mobility shift and UV cross-linking analysis, a novel 68 kDa RNA-protein complex was formed, involving an 81 nucleotide (nt) fragment within the 3'-untranslated region (UTR), but not the 5'-UTR and coding region of APP mRNA. Insertion of the 3'-UTR onto the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) mRNA conferred TGF-beta(1) mediated mRNA stability in transfected human astrocytes. On the other hand, the same insert carrying a deletion of the APP mRNA cis-element fragment had no effect on CAT mRNA stability. A model of APP mRNA regulation is presented in which TGF-beta(1) induced stabilization of APP message involves the binding activity of a 68 kDa RNA-protein complex within the 3'-UTR, which is likely linked to a reduction in the rate of APP mRNA decay.
10652049	Transforming growth factor-beta is involved in the pathogenesis of dialysis-related amyloidosis.	BACKGROUND: Advanced glycation end product-modified beta2-microglobulin (AGE-beta2m) is an important component of dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA). Its presence induces monocyte chemotaxis and the release of the proinflammatory cytokines through macrophage activation. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional cytokine that also has chemotactic activity for monocytes at very low (0.1 to 10 pg/mL) concentrations and inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production of macrophages. In this study, we investigated the role of TGF-beta in the pathogenesis of DRA. METHODS: We performed an immunohistochemical study of DRA tissues (8 cases) to confirm the existence of TGF-betas and their receptors; we also performed a chemotaxis assay of human monocytes as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of TGF-beta1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) in the supernatant of human monocyte-derived macrophage cell culture under varying conditions of incubation with TGF-beta1, AGE-beta2m, and TGF-beta1 antibody additions. RESULTS: There was positive staining for TGF-betas (types 1, 2, and 3) and their receptors (types I, II, and III) in infiltrated macrophages (CD68+), synovial lining cell, as well as vascular walls around amyloid deposition. AGE-beta2m also induced TGF-beta1 production by macrophages in a dose-dependent manner (410 +/- 80 pg/mL at 12.5 microg/mL, 621 +/- 62 pg/mL at 25 microg/mL, and 776 +/- 62 pg/mL at 50 microg/mL of AGE-beta2m). AGE-beta2m induced significant TNF-alpha and IL-1Ra production by macrophage. The addition of exogenous TGF-beta1 (0.1 to 10 ng/mL) decreased AGE-beta2m-induced TNF-alpha production and increased IL-1Ra production in a dose-dependent fashion. IL-1beta production was not effected by any experimental conditions. In chemotaxis assay, anti-TGF-beta1 antibody (0.1 to 10 microg/mL) attenuated AGE-beta2m-induced monocyte chemotaxis. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence to our knowledge for the presence of TGF-beta in DRA tissue, as well as the stimulatory action of AGE-beta2m on tissue macrophages. In turn, TGF-beta suppresses the proinflammatory activation of macrophages, suggesting a dual role for TGF-beta in the inflammatory process of DRA. These observations may provide a pathophysiologic link between TGF-beta and DRA.
11074155	Transforming growth factor-beta1 induces transforming growth factor-beta1 and transforming growth factor-beta receptor messenger RNAs and reduces complement C1qB messenger RNA in rat brain microglia.	Transforming growth factor-beta1 is a multifunctional peptide with increased expression during Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions which involve inflammatory mechanisms. We examined the autoregulation of transforming growth factor-beta1 and transforming growth factor-beta receptors and the effects of transforming growth factor-beta1 on complement C1q in brains of adult Fischer 344 male rats and in primary glial cultures. Perforant path transection by entorhinal cortex lesioning was used as a model for the hippocampal deafferentation of Alzheimer's disease. In the hippocampus ipsilateral to the lesion, transforming growth factor-beta1 peptide was increased >100-fold; the messenger RNAs encoding transforming growth factor-beta1, transforming growth factor-beta type I and type II receptors were also increased, but to a smaller degree. In this acute lesion paradigm, microglia are the main cell type containing transforming growth factor-beta1, transforming growth factor-beta type I and II receptor messenger RNAs, shown by immunocytochemistry in combination with in situ hybridization. Autoregulation of the transforming growth factor-beta1 system was examined by intraventricular infusion of transforming growth factor-beta1 peptide, which increased hippocampal transforming growth factor-beta1 messenger RNA levels in a dose-dependent fashion. Similarly, transforming growth factor-beta1 increased levels of transforming growth factor-beta1 messenger RNA and transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor messenger RNA (IC(50), 5pM) and increased release of transforming growth factor-beta1 peptide from primary microglia cultures. Interactions of transforming growth factor-beta1 with complement system gene expression are also indicated, because transforming growth factor-beta1 decreased C1qB messenger RNA in the cortex and hippocampus, after intraventricular infusion, and in cultured glia. These indications of autocrine regulation of transforming growth factor-beta1 in the rodent brain support a major role of microglia in neural activities of transforming growth factor-beta1 and give a new link between transforming growth factor-beta1 and the complement system. The auto-induction of the transforming growth factor-beta1 system has implications for transgenic mice that overexpress transforming growth factor-beta1 in brain cells and for its potential role in amyloidogenesis.
11329064	TGF-beta1 promotes microglial amyloid-beta clearance and reduces plaque burden in transgenic mice.	Abnormal accumulation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in the brain appears crucial to pathogenesis in all forms of Alzheimer disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms in the sporadic forms of AD remain unknown. Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), a key regulator of the brain's responses to injury and inflammation, has been implicated in Abeta deposition in vivo. Here we demonstrate that a modest increase in astroglial TGF-beta1 production in aged transgenic mice expressing the human beta-amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) results in a three-fold reduction in the number of parenchymal amyloid plaques, a 50% reduction in the overall Abeta load in the hippocampus and neocortex, and a decrease in the number of dystrophic neurites. In mice expressing hAPP and TGF-beta1, Abeta accumulated substantially in cerebral blood vessels, but not in parenchymal plaques. In human cases of AD, Abeta immunoreactivity associated with parenchymal plaques was inversely correlated with Abeta in blood vessels and cortical TGF-beta1 mRNA levels. The reduction of parenchymal plaques in hAPP/TGF-beta1 mice was associated with a strong activation of microglia and an increase in inflammatory mediators. Recombinant TGF-beta1 stimulated Abeta clearance in microglial cell cultures. These results demonstrate that TGF-beta1 is an important modifier of amyloid deposition in vivo and indicate that TGF-beta1 might promote microglial processes that inhibit the accumulation of Abeta in the brain parenchyma.
11803678	ERP response decrement and recovery as a function of stimulus type and scalp location.	Response decrement and recovery of visual event-related potentials (ERPs) at different electrode sites to different types of repetitive stimuli were studied. Nine blocks of stimuli were presented in the form AAAAAABB. Stimuli were of four types: diffuse flashes of light, geometric shapes, words of similar meanings, and words of dissimilar meanings. The relative amounts of ERP response decrement and recovery differed as a function of ERP response components measured (early vs. late), electrode site (left frontal, left temporoparietal, and left occipital), and stimulus type. Early components were sensitive to sensory characteristics of the stimuli. Late components from the left temporoparietal site were sensitive to the meanings of the linguistic stimuli. The research suggests a useful paradigm for the study of habituation-like responses and of cerebral specificity in an intact normal population.
11906979	Preferences for gender of family physician among Canadian European-descent and South-Asian immigrant women.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate expressed preferences for family physician (FP) gender among Canadian European-descent (CED) and Canadian South-Asian (CSA) immigrant women. METHOD: An 'on-site' survey was conducted in community-based institutions in Toronto in order to determine preferences for the gender of FP under various health care scenarios: overall health care; gender-sensitive examinations; emotional problems; general ailments; and life-threatening conditions. RESULTS: Ninety-four women responded to this survey (CED = 50, CSA = 44), response rate 77.3%. For all health care scenarios, CED and CSA women similarly expressed either a preference for a female FP or no preference. More than two-thirds of women preferred a female FP for gynaecological examinations (CED, 72.9%; CSA, 83.7%) or examinations with private body part exposure (CED, 72%; CSA, 81.8%). For 'emotional problems', half of the women preferred a female FP and the other half had no preference. A similar pattern was observed for 'overall health care', with some shift to female physician preference among CSA women (60.5%) compared with CED women (53.2%). For the 'overall health care' scenario, CED and CSA women who preferred a female FP had a higher frequency of seeing female physicians within the last 5 years (CED, P < or = 0.01; CSA, P < or = 0.05), and attributed 'positive' social skills more to female physicians (CED, P < or = 0.01; CSA, P < or = 0.01) compared with women with no preference for the gender of the FP. Yet, CED women with a female FP preference were more likely to have a concurrent female FP (P < or = 0.01), and to rate past experiences with female physicians as high (P < or = 0.01) and with male physicians as low (P < or = 0.05) compared with CED women with no preference. In the CSA group, women with a preference for a female FP were more likely to be unemployed (P < or = 0.01) and have low social support (P < or = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar physician gender preference patterns, factors associated with these preferences show some differences between CED and CSA women.
12175481	Decrease of TGF-beta1 plasma levels and increase of nitric oxide synthase activity in leukocytes as potential biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.	A variety of inflammatory proteins have been identified in brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, including inflammatory cytokines, acute phase proteins and complement components. In the present paper we have investigated the levels of circulating inflammatory mediators as potential biomarkers of this disease, concentrating mostly on transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta1) in plasma and on nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in leukocytes. Plasma and leukocytes were isolated from 48 sporadic AD and 23 healthy control subjects of same age and sex. Since alpha2-Macroglobulin (alpha2M), an acute phase protein possibly involved in AD, is an important modulator of TGF-beta1 activity, binding and targeting this cytokine to its appropriate site of action, we have investigated the possible complex between TGF-beta1 and alpha2M in plasma of the same subjects. The results demonstrate a significant reduction of TGF-beta1 levels in plasma of AD patients. A complex between alpha2M and TGF-beta1 occurred in AD as well as healthy elderly control subjects, however, with no significant differences. Moreover, alpha2M appeared to bind only the inactive form of this cytokine. In contrast, NOS activity increased significantly in leukocytes of AD patients. Therefore, we suggest the combined determination of TGF-beta1 in the plasma and of NOS activity in the leukocytes as biomarkers of AD.
12428741	Gene transfection and expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 in nonobese diabetic mouse islets protects beta-cells in syngeneic islet grafts from autoimmune destruction.	Nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice develop diabetes and destroy syngeneic islet grafts through an autoimmune response. Because transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 downregulates immune responses, we tested whether overexpression of TGF-beta1 by gene transfection of NOD mouse islets could protect beta-cells in islet grafts from autoimmune destruction. NOD mouse islet cells were transfected with an adenoviral DNA expression vector encoding porcine latent TGF-beta1 (Ad TGF-beta1) or the adenoviral vector alone (control Ad vector). The frequency of total islet cells expressing TGF-beta1 protein was increased from 12 +/- 1% in control Ad vector-transfected cells to 89 +/- 4% in Ad TGF-beta1-transfected islet cells, and the frequency of beta-cells that expressed TGF-beta1 was increased from 12 +/- 1% to 60 +/- 7%. Also, secretion of TGF-beta1 was significantly increased in islets that overexpressed TGF-beta1. Ad TGF-beta1-transfected NOD mouse islets that overexpressed TGF-beta1 prevented diabetes recurrence after transplantation into diabetic NOD mice for a median of 22 days compared with only 7 days for control Ad vector-transfected islets (p = 0.001). Immunohistochemical examination of the islet grafts revealed significantly more TGF-beta1+ cells and insulin+ cells and significantly fewer CD45+ leukocytes in Ad TGF-beta1-transfected islet grafts. Also, islet beta-cell apoptosis was significantly decreased whereas apoptosis of graft-infiltrating leukocytes was significantly increased in Ad TGF-beta1-transfected islet grafts. These observations demonstrate that overexpression of TGF-beta1, by gene transfection of NOD mouse islets, protects islet beta-cells from apoptosis and autoimmune destruction and delays diabetes recurrence after islet transplantation.
12655298	Caspase-2 redux.	It has been difficult to assign caspase-2 to the effector or initiator caspase groups. It bears sequence homology to initiators (caspase-9 and CED-3), but its cleavage specificity is closer to the effectors (caspase-3 and -7). Interest in caspase-2 was dampened by the lack of a dramatic phenotype in the caspase-2 null mouse. Studies have been inhibited by the lack of knowledge about its mechanism of activation and the lack of specific methods to assay its activity. Molecular studies have defined a unique role for caspase-2 in apoptosis initiated by beta-amyloid toxicity or by trophic factor deprivation. Recently, a role for caspase-2 as an upstream initiator of mitochondrial permeabilization has been proposed. Thus, while much remains to be deciphered about caspase-2, most critically the mode of activation, it is clear that caspase-2 plays critical and singular roles in the control of programmed cell death.
12759250	Gelatinase A (MMP-2) is necessary and sufficient for renal tubular cell epithelial-mesenchymal transformation.	Progressive renal interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy represent the final injury pathway for all commonly encountered forms of renal disease that lead to end-stage renal failure. It has been recently recognized that myofibroblastic cells are the major contributors to the deposition of interstitial collagens. While there are several potential cellular sources of myofibroblasts, attention has focused on the transformation of the organized tubular epithelium to the myofibroblastic phenotype, a process potently driven both in vitro and in vivo by transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). Integrity of the underlying basal lamina provides cellular signals that maintain the epithelial phenotype, and disruption by discrete proteases could potentially initiate the transformation process. We demonstrate that TGF-beta1 coordinately stimulates the synthesis of a specific matrix metalloproteinase, gelatinase A (MMP-2), and its activator protease, MT1-MMP (MMP-14), and that active gelatinase A is absolutely required for epithelial-mesenchymal transformation induced by TGF-beta1. In addition, purified active gelatinase A alone is sufficient to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transformation in the absence of exogenous TGF-beta1. Gelatinase A may also mediate epithelial-mesenchymal transformation in a paracrine manner through the proteolytic generation of active TGF-beta1 peptide. MT1-MMP and gelatinase A were co-localized to sites of active epithelial-mesenchymal transformation and basal lamina disruption in the rat remnant kidney model of progressive renal fibrosis. These studies indicate that a discrete matrix metalloproteinase, gelatinase A, is capable of inducing the complex genetic rearrangements that characterize renal tubular epithelial-mesenchymal transformation.
7654074	Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 and cerebral hemorrhage associated with amyloid angiopathy.	Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is characterized by cerebrovascular deposition of the amyloid beta-peptide, leading to intracerebral hemorrhage in severe cases. Other than rare familial cases, the only identified risks for CAA are advancing age and accompanying Alzheimer's disease. We tested whether the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (apoE epsilon 4) allele was associated with CAA and hemorrhage and whether this association was independent of Alzheimer's disease. The apoE epsilon 4 genotype was determined without knowledge of the pathology for 93 postmortem cases systematically graded for severity of CAA and for 15 patients with CAA-associated intracerebral hemorrhage. We found a significant and independent effect of the apoE genotype in both cohorts. Among the postmortem cases, the presence of apoE epsilon 4 increased the odds ratio for moderate or severe CAA by 2.9-fold, relative to cases without epsilon 4; two copies of epsilon 4 increased the odds ratio 13.1-fold. In the cohort of CAA-associated cerebral hemorrhages, the apoE epsilon 4 allele frequency was 0.40, significantly greater than the control frequency of 0.14. The increase in CAA remained even after controlling for the presence of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that apoE epsilon 4 is a risk factor for CAA and CAA-related hemorrhage, independent of its association with Alzheimer's disease.
10063714	Intracerebral hemorrhage caused by cerebral amyloid angiopathy: a case report.	Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) accounts for approximately 10% of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH), and typically occurs in the cortex and subcortical white matter. It is characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils in the leptomeningeal, cortical and subcortical arteries. Pathologically, amyloid is stained pink with Congo red and shows yellow-green birefringence when viewed under polarized light. Although there have been many reports of CAA in the literature, it has rarely been described in Taiwan. This is the report of a case of a 75-year-old man with ICH caused by CAA. The postoperative course was uneventful. The incidence of this disease increases with age. The authors, therefore, suggest conducting a brain biopsy and special stain for CAA in each operative case of spontaneous ICH, especially in the elderly.
10437719	Determination of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, interleukin-10, and transforming growth factor-beta1 in synovial fluid aspirates of patients with temporomandibular disorders.	PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to examine the presence of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), IL-10, and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in the synovial fluid (SF) lavage specimens of patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Synovial fluid lavage specimens were obtained from 14 temporomandibular joints (TMJs) of 12 patients with TMJ internal derangement (ID) and 17 TMJs of 15 patients with TMJ osteoarthritis (OA). Seven synovial fluid lavage samples of TMJs of four asymptomatic donors served as normal controls. The concentrations of IL-1ra, IL-10, and TGF-beta1 were detected with sensitive and specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (sandwich-ELISA). RESULTS: IL-1ra, IL-10, and TGF-beta1 in all the normal controls were undetectable. IL-1ra concentrations were 175.78 +/- 52.43 pg/mL in the patients with TMJ ID and 187.85 +/- 59.51 pg/mL in those with TMJ OA. IL-10 was undetectable in all the TMJ ID and OA samples. The concentration of TGF-beta1 in TMJ ID patients (47.93 +/- 88.25 pg/mL) was significantly less than in patients with TMJ OA (143.61 +/- 108.00 pg/mL) (P < .01). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that deficiencies of IL-1ra, IL-10, and TGF-beta1 probably play an important role in the cause and pathogenesis of TMJ ID and OA.
10818521	Alzheimer's disease-like cerebrovascular pathology in transforming growth factor-beta 1 transgenic mice and functional metabolic correlates.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is frequently associated with cerebrovascular changes, including perivascular astrocytosis, amyloid deposition, and microvascular degeneration, but it is not known whether these pathological changes contribute to functional deficits in AD. To characterize the temporal relationship between amyloid deposition, cerebrovascular abnormalities, and potential functional changes, we studied transgenic mice that express transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) at low levels in astrocytes. TGF-beta 1 induced a prominent perivascular astrocytosis, followed by the accumulation of basement membrane proteins in microvessels, thickening of capillary basement membranes, and later, around 6 months of age, deposition of amyloid in cerebral blood vessels. At 9 months of age, various AD-like degenerative alterations were observed in endothelial cells and pericytes. Associated with these morphological changes were changes in regional cerebral glucose utilization. Preliminary results showed that TGF-beta 1 mice had significantly decreased glucose utilization in the mammillary bodies, structures involved in mnemonic and learning processes. Glucose utilization tended to be decreased in several other brain regions as well; however, in the inferior colliculus, it was markedly higher in TGF-beta 1 mice than in controls. We conclude that chronic overproduction of TGF-beta 1 triggers a pathogenic cascade leading to AD-like cerebrovascular amyloidosis, microvascular degeneration, and local alterations in brain metabolic activity. Similar mechanisms may be involved in AD pathogenesis.
11578774	Functional role of TGF beta in Alzheimer's disease microvascular injury: lessons from transgenic mice.	Recent studies have implicated pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines as integral to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Among them, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is emerging as an important factor in regulating inflammatory responses. This multifunctional cytokine might be centrally involved in several aspects of AD pathogenesis by regulating beta-amyloid precursor protein synthesis and processing, plaque formation, astroglial and microglial response and neuronal cell death. Among all of these potential roles, studies in transgenic and infusion animal models have shown that TGF-beta may primarily contribute to AD pathogenesis by influencing A beta production and deposition, which in turn might result in damage to the brain microvasculature. The lessons learned from these models are of great interest not only for understanding of the role of TGF-beta in AD, but also for future treatments where testing of anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen and an amyloid vaccine hold great promise. In this regard, further elucidation of the signal pathways by which TGF-beta exerts its effect in AD might lead to specific targets for further therapeutic intervention.
11799686	Metabolic sources of heat and power in tuna muscles. I. Muscle fine structure.	As part of an investigation into the generation of muscle heat in the tuna, the histochemistry and ultrastructure of the myotomal muscles were studied. Both red and white fibres are differentiated into two forms. The two forms of red muscle are very similar except for differential electron absorbance and different kinds of glycogen granules stored. In both forms, capillarity, mitochondrial numbers, and intracellular lipid droplets are abundant, implying the potential for a vigorous aerobic metabolism. During bursts of swimming, glycogen granules and intracellular lipid droplets are both largely depleted. The two types of white fibre differ in electron absorbance, pinocyotic activity, glycogen abundance, and insertion pattern, all of which are more pronounced in the 'dense' fibre form. Several features of tuna white muscle are unique or unusually developed. Thus, tuna muscle contains more glycogen than does red muscle. Glycogen granules may be randomly dispersed in myofibrillar or peripheral regions or may be sequestered in membrane-bound structures termed glycogen bodies. During short bursts of swimming, glycogen granules from all storage sites are mobilized. The white muscle has an ample capillary supply, small, but significant, amounts of intracellular lipid, and unusual numbers of mitochondria.
12055102	TIMAP, a novel CAAX box protein regulated by TGF-beta1 and expressed in endothelial cells.	Representational difference analysis of the glomerular endothelial cell response to transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) revealed a novel gene, TIMAP (TGF-beta-inhibited membrane-associated protein), which contains 10 exons and maps to human chromosome 20.q11.22. By Northern blot, TIMAP mRNA is highly expressed in all cultured endothelial and hematopoietic cells. The frequency of the TIMAP SAGE tag is much greater in endothelial cell SAGE databases than in nonendothelial cells. Immunofluorescence studies of rat tissues show that anti-TIMAP antibodies localize to vascular endothelium. TGF-beta1 represses TIMAP through a protein synthesis- and histone deacetylase-dependent process. The TIMAP protein contains five ankyrin repeats, a protein phosphatase-1 (PP1)-interacting domain, a COOH-terminal CAAX box, a domain arrangement similar to that of MYPT3, and a PP1 inhibitor. A green fluorescent protein-TIMAP fusion protein localized to the plasma membrane in a CAAX box-dependent fashion. Hence, TIMAP is a novel gene highly expressed in endothelial and hematopoietic cells and regulated by TGF-beta1. On the basis of its domain structure, TIMAP may serve a signaling function, potentially through interaction with PP1.
12719626	Role of cytokines in the gene expression of amyloid beta-protein precursor: identification of a 5'-UTR-binding nuclear factor and its implications in Alzheimer's disease.	One of the major neuropathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the brain depositions of senile plaques that are mainly composed of toxic amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), which is generated from a family of Abeta containing precursor proteins (AbetaPP; 695-770 amino acids). The role of cytokines and growth factors has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Our goal is to determine the mode of action of cytokines on the regulation of betaPP gene expression. Here we studied the effect of different cytokines on the activity of 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of betaPP mRNA in human astrocytic cells (U-373). We compared betaPP-5'-UTR activity in the presence of interleukin-1 (IL-1alpha and IL-1beta), transforming growth factor (TGF-beta1) and tumor necrosis factor TNF-alpha1. The astrocytic cells, which were treated separately with these agents, were transfected with either the vector (pSV2CAT) or pSV2UTR-CAT construct containing 90 bp of AbetaPP 5'-UTR +54 to 144 bp). This region was cloned upstream of a reporter chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene (CAT). Our results indicate that the treatment of pSV2UTR-CAT-transfected cells with either IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, TGF-beta1 or TNF-alpha1 stimulated reporter gene activity in a factor-specific manner. This was consistent with their effects on elevating AbetaPP protein levels. Transfection of the same cells with the pSV2CAT vector lacking 5'-UTR resulted in a reduced reporter gene activity with all treatments studied. DNA-gel shift experiments indicate that the 54/144 region binds to a nuclear protein(s) in a cell type specific manner. These results suggest that 5'-UTR of the AbetaPP gene can respond to the stimulation of different cytokines, which likely regulate AbetaPP transcription and translation via regulatory elements present in the AbetaPP promoter and in 5'-UTR, respectively. The characterization of AbetaPP regulatory elements, including the 5'-UTR, will accelerate the development of novel agents against new targets for AD.
8023372	Contralateral conjugate eye deviation in acute supratentorial lesions.	BACKGROUND: Conjugate eye deviation (CED) in patients with acute supratentorial lesions is generally directed ipsilateral to the lesioned hemisphere. Incidentally, CED occurs to the contralateral side. We report five new cases and review previously published reports to elucidate the lesion responsible for and the mechanism underlying this phenomenon. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: In a prospective study of 133 consecutive patients with CED caused by an acute supratentorial lesion, 5 patients showed contralateral CED. This was caused by an intracerebral hemorrhage located thalamic (n = 2), frontoparietal (n = 1), and frontoparietotemporal (n = 1). In 1 patient the cause was a subdural hematoma, an association that has not been reported earlier. Four of the 5 patients died. All patients had clinical signs of rostral brain stem dysfunction and a shift of midline structures on computed tomographic scan or at autopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Contralateral CED is always associated with hemorrhagic lesions, most commonly in the thalamus. The prognosis of patients with this sign is generally poor. Involvement of descending oculomotor pathways from the contralateral hemisphere at midbrain level is the most probable explanation for this phenomenon.
9295214	Characterization of amyloid beta protein species in cerebral amyloid angiopathy of a squirrel monkey by immunocytochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.	We analyzed the composition of amyloid beta protein (A beta) species in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) of an aged squirrel monkey. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that the cerebral cortex contained no lesions other than widespread CAA with A beta40 as its apparent major component. However, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that A beta42(43) predominated over A beta40 in a formic acid-extracted cortical fraction. These findings suggest possible underestimation of A beta42(43) levels in some previous immunocytochemical investigations.
9729521	Regulation of human mesangial cell collagen expression by transforming growth factor-beta1.	Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 has been implicated in glomerular extracellular matrix accumulation. Since the spectrum and mechanism of changes in collagen turnover have not been fully characterized, we evaluated effects of TGF-beta1 on collagen expression by human mesangial cells. TGF-beta1 induced increased alpha1(I), alpha1(III), and alpha1(IV) collagen mRNA expression. Greater mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 was compensated by increased tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-2 mRNA. There was no change in TIMP-1 or membrane-type MMP mRNA expression, whereas MMP-1 mRNA decreased. Types I and IV collagen protein accumulated in both the cell layer and medium. Changes in collagen mRNA and protein occurred within 4 and 8 h, respectively. MMP-2 and TIMP-1 and -2 activities showed little change. Cycloheximide markedly decreased collagen detection within 4 h and reversed late, but not early, changes in alpha1(I) collagen mRNA. In this system, increased synthesis may be more significant than degradation for collagen accumulation, but collagen is short-lived in culture. Diverse TGF-beta1 actions on collagen turnover may be either immediate or mediated through synthesis of regulatory molecules.
9848098	Flemish and Dutch mutations in amyloid beta precursor protein have different effects on amyloid beta secretion.	Mutations in the amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) gene cosegregate with autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (AD). Brain pathology of AD is characterized by amyloid deposition in senile plaques and by neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid deposits in AD brains consist of amyloid beta (A beta), a 4-kDa proteolytic product of APP. In contrast, two other mutations in APP, the Flemish APP692 and Dutch APP693 mutations, are associated with autosomal dominant cerebral hemorrhages due to congophilic amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in the presence or absence of AD pathology, respectively. Both mutations are located within A beta near the constitutive cleavage site. While a common effect of AD-linked mutations is to elevate A beta 42 extracellular concentrations, not much is known about the effect of APP692 and APP693. Here we provide evidence that APP692 and APP693 have a different effect on A beta secretion as determined by cDNA transfection experiments. While APP692 upregulates both A beta 40 and A beta 42 secretion, APP693 does not. These data corroborate with previous findings that increased A beta secretion and particularly of A beta 42, is specific for AD pathology.
10491283	Induction of the alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin gene in the brain associated with TGF-beta1 deficiency or systemic administration of endotoxin.	We report that mRNA levels for alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin (ACT), a component of beta-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease, are significantly increased in the brains of two different mouse models that develop inflammation: (1) acute inflammation caused by intraperitoneal injection with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and (2) chronic inflammation in knockout mice lacking the anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1). While brain mRNA levels for the inflammatory cytokines TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 were all elevated in the LPS-injected mice, only the mRNA for IL-1beta increased significantly in TGF-beta1-deficient mice. The transcription factor C/EBPbeta was strongly activated in the brains of both models. These results support the hypothesis that, through induction of the ACT gene in the brain, inflammation plays an important role during the development of Alzheimer's disease and that IL-1beta and C/EBPbeta may be involved in this process.
10644793	Novel presenilin-1 mutation with widespread cortical amyloid deposition but limited cerebral amyloid angiopathy.	OBJECTIVE: To clarify the phenotypic heterogeneity in deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the parenchyma and in cerebral vessels of the brains of the patients having presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations. Mutations in PS1 induce increased production of Abeta42(43), resulting in an enhanced overall deposition of Abeta protein within the cerebral cortex. METHODS: Sequence analysis of the PS1 gene of DNA from patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease, and immunostaining of brain tissues by end specific monoclonal antibodies against Abeta. RESULTS: Sequence analysis disclosed a novel mutation (N405S) in the PS1 gene in a Japanese patient with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Postmortem examination of one patient with N405S showed limited cerebral amyloid angiopathy, whereas postmortem examination of another Japanese patient with Alzheimer's disease with the E184D mutation disclosed severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The brains of both patients showed widespread neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. Immunostaining showed that Abeta42 was predominant over Abeta40 in neuritic plaques in both patients, whereas Abeta40 was found to be predominant over Abeta42 in cerebral amyloid angiopathy in the patient with E184D. However, most cortical vessels of the patient with N405S were not reactive with either of the antibodies. CONCLUSION: The N405S mutation of PS1 is a major determinant of cortical Abeta deposition but not cerebral amyloid angiopathy in Alzheimer's disease.
10723086	Transforming growth factor-beta1 expression in cultured corneal fibroblasts in response to injury.	The mechanisms underlying TGF-beta regulation in response to injury are not fully understood. We have developed an in vitro wound model to evaluate the expression and localization of transforming growth factor-beta1 in rabbit corneal fibroblasts in response to injury. Experiments were conducted in the presence or absence of serum so that the effect of the injury could be distinguished from exogenous wound mediators. Cultures were wounded and evaluations conducted over a number of time points. Expression of TGF-beta1 RNA was determined using Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization, while the TGF-beta receptors were identified by affinity cross-linking. Injury increased the expression of TGF-beta1 mRNA in cells at the wound edge after 30 min; this response was amplified by the addition of serum. TGF-beta1 mRNA expression was observed in a number of cells distal from the wound. After wound closure, TGF-beta1 mRNA was negligible and resembled unwounded cultures. The half-life of TGF-beta1 mRNA was two times greater in the wounded cultures, indicating that the injury itself maintained the expression, while cell migration was present. Analogous to these findings, we found that binding of TGF-beta to its receptors was maximal at the wound edge, decreasing with time and distance from the wound. These results indicate that injury increases the level of expression of TGF-beta1 mRNA and maintains a higher level of receptor binding during events in wound repair and that these might facilitate the migratory and synthetic response of stromal fibroblasts.
11123210	Effects of fibrogenic mediators on the development of pancreatic fibrosis in a TGF-beta1 transgenic mouse model.	The pancreas morphology of transgenic mice that overexpress transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in the pancreas resembles partially morphological features of chronic pancreatitis, such as progressive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). Using this transgenic mouse model, we characterized the composition of pancreatic fibrosis and involved fibrogenic mediators. On day 14 after birth, fibrotic tissue was mainly composed of collagen type I and III. At this time, mRNA levels of TGF-beta1 were increased. On day 70, the ECM composition was expanded by increased deposition of fibronectin, whereas connective tissue growth factor, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1, and FGF-2 mRNA expression levels were elevated in addition to TGF-beta1. In parallel, the number of pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) increased over time. In vitro, TGF-beta1 stimulated collagen type I expression but not fibronectin expression in PSC, in contrast to FGF-2, which stimulated both. This confirms that TGF-beta1 mediates pancreatic fibrosis through activation of PSC and deposition of collagen type I and III at early time points. Furthermore, this points to an indirect mechanism in which TGF-beta regulates pancreatic ECM assembly by induction of additional growth factors.
8662974	Transcriptional regulation of the human biglycan gene.	The small leucine-rich proteoglycan biglycan is involved in several physiological and pathophysiological processes through the ability of its core protein to interact with other extracellular matrix molecules and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). To learn more about the regulation of biglycan core protein expression, we have cloned and sequenced 1218 base pairs from the 5'-flanking region of the human biglycan gene, demonstrated functional promoter activity, and investigated the molecular mechanisms through which various agents modulate its transcriptional activity. Sequencing revealed the presence of several cis-acting elements including multiple AP-2 sites and interleukin-6 response elements, a NF-kappaB site, a TGF-beta negative element, and an E-box. The TATA and CAAT box-lacking promoter possesses many features of a growth-related gene, e.g. a GC-rich immediate 5' region, many Sp1 sites, and the use of multiple transcriptional start sites. Transient transfections of the tumor cell lines MG-63, SK-UT-1, and T47D with various biglycan 5'-flanking region-luciferase reporter gene constructs showed that the proximal 78 base pairs are sufficient for full promoter activity. Several agents among them interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. were capable of altering biglycan promoter activity. However, in MG-63 cells, TGF-beta1 failed to increase either activity of the biglycan promoter constructs or specific transcription from the endogenous biglycan gene. Since TGF-beta1 also did not alter the stability of cytoplasmic biglycan mRNA as determined from Northern analysis after inhibition of transcription with 5,6-dichloro-1beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, an as yet unidentified nuclear post-transcriptional mechanism was considered responsible for the TGF-beta effect in this cell type. These results might help to elucidate the molecular pathways leading to pathological alterations of biglycan expression observed in atherosclerosis, glomerulonephritis, and fibrosis.
9237543	Factors produced by activated macrophages reduce accumulation of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid protein in vascular smooth muscle cells.	Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) isolated from amyloid-angiopathy affected brain vessels accumulate intracellularly amyloid-beta peptide (A beta). Now we demonstrate that accumulation of A beta in SMCs can be reduced by factors secreted by macrophages - IL-1alpha, IL-6, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta1 or PGE2 - probably by stimulating the non-amyloidogenic processing of A beta precursor protein (PP). It is suggested that brain macrophages may regulate A betaPP/A beta metabolism under physiological conditions and prevent beta-amyloidosis. The disturbance of this regulatory function of brain macrophages may result in excessive production and accumulation of A beta.
11799678	The effect of air resistance on the jumping performance of insects.	A spring gun was constructed to propel objects at known velocities of between 1 and 4.5 m.s-1. This was used to project insects and various models in a vertical trajectory. By comparing the height attained in air by the insects or models with the height theoretically possible in vacuo, the energy lost against air resistance was observed. Small insects have a higher frontal area to mass ratio than larger ones so have relatively more aerodynamic drag and attain lower heights. The observed effect may be expressed in terms of the drag coefficient, CD. Fleas and locusts have CD of about 1. Winged flies have CD of about 1.5 which falls to about 1 when the wings are amputated and to about 0.8 when the legs are amputated. Aptery is advantageous in jumping insects. From experiments with models, it appears that the optimal condition for small jumping insects is that the body should be as compact as possible to reduce the frontal area to mass ratio. Thus dense spherical bodies are favoured. Some species of jumping insect have densities of about 1 mg.mm-3 while some flying beetles and flies have densities between 0.3 and 0.8 mg.mm-3. The Reynolds number at which the experiments were performed was from 65-205 for fleas up to 740-2340 for locusts. The models operated in similar ranges. At a velocity which would propel a larger animal to a height of 1 m, fleas weighing 0.4 mg only reach about 0.4 m. At lower initial velocities, proportionately less energy is wasted against air resistance so the jump efficiency is higher. Most fleas jump to a height of about 0.1 m with an efficiency of 0.8 while locusts jump to a height of 0.35 m with an efficiency of over 0.9. Air resistance is thus an important scale effect in jumping insects and provides its own design constraints.
9112364	In vivo hyperexpression of transforming growth factor-beta1 in mice: stimulation by cyclosporine.	BACKGROUND: We have demonstrated that cyclosporine (CsA) stimulates transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1 expression in vitro and that growth of mammalian cells can be arrested by CsA via a TGF-beta1-dependent mechanism. Herein, we have explored whether CsA stimulates TGF-beta1 hyperexpression in vivo. METHODS: Four groups of B6AF1 mice were studied: group 1, control; group 2, CsA pretreatment; group 3, anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody pretreatment; and group 4, CsA plus anti-CD3 pretreatment. RESULTS: CsA pretreatment augmented TGF-beta1 protein expression and increased intrarenal display of TGF-beta1 mRNA. This heightened TGF-beta1 expression was associated with an impaired T cell proliferative response. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations, together, advance the hypothesis that CsA might function in vivo as an immunosuppressant not only by inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin 2), but also by stimulating the expression of TGF-beta1, a potent immunosuppressive cytokine. Moreover, prevention of TGF-beta1 hyperexpression might prevent CsA-associated renal fibrosis, as TGF-beta1 is a fibrogenic cytokine.
9375822	Glomerular transforming growth factor-beta1 mRNA as a marker of glomerulosclerosis-application in renal biopsies.	As transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is implicated in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis, the aim of the study was to demonstrate if levels of glomerular TGF-beta1 mRNA in renal biopsies correlated with glomerulosclerosis. Glomeruli were collected by microdissection from renal biopsies in patients with membranous nephropathy, lupus nephritis, diabetic nephropathy, minimal change disease and IgA nephropathy presented by proteinuria when serum creatinine was <3 mg%. Glomerular mRNAs were reverse transcribed and TGF-beta1, alpha2(IV) collagen, beta-actin cDNA quantitated by competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR). By semiquantitative electron microscopy, a 3.5-fold increase of glomerular TGF-beta1/beta-actin mRNA ratio in the moderate sclerotic group (n = 23, p < 0.01) and a 1.5-fold increase in the mild sclerotic group (n = 22, p < 0.05) were observed when compared to the minimal sclerotic group (n = 12). A concordant increase of glomerular alpha2(IV) collagen mRNA was found with 2.2- and 1.3-fold in moderate and mild sclerotic groups, respectively. The TGF-beta1/beta-actin mRNA ratios were highest in membranous nephropathy (466.4 +/- 133.4, n = 11), followed by lupus nephritis (394.9 +/- 94.8, n = 12) and diabetic nephropathy (333.2 +/- 97.6, n = 10). Patients with minimal change disease(233.1 +/- 54.1, n = 15)and IgA nephropathy(185.3 +/- 39.6, n = 9) had low levels. The degree of glomerulosclerosis in each group followed the TGF-beta1/beta-actin mRNA ratios indicating that the level is the major determinant ofglomerulosclerosis but not the disease entities. Glomerular TGF-beta1/beta-actin mRNA ratio did not correlate with clinical parameters such as the urinary protein excretion and creatinine clearance. These results suggest that glomerular TGF-beta1/beta-actin mRNA ratio may be used as a marker of glomerulosclerosis in renal biopsy to reflect the local sclerotic process.
9773841	Transforming growth factor-beta levels in maternal milk and expression in postnatal rat duodenum and ileum.	After birth, the gastrointestinal tract of the neonate is exposed to food and bacterial and environmental antigens. Maternal milk components may play a role in regulation of mucosal immune activity to luminal antigens. In this study we determine the ontogeny of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1-producing cells in the rat pup small intestine and assess maternal milk concentrations of TGF-beta. Intestinal tissue samples of duodenum and ileum were collected, processed, and stained for TGF-beta1, and in situ hybridization for TGF-beta1 mRNA was also performed on the duodenum. TGF-beta levels in milk were assayed by ELISA. TGF-beta2 levels in milk were high at d 6, and declined thereafter at d 10 and 19. TGF-beta1 was not detected. In contrast, the cell number and intensity of staining of TGF-beta1 peptide in the small intestine was low in 3- and 10-d-old rats and increased markedly by 19 d of life. In the duodenum mRNA levels mirrored this trend. TGF-beta1 expression in the lamina propria was absent before d 19, and increased progressively over time. Maternal milk TGF-beta2 levels are high in early milk and decrease during the weaning period. In contrast, endogenous TGF-beta production in the small intestine increases during the weaning period.
10932230	Peripherally administered antibodies against amyloid beta-peptide enter the central nervous system and reduce pathology in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease.	One hallmark of Alzheimer disease is the accumulation of amyloid beta-peptide in the brain and its deposition as plaques. Mice transgenic for an amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) mini-gene driven by a platelet-derived (PD) growth factor promoter (PDAPP mice), which overexpress one of the disease-linked mutant forms of the human amyloid precursor protein, show many of the pathological features of Alzheimer disease, including extensive deposition of extracellular amyloid plaques, astrocytosis and neuritic dystrophy. Active immunization of PDAPP mice with human amyloid beta-peptide reduces plaque burden and its associated pathologies. Several hypotheses have been proposed regarding the mechanism of this response. Here we report that peripheral administration of antibodies against amyloid beta-peptide, was sufficient to reduce amyloid burden. Despite their relatively modest serum levels, the passively administered antibodies were able to enter the central nervous system, decorate plaques and induce clearance of preexisting amyloid. When examined in an ex vivo assay with sections of PDAPP or Alzheimer disease brain tissue, antibodies against amyloid beta-peptide triggered microglial cells to clear plaques through Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis and subsequent peptide degradation. These results indicate that antibodies can cross the blood-brain barrier to act directly in the central nervous system and should be considered as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of Alzheimer disease and other neurological disorders.
12119423	Prominent neurodegeneration and increased plaque formation in complement-inhibited Alzheimer's mice.	Abnormal accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with prominent brain inflammation. Whereas earlier studies concluded that this inflammation is detrimental, more recent animal data suggest that at least some inflammatory processes may be beneficial and promote Abeta clearance. Consistent with these observations, overproduction of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 resulted in a vigorous microglial activation that was accompanied by at least a 50% reduction in Abeta accumulation in human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice. In a search for inflammatory mediators associated with this reduced pathology, we found that brain levels of C3, the central component of complement and a key inflammatory protein activated in AD, were markedly higher in hAPP/TGF-beta1 mice than in hAPP mice. To assess the importance of complement in the pathogenesis of AD-like disease in mice, we inhibited C3 activation by expressing soluble complement receptor-related protein y (sCrry), a complement inhibitor, in the brains of hAPP mice. Abeta deposition was 2- to 3-fold higher in 1-year-old hAPP/sCrry mice than in age-matched hAPP mice and was accompanied by a prominent accumulation of degenerating neurons. These results indicate that complement activation products can protect against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and may reduce the accumulation or promote the clearance of amyloid and degenerating neurons. These findings provide evidence for a role of complement and innate immune responses in AD-like disease in mice and support the concept that certain inflammatory defense mechanisms in the brain may be beneficial in neurodegenerative disease.
12164872	Effects of high glucose and TGF-beta1 on the expression of collagen IV and vascular endothelial growth factor in mouse podocytes.	UNLABELLED: Effects of high glucose and TGF-beta1 on the expression of collagen IV and vascular endothelial growth factor in mouse podocytes. BACKGROUND: The podocyte takes center stage in the pathogenesis of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickening and proteinuria in diabetic glomerulopathy. In part, GBM thickening may occur when the podocyte synthesizes increased amounts of collagen IV. Proteinuria may develop if the podocyte secretes excessive amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which may increase the glomerular permeability to macromolecules. The augmented production of collagen IV and VEGF may be caused by metabolic mediators of diabetes such as hyperglycemia and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). METHODS: The effects of high glucose and exogenous TGF-beta1 were examined on a mouse podocyte cell line that retains its differentiated phenotype. The gene expression and protein production of certain alpha chains of collagen IV, the major isoforms of VEGF, and components of the TGF-beta system were assayed. An inhibitor of TGF-beta signaling was used to determine whether some of the high glucose effects might be mediated by the TGF-beta system. RESULTS: Compared with normal glucose (5.5 mmol/L), high glucose (HG, 25 mmol/L) for 14 days stimulated [3H]-proline incorporation, a measure of collagen production, by 1.8-fold, and exogenous TGF-beta1 (2 ng/mL) for 24 hours stimulated proline incorporation by 2.4-fold. Northern analysis showed that exposure to HG for 14 days increased the mRNA level of alpha1(IV) collagen by 51% and alpha5(IV) by 90%, whereas treatment with TGF-beta1 (2 ng/mL) for 24 hours decreased the mRNA level of alpha1(IV) by 36% and alpha5(IV) by 40%. Consistent with these effects on mRNA expression, Western blotting showed that HG increased alpha1(IV) protein by 44% and alpha5(IV) by 28%, while TGF-beta1 decreased alpha1(IV) protein by 29% and alpha5(IV) by 7%. In contrast to their opposing actions on alpha1 and alpha5(IV), both HG and exogenous TGF-beta1 increased alpha3(IV) collagen and VEGF, with TGF-beta1 having the greater effect. An inhibitor of the TGF-beta type I receptor (ALK5) was able to prevent the stimulation of alpha3(IV) and VEGF proteins by HG. Unlike in other renal cell types, HG did not increase TGF-beta1 mRNA or protein in the podocyte, but HG did induce the expression of the ligand-binding TGF-beta type II receptor (TbetaRII). Because HG had up-regulated TbetaRII after two weeks, the addition of physiological-dose TGF-beta1 (0.010 ng/mL) for 24 hours stimulated the production of alpha3(IV) and VEGF proteins to a greater extent in high than in normal glucose. Up-regulation of TbetaRII in the podocyte was corroborated by immunohistochemistry of the kidney cortex in the db/db mouse, a model of type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: High glucose and exogenous TGF-beta1 exert disparate effects on the expression of alpha1 and alpha5(IV) collagen. However, high glucose and TGF-beta1 coordinately induce the production of alpha3(IV) collagen and VEGF in the podocyte. The HG-induced increases in alpha3(IV) collagen and VEGF proteins are mediated by the TGF-beta system. By increasing the expression of TbetaRII, high glucose may augment the response of the podocyte to ambient levels of TGF-beta1.
12219869	Transforming growth factor-beta1 levels in hypertensive patients: association with body mass index and leptin.	BACKGROUND: Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) has been demonstrated to be overexpressed in hypertension. Leptin, an adipocyte product, has been shown to play a role in obesity-related hypertension and in vitro studies demonstrated a biologic interaction between leptin and TGF-beta1. Thus, we evaluate a possible in vivo association between TGF-beta1, body mass index (BMI), and leptin circulating levels in hypertensive subjects. METHODS: Blood samples for fasting leptin and TGF-beta1, were evaluated in 29 overweight, 46 obese, and 29 nonobese hypertensive patients before and after a 12-week calorie-restricted diet. Monocyte cultures were used for in vitro experiments. RESULTS: Transforming growth factor-beta1 was significantly elevated in hypertensive obese patients (n = 46) as compared with TGF-beta1 levels of hypertensive patients with normal BMI (n = 29) (8. 9 +/- 3 ng/mL v 4.4 +/- 2; P < .001). The circulating levels of TGF-beta1 were associated with BMI and leptin levels in an univariate analysis (r = 0.59, P < .0001; r = 0.62, P < .0001, respectively) and these associations were still present after stepwise multivariate analysis. Weight loss of 10% produced a parallel decrease in TGF-beta1 (from 8.9 +/- 3 ng/mL to 5.3 +/- 2.8 ng/mL; P < .01) and leptin levels (from 30 +/- 24 ng/mL to 17 +/- 14; P < .05). In vitro experiments showed that leptin is able to induce a dose-dependent increase in TGF-beta1 production and mRNA expression in human monocyte cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that TGF-beta1 levels are positively associated with BMI and leptin levels in hypertensive patients and suggest that adipose tissue may be an important determinant of TGF-beta1 levels possibly by a leptin-dependent pathway.
8020153	Growth suppression of transformed BALB/c 3T3 cells by transforming growth factor beta 1 occurs only in the presence of their normal counterparts.	Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) enhances the yield of transformed foci of BALB/c 3T3 cells, but the continuous presence of TGF-beta 1 after foci formation inhibits the growth of transformed foci. The focus-forming ability of Ha-ras-, v-src- and PyMT-transformed cells growing on a monolayer of non-transformed cells was completely suppressed by TGF-beta 1, whereas growth of the transformed cells was little inhibited by TGF-beta 1 in the absence of their normal counterparts. The inhibition by TGF-beta 1 of focus formation by transformed BALB/c 3T3 cells on a normal cell monolayer remained when TGF-beta 1 was removed from the culture medium after 2 weeks. However, the transformed cells were not killed, since they grew in culture conditions under which only transformed cells are able to grow (soft agar). These results suggest that TGF-beta 1 suppresses growth of transformed cells in the presence of normal cells. Furthermore, when non-transformed cells were treated with TGF-beta 1 before co-culture with Ha-ras-transformed cells, formation of transformed foci was inhibited. When normal and transformed cells were cultured in the same dish but separated physically, focus formation was still inhibited. On the other hand, TGF-beta 1 enhanced the growth and changed the morphology of non-transformed cells only in the presence of transformed counterparts. The growth inhibitory effect of TGF-beta 1 on transformed cells and its growth stimulatory effect on non-transformed cells in co-culture conditions suggest the induction of reciprocal paracrine growth regulatory factors. As TGF-beta 1 inhibits the growth of transformed BALB/c 3T3 cells only in the presence of their normal counterparts, a paracrine negative growth control mechanism appears to be operating.
9579549	Genetically modified dermal keratinocytes express high levels of transforming growth factor-beta1.	In an attempt to genetically modify cultured keratinocytes with transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), which has been proven to be one of the most important cytokines involved in wound healing, two constructs were made. One, designated pG3Z:K14-TGF-beta1, is a plasmid in which the expression of TGF-beta1 is driven by the keratin 14 promoter. The other, designated pLin-TGF-beta1, is a retroviral vector in which the retroviral 5' long-terminal repeat promoter drives expression. In both constructs, the deletion of a small fragment of the noncoding region of the TGF-beta1 gene was made to differentiate the transcript from that for endogenously expressed TGF-beta1. Different types of cells were transfected with the pG3Z:K14-TGF-beta1 construct using the calcium phosphate method. The pLin-TGF-beta1 construct was propagated in a retroviral packaging cell line and conditioned medium that contained high titers of the virus was used to transduce keratinocytes or other types of cells grown in standard culture. Northern analysis, used to evaluate the expression of TGF-beta1 mRNA in the pG3Z:K14-TGF-beta1 transfected keratinocyte C1-177 cell line, showed a smaller TGF-beta1 transcript compared with that endogenously expressed by dermal fibroblasts. The level of TGF-beta1 protein evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was significantly higher in medium conditioned by either the K14-TGF-beta1 transfected or the pLin-TGF-beta1 transduced keratinocytes, compared with that obtained from control cells; however, the level of TGF-beta1 protein was unchanged in cultures of pG3Z:K14-TGF-beta1 transfected nonkeratinocyte cells such as fetal and adult fibroblasts. Using the mink lung epithelial cell growth inhibition assay, we found an increase in TGF-beta1 activity in conditioned medium from the pG3Z:K14-TGF-beta1 transfected cells. To evaluate possible paracrine effects of the keratinocyte derived TGF-beta1, a coculture system was established with pLin-TGF-beta1 transduced keratinocytes grown in the upper chamber and dermal fibroblasts in the lower chamber. The results showed that TGF-beta1 released from keratinocytes diffused to the lower chamber where it stimulated collagen production by dermal fibroblasts. In summary, we demonstrate here that primary cultured keratinocytes can be genetically modified to express high levels of TGF-beta1 and suggest that this offers a potential approach for the therapy of dermal lesions such as nonhealing wounds.
11493029	Increased cystatin C in astrocytes of transgenic mice expressing the K670N-M671L mutation of the amyloid precursor protein and deposition in brain amyloid plaques.	Cystatin C is an essential secretory cofactor for neurogenesis with potent protease inhibitor activities. Polymorphisms of cystatin C are genetically associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the L68Q mutation causes hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of the Icelandic type, in which cystatin C and beta-amyloid are colocalized in cortical blood vessels. To determine whether cystatin C and beta-amyloid also colocalize in brain amyloid plaques, we analyzed transgenic mice expressing the Swedish APP (SweAPP) mutation. We found high levels of cystatin C in astrocytes surrounding beta-amyloid plaques, and discrete layers of cystatin C attached to amyloid plaque cores covered by a layer of beta-amyloid. In addition, cystatin C accumulated in reactive astrocytes throughout the brain, independently of, and before the onset of, amyloid plaque formation. These results show that expression of SweAPP is associated with increased cystatin C in reactive astrocytes, and they suggest an early role of cystatin C in appositional amyloid plaque growth.
12485912	Regulation of promoter activity of the APP gene by cytokines and growth factors: implications in Alzheimer's disease.	One of the major pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the presence of brain depositions of senile plaques that are primarily composed of potentially toxic amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), which is generated from a family of Abeta-containing precursor proteins (APP; 695-770 amino acids). The role of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Our goal is to study the effects of these factors on the regulation of APP gene expression. Here we compared APP promoter activity in the presence of different growth factors and cytokines such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), interleukin (IL-1), nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrofin-3 (NT-3), transforming growth factor (TGF-beta1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha1). PC12 neuronal cells, which were treated separately with these agents, were transfected with the construct containing either 190 bp APP proximal promoter region (-46 to 144 bp with respect to the transcription start site [+1]), 94 bp APP 5'-untranslated region (UTR, +50 to 144) or other 5'-UTR-deleted regions. Each construct was cloned upstream of a reporter chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene (CAT). The treatment of PC12 cells with NGF stimulated reporter activity in all constructs tested. The treatment of cells with BDNF, NT3, TGF-beta1, or TNF-alpha stimulated reporter activity in a promoter/UTR-specific manner. Transfection with the complete -46 to 144 region retained the maximum stimulatory activity for any treatment tested in PC12 cells. These results suggest that the regulatory elements of the APP gene respond to the stimulation of different growth factors, cytokines, and interleukins. This is consistent with the effects of the different growth factors, cytokines, and interleukins on APP message and protein levels.
8205729	Cerebral amyloid angiopathy and intracerebral hemorrhage with special reference to the pons.	Cerebral amyloid angiopathy accounts for approximately 10% of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, typically in the cortex and subcortical white matter. Its contribution to primary pontine hemorrhage is not known. The present study was designed to determine if amyloid angiopathy occurs in the pons and whether primary pontine hemorrhages are associated with amyloid infiltration of nearby vessels. Two groups of patients were identified. Group A included 30 patients with proven CAA in whom special blocks of the pons were taken, group B consisted of 10 primary pontine hemorrhages in whom transverse blocks were available. A congo red stain and an A4 immunohistochemical technique were used. Only 1 patient from group A and none from group B had amyloid angiopathy in the pons. It is concluded that pontine angiopathy is rare and an exceptional cause of primary pontine hemorrhage.
8617876	Modulation of transforming growth factor beta receptor levels on microvascular endothelial cells during in vitro angiogenesis.	Microvascular endothelial cells (RFCs) cultured in two-dimensional (2D) cultures proliferate rapidly and exhibit an undifferentiated phenotype. Addition of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) increases fibronectin expression and inhibits proliferation. RFCs cultured in three-dimensional (3D) type I collagen gels proliferate slowly and are refractory to the anti-proliferative effects of TGF beta1. TGF beta1 promotes tube formation in 3D cultures. TGF beta1 increases fibronectin expression and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) activity and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels in 3D cultures. Since the TGF beta type I and II receptors have been reported to regulate different activities induced by TGF beta1, we compared the TGF beta receptor profiles on cells in 2D and 3D cultures. RFCs in 3D cultures exhibited a significant loss of cell surface type II receptor compared with cells in 2D cultures. The inhibitory effect of TGF beta1 on proliferation is suppressed in transfected 2D cultures expressing a truncated form of the type II receptor, while its stimulatory effect on fibronectin production is reduced in both 2D and 3D transfected cultures expressing a truncated form of the type I receptor. These data suggest that the type II receptor mediates the antiproliferative effect of TGF beta1 while the type I receptor mediates the matrix response of RFCs to TGF beta1 and demonstrate that changes in the matrix environment can modulate the surface expression of TGF beta receptors, altering the responsiveness of RFCs to TGF beta1.
9798919	Regulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 mRNA accumulation by basic fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta1 in cultured rat astrocytes.	The effects of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were examined on the accumulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) mRNA in astrocytes in vitro. Both cytokines stimulated PAI-1 mRNA expression transiently with a maximal fivefold (bFGF) and 30-fold (TGF-beta1) at 4 h, decreasing to basal levels within 32 h. EC50 values were 1.4 nM for bFGF and 6.7 pM for TGF-beta1 on PAI-1 mRNA accumulation. A twofold increase in content of tPA mRNA was observed with bFGF but not with TGF-beta1. The action of TGF-beta1 on PAI-1 mRNA was inhibited by cycloheximide, indicating a requirement for de novo protein synthesis. In contrast, cycloheximide potentiated the action of bFGF. Nuclear run-on assays showed that bFGF, but not TGF-beta1, stimulated astrocytic PAI-1 gene transcription. Thus, TGF-beta1 predominantly uses posttranscriptional mechanisms to raise the level of PAI-1 mRNA in astrocytes, whereas bFGF acts at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. The data reveal differences in the mechanisms underlying the regulation of PAI-1 mRNA levels by TGF-beta1 in astrocytes compared with other cells. The action of TGF-beta1 and bFGF on the plasminogen activator system in astrocytes might be involved in the cellular events accompanying glial activation following injury of the CNS.
10381274	Colony stimulating factors modulate the transcription of type VIII collagen in vascular smooth muscle cells.	Colony stimulating factors belong to a family of cytokines that regulate proliferation in macrophages and other vascular cell types. They have been implicated in the inflammatory-fibroproliferative response of atherosclerosis. The present study was undertaken to assess the effect of granulocyte-macrophage and macrophage colony stimulating factors on the transcription of type VIII collagen by vascular smooth muscle cells and their potential relevance for the expression of collagen in atherosclerotic lesions. The influence of colony stimulating factors was studied in relation to transforming growth factor beta1, the factor exhibiting the most potent effect on collagen metabolism. Northern blot experiments showed that treatment with both colony stimulating factors and transforming growth factor beta1 transiently stimulated the transcription of type VIII collagen mRNA. Maximal levels were reached after 2 h and 100 pg/ml granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (4-fold), 1 U/ml macrophage colony stimulating factor (4.6-fold) and 1 ng/ml transforming growth factor beta1 (1.6-fold). While overnight treatment with colony stimulating factors stimulated the expression of transforming growth factor beta1 mRNA, short incubations did not influence or downregulate the transcription. In turn, treatment with transforming growth factor beta1 reduced the expression of granulocyte-macrophage and macrophage colony stimulating factor mRNA. The in vitro mRNA expression patterns were directly reflected in the distribution patterns found in intimal thickenings and advanced atherosclerotic lesions. This study demonstrates that colony stimulating factors and transforming growth factor beta1 modulate the transcription of type VIII collagen in vitro. Our data indicate a direct mechanism and exclude a pathway, which is mediated via the stimulation of transforming growth factor beta1 transcription. Our studies further support the hypothesis that colony stimulating factors in concert with transforming growth factor beta1 affect the collagenous composition of the extracellular vascular matrix.
10867209	The role of apolipoprotein E in Alzheimer's disease, acute brain injury and cerebrovascular disease: evidence of common mechanisms and utility of animal models.	The epsilon 4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE denotes gene; apoE denotes protein) is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). More recent evidence indicates an association with a poor outcome after acute brain injury including that due to head trauma and intracerebral hemorrhage. APOE gene polymorphism also influences the risk of hemorrhage in cerebral amyloid angiopathy. These diverse brain disorders seem to have some mechanisms in common. The multiplicity of the roles of apoE within the central nervous system is currently being unraveled. For example, apoE can interact with amyloid beta-protein and tau, proteins central to the pathogenesis of AD. In addition to these effects, it is proposed that one of the major functions of apoE is to mediate neuronal protection, repair and remodeling. In all of the different roles proposed, there are marked apoE-isoform specific differences. Although it remains to be clarified which is the most important mechanism(s) in each disorder in which apoE is involved, these isoform specific differences seem to underly a genetically determined susceptibility to outcome from acute brain injury and to AD with APOE epsilon 4 conferring relative vulnerability. This review focuses on apoE research, from clinical studies to animal models, in AD, acute brain injury and cerebrovascular disease and explores the common mechanisms that may explain some of the complex underlying neurobiology.
10997555	Rhodostomin inhibits the transforming growth factor-beta1-enhanced adhesion activity of ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells.	We have investigated the effect of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) on the in vitro adhesion activity of the rat osteosarcoma cell lines (ROS 17/2.8) to extracellular matrix substrata, including fibronectin, type I and IV collagen, as well as laminin. The interaction of Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) and rhodostomin, an RGD containing snake venom, with TGF-beta1 on the cell adhesion was also evaluated. The results showed that incubation with various concentration of TGF-beta1 (1-15 ng/ml) significantly increased the adhesion activity (1.4 to 2.5 folds) of ROS 17/2.8 to fibronectin and type I collagen (p<0.01), whereas the adhesion activity to laminin and type IV collagen was slightly elevated (1.1 to 1.5 folds). The peak effect of TGF-beta1 on the cell adhesion occurred after pretreatment of ROS 17/2.8 with TGF-beta1 for 6 hours. Treatment with Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) and rhodostomin effectively suppressed the TGF-beta1-enhanced adhesion activity to fibronectin and type I collagen. This study demonstrated that the up-regulated cell adhesion activity of ROS 17/2.8 cells by the TGF-beta1 can be inhibited by the rhodostomin.
11409420	Novel amyloid precursor protein mutation in an Iowa family with dementia and severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy.	Several mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene have been found to associate with pathologic deposition of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in neuritic plaques or in the walls of cerebral vessels. We report a mutation at a novel site in APP in a three-generation Iowa family with autosomal dominant dementia beginning in the sixth or seventh decade of life. The proband and an affected brother had progressive aphasic dementia, leukoencephalopathy, and occipital calcifications. Neuropathological examination of the proband revealed severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy, widespread neurofibrillary tangles, and unusually extensive distribution of Abeta40 in plaques. The affected brothers shared a missense mutation in APP, resulting in substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid at position 694. This site corresponds to residue 23 of Abeta, thus differing from familial Alzheimer's disease mutations, which occur outside the Abeta sequence. Restriction enzyme analysis of DNA from 94 unrelated patients with sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related hemorrhage found no other instances of this mutation. These results suggest a novel site within Abeta that may promote its deposition and toxicity.
10598939	A transforming growth factor-beta antagonist unmasks the neuroprotective role of this endogenous cytokine in excitotoxic and ischemic brain injury.	Various studies describe increased concentrations of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in brain tissue after acute brain injury. However, the role of endogenously produced TGF-beta after brain damage to the CNS remains to be clearly established. Here, the authors examine the influence of TGF-beta produced after an episode of cerebral ischemia by injecting a soluble TGF-beta type II receptor fused with the Fc region of a human immunoglobulin (TbetaRIIs-Fc). First, this molecular construct was characterized as a selective antagonist of TGF-beta. Then, the authors tested its ability to reverse the effect of TGF-beta1 on excitotoxic cell death in murine cortical cell cultures. The addition of 1 microg/mL of TbetaRIIs-Fc to the exposure medium antagonized the neuroprotective activity of TGF-beta1 in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxic cell death. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that TGF-beta1 exerts a negative modulatory action on NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. To determine the role of TGF-beta1 produced in response to brain damage, the authors used a model of an excitotoxic lesion induced by the intrastriatal injection of 75 nmol of NMDA in the presence of 1.5 microg of TbetaRIIs-Fc. The intrastriatal injection of NMDA was demonstrated to induce an early upregulation of the expression of TGF-beta1 mRNA. Furthermore, when added to the excitotoxin, TbetaRIIs-Fc increased (by 2.2-fold, P < 0.05) the lesion size. These observations were strengthened by the fact that an intracortical injection of TbetaRIIs-Fc in rats subjected to a 30-minute reversible cerebral focal ischemia aggravated the volume of infarction. In the group injected with the TGF-beta1 antagonist, a 3.5-fold increase was measured in the infarction size (43.3 +/- 9.5 versus 152.8 +/- 46.3 mm3; P < 0.05). In conclusion, by antagonizing the influence of TGF-beta in brain tissue subjected to excitotoxic or ischemic lesion, the authors markedly exacerbated the resulting extent of necrosis. These results suggest that, in response to such insults, brain tissue responds by the synthesis of a neuroprotective cytokine, TGF-beta1, which is involved in the limitation of the extent of the injury. The pharmacologic potentiation of this endogenous defensive mechanism might represent an alternative and novel strategy for the therapy of hypoxic-ischemic cerebral injury.
10623661	Chronic overproduction of transforming growth factor-beta1 by astrocytes promotes Alzheimer's disease-like microvascular degeneration in transgenic mice.	Cerebrovascular amyloid deposition and microvascular degeneration are frequently associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the etiology and pathogenetic role of these abnormalities are unknown. Recently, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) was implicated in cerebrovascular amyloid formation in transgenic mice with astroglial overproduction of TGF-beta1 and in AD. We tested whether TGF-beta1 overproduction induces AD-like cerebrovascular degeneration and analyzed how cerebrovascular abnormalities develop over time in TGF-beta1-transgenic mice. In cerebral microvessels from 3- to 4-month-old TGF-beta1-transgenic mice, which display a prominent perivascular astrocytosis, levels of the basement membrane proteins perlecan and fibronectin were severalfold higher than in vessels from nontransgenic mice. Consistent with this increase, cortical capillary basement membranes of TGF-beta1 mice were significantly thickened. These changes preceded amyloid deposition, which began at around 6 months of age. In 9- and 18-month-old TGF-beta1 mice, various degenerative changes in microvascular cells of the brain were observed. Endothelial cells were thinner and displayed abnormal, microvilli-like protrusions as well as occasional condensation of chromatin, and pericytes occupied smaller areas in capillary profiles than in nontransgenic controls. Similar cerebrovascular abnormalities have been reported in AD. We conclude that chronic overproduction of TGF-beta1 triggers an accumulation of basement membrane proteins and results in AD-like cerebrovascular amyloidosis and microvascular degeneration. Closely related processes may induce cerebrovascular pathology in AD.
14599636	Clinical gene therapy for nonmalignant disease.	Gene therapy is envisioned as a potentially definitive treatment for a variety of diseases that have a genetic etiology. We reviewed trials of clinical gene therapy for nonmalignant, single-gene, and multifactorial disorders and infectious diseases, and found limited evidence suggesting that gene therapy may benefit patients who have severe, combined, immunodeficiency disorder; cystic fibrosis; coronary artery disease or peripheral arterial disease; or hemophilia. Effective gene therapy requires the targeted transfer of exogenous genetic material into human cells and the subsequent regulated expression of the corresponding gene product. Because no phase 3 randomized controlled trials have been completed that fulfill these criteria, it is difficult to correlate signs of clinical benefit with the administration of gene therapy in any disease. Additional clinical and basic research is needed to determine the future role of gene therapy.
9299175	Effect of transforming growth factor-beta1 and -beta2 on in vitro rabbit corneal epithelial cell proliferation promoted by epidermal growth factor, keratinocyte growth factor, or hepatocyte growth factor.	Corneal epithelial wound healing is intimately controlled by a variety of growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and transforming growth factor-betas (TGF-betas). In this study, we investigate the effects of TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 on cultured rabbit corneal epithelial cell proliferation promoted by EGF, KGF, or HGF. Both TGF-beta1 and -beta2 dose-dependently inhibited corneal epithelial cell proliferation promoted by KGF (40 ng ml-1) and HGF (40 ng ml-1), and weakly inhibited cell proliferation promoted by EGF (4 ng ml-1). Furthermore, the inhibitory effect tended to be stronger with TGF-beta2 than TGF-beta1. These findings suggest that TGF-beta1 and -beta2 play important roles as negative modulators against the cell proliferation effect of EGF, KGF and HGF.
9643008	[Characterization of amyloid beta protein species in the plasma, cerebrospinal fluid and brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease].	Extracellular deposition of amyloid beta protein (A beta) as senile plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is one of the essential pathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several A beta species with different carboxyl termini, including A beta 42 (43) and A beta 40 ending at residue 42 (43) and 40, respectively, have been identified in CAA and in senile plaque cores. Because A beta 42 (43), the major component of diffuse plaque which is the earliest pathological change in AD brains, forms insoluble amyloid fibrils more rapidly than does A beta 40, it has been hypothesized that A beta 42 (43) plays a role in amyloid seeding and A beta 40, in the elongation of amyloid fibrils on a seed of A beta 42 (43). We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with site-specific monoclonal antibodies to differentiate A beta 42 (43) from A beta 40. First, we measured the amounts of different A beta species in plasma from patients with sporadic probable AD, age-matched patients with neurologic diseases but without dementia, and age-matched normal controls. Concentrations of A beta 1-40 and A beta 1-42 (43) in plasma did not differ significantly among the three groups. Second, CSF levels of A beta species (CSF-A beta) with different carboxy termini, i.e., A beta X-40 and A beta X-42 (43) as well as A beta 1-40 and A beta 1-42 (43), were measured in patients with AD and in age-matched controls without dementia using ELISA. Levels of both CSF-A beta X-42 (43) and A beta 1-42 (43) were significantly lower in the patients with AD that in the controls, but neither the levels of CSF-A beta X-40 nor those of CSF-A beta 1-40 differed between the two groups, which suggest that increased adsorption of A beta 42 (43) to A beta deposition in AD brains, decreased secretion of A beta 42 (43) in CSF, or increased clearance of A beta 42 (43) from CSF might explain the low levels of A beta 42 (43) in the CSF of patients with AD. Third, we measured the concentrations of various A beta species post-mortem in the cerebral cortex of patients with PS-1 mutations and beta amyloid precursor protein (APP) 717 mutation linked to familial AD or Down syndrome. The results indicate that one effect of PS-1 mutations, APP717 mutation and Down syndrome is to cause dramatic and accelerated accumulation of A beta 42 (43) in the brain as compared with sporadic AD. In particular, the increases in A beta 1-42 (43) showed a crude inverse correlation with the age of onset in each subtype of AD. Thus, quantitative studies differentiating A beta 42 (43) from A beta 40 have established the fundamental importance of A beta 42 (43) in AD.
11676289	The effects of AbetaPP mutations and APOE polymorphisms on cerebral amyloid angiopathy.	Analysis of causative mutations and genetic risk factors aid in the understanding of important processes of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in humans. We identified a mutation at a novel site of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (AbetaPP) gene associated with familial CAA; this mutation causes an aspartate to asparagine substitution at position 23 of the Abeta peptide. Neuropathological analysis of a 68-year-old man with this mutation showed dramatic Abeta deposition in blood vessels, diffiuse parenchymal Abeta deposits, dystrophic neurites and neurofibrillary tangles. The Abeta deposition showed complete co-localization of Abeta40 and Abeta42, compared to the predominant Abeta42 deposition seen in AD. We hypothesize that the loss of an acidic residue at position 23 of Abeta might be important in the process of Abeta aggregation on smooth muscle cells on the cerebrovasculature. We also analyzed how the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene might influence aggregation of Abeta by examining the physical association of apoE domains with Abeta via immunohistochemistry. We found that the lipid-binding domain of apoE was more strongly associated with Abeta than the receptor-binding domain, and that 40% of all Abeta deposits had no apoE bound to them. We suggest that the initial deposition of Abeta occurs in the absence of apoE, and that the process of Abeta deposit growth or stabilization is apoE-dependent.
11846043	UV light-induced autofluorescence of full-length Abeta-protein deposits in the human brain.	The formation of amyloid plaques is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid plaques and vascular amyloid deposits in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) consist of the beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) in association with other proteins. These Abeta-deposits can be visualized by thioflavin S, Congo red staining, silver staining methods and immunohistochemistry. Senile plaques also have been shown to exhibit blue autofluorescence. Here we report that UV light-induced autofluorescence is restricted to full-length Abeta-containing amyloid plaques and is also seen in blood vessels affected by CAA. Different types of samples from AD and control cortices were examined: native samples, formalin-fixed paraffin and polyethylene glycol-embedded tissue sections. These samples were viewed with a fluorescence microscope under UV light excitation (360 - 370 nm). By emitting blue fluorescence (>420 nm), amyloid plaques and blood vessels affected by CAA were detected in AD and CAA samples. Combination with immunofluorescence against anti-Abeta1-42, anti-Abeta17-24, and anti-Abeta8-17 demonstrated co-localization of the autofluorescent deposits with full-length Abeta containing Abeta-deposits. N-terminal truncated Abeta-deposits, such as the fleecy amyloid, do not exhibit autofluorescence. In doing so, Abeta-autofluorescence is a suitable method for screening native tissue samples for full-length Abeta-deposits. In contradistinction to conventional and immunohistochemical procedures, detection of plaques and CAA by autofluorescence enables the recognition of full-length Abeta-deposits in the human brain without any chemical interaction whatsoever on the part of Abeta.
7645299	Women's roles and health: the mediating effect of perceived control.	Research concerning women's roles and health has revealed inconsistencies regarding the effects of work/family roles on women's health. Recent work in this area suggests that role characteristics or role quality may be more important in determining health than simple role occupancy. In addition, it has been suggested that role factors may affect health by increasing or decreasing one's perceptions of personal control over life. This study uses logistic regression techniques on data from the 1987 General Social Survey to explore the effects of roles and role quality on women's health, as well as the mediating effects of perceived control in the relationship between role factors and health. It is hypothesized that (1) role quality variables are better predictors of health than role occupancy, (2) the effects on health of roles, and role quality, are mediated by perceived control. In the role occupancy model, findings show that employment is the only role associated with health, and perceived control does modify this relationship slightly. Both high and low quality employment roles predict better health, whereas only high quality marital roles predict better health. While perceived control does mediate slightly the effects of job quality on health, the positive effects of marital status on health are suppressed slightly by perceived control.
9852291	Prothymosin alpha1 antagonizes the inhibitory effects of transforming growth factor-beta1 on the adhesion of peripheral blood lymphocytes to human umbilical vein endothelial cells.	We investigated the in vitro effects of both prothymosin alpha1 (Pro alpha1) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) on the adhesion of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and on the expression of the adhesion molecules, endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). TGF-beta1 moderately but significantly decreased PBL-binding to interleukin-1 (IL-1)- stimulated HUVECs. However, Pro alpha1 in combination with TGF-beta1 completely restored the TGF-beta1 mediated effects. Other thymic peptides tested were ineffective. On HUVECs, TGF-beta1 diminished ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression, leaving ELAM-1 unchanged. Pro alpha1 in combination with TGF-beta1 showed no significant effects on ELAM-1 expression, but antagonized the TGF-beta1-induced decrease of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression on activated HUVECs.
12058090	Cerebral amyloid angiopathy and cognitive function: the HAAS autopsy study.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), dementia, and cognitive function in an autopsy sample of 211 Japanese-American men from the population-based Honolulu-Asia Aging Study. METHODS: Starting in 1991, participants were assessed with the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) and diagnosed with dementia (including subtype) based on published criteria. At autopsy, neuropathologists blinded to clinical data examined brains for neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), neuritic plaques (NP), and a number of vascular pathologies, including CAA. CAA was detected by immunostaining for betaA4 amyloid in parenchymal vessels in the neocortex and semiquantitatively rated. Linear regression models were used to examine the association of CASI score, dementia subtype, and CAA controlling for age at death, time between CASI administration and death, education, NP and NFT counts, infarcts, hemorrhage, and APOE genotype. RESULTS: A total of 44.1% of subjects had CAA in at least one neocortical area. The presence of CAA was associated with higher mean NFT and NP counts and having at least one APOE-epsilon4 allele. The interaction between CAA and AD on the adjusted mean CASI score was significant; compared with nondemented men without CAA, the CASI score was 16.6% lower in men with AD and no CAA and 45.9% lower in men with AD plus CAA. CONCLUSIONS: CAA may contribute to the clinical presentation of dementia by interacting with other neuronal pathologies, leading to more severe cognitive impairment in men with both CAA and AD compared with men with only AD or CAA.
7712485	Drug resistance and gene amplification potential regulated by transforming growth factor beta 1 gene expression.	Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) regulates a multitude of diverse biological functions in mammalian cells, and there is good evidence that aberrant expression of this growth factor can play an important role in mechanisms of malignant progression. We show that a TGF-beta 1-overexpressing mouse 10T1/2 cell line transfected with a TGF-beta 1 sequence that allows the synthesis of bioactive growth factor exhibits reduced sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of the drug N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA) in colony-forming experiments. Furthermore, six independent 10T1/2 TGF-beta 1-transfected cell lines containing TGF-beta 1 gene expression under the control of a zinc sulfate-responsive metallothionein promoter were selected. In all cases, sensitivity to PALA cytotoxic effects was significantly reduced when cells were cultured under conditions that led to elevated levels of TGF-beta 1 gene expression when compared to cells containing basal levels of this growth factor. Fluctuation analysis to determine the rate of PALA resistance was performed with several TGF-beta 1-transfected cell lines in which growth factor expression was regulated by the metallothionein promoter. We observed significantly higher rates of PALA resistance/cell/generation in cell populations expressing high levels of TGF-beta 1 than in the same cells expressing relatively low levels of this growth factor. The only mechanism known for PALA resistance in mouse cells involves the amplification of the gene coding for the protein target of PALA, CAD, a multifunctional polypeptide containing carbamyl phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase. Southern blot analysis of colonies that survived normally cytotoxic concentrations of PALA exhibited CAD gene amplification. In total, these observations indicate that aberrant expression of TGF-beta 1 gene expression decreases the genetic stability of 10T1/2 cells, leading to increased rates of drug resistance and elevated gene amplification potential. The results of this study indicate a new malignancy related function for TGF-beta 1 alterations and suggest a novel role for aberrant expression of this growth factor in mechanisms of drug resistance and tumor progression.
9487120	Localization of transforming growth factor-beta1 and type II receptor in developing normal human prostate and carcinoma tissues.	Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is implicated in prostate development, and elevated expression of TGF-beta1 has been correlated with prostate carcinogenesis. In this study, cell type specificity of TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta receptor Type II (RcII) protein expression was determined by immunocytochemistry in human normal prostate and compared to prostate carcinoma tissues. Heterogeneous localization patterns of LAP-TGF-beta1 (TGF-beta1 precursor) and RcII were observed in both epithelial and mesenchymal cells in fetal prostate, with LAP-TGF-beta1 localizing to more basal epithelial cells. Homogeneity of LAP-TGF-beta1 staining was increased in neonatal, prepubertal, and adult prostate, with elevated immunoreactivity noted in epithelial acini relative to stromal tissue for both LAP-TGF-beta1 and RcII proteins. In stromal tissues, RcII cell localization exhibited staining patterns nearly identical to smooth muscle alpha-actin. In prostate carcinoma, LAP-TGF-beta1 localized to carcinoma cells with an increased staining heterogeneity relative to normal prostate. In contrast to normal epithelial cells, carcinoma epithelial cells exhibited low to nondetectable RcII staining. Stromal cell staining patterns for LAP-TGF-beta1 and RcII in carcinoma, however, were identical to those of normal prostate stromal cells. These studies implicate both epithelial and stromal cells as sites of TGF-beta1 synthesis and RcII localization in the developing and adult normal human prostate. In addition, these data indicate a loss of epithelial expression of RcII concurrent with altered LAP-TGF-beta1 expression in human prostate carcinoma cells.
7993086	Construction of phoE-caa, a novel PCR- and immunologically detectable marker gene for Pseudomonas putida.	In this paper we describe the construction and use in Pseudomonas putida WCS358 of phoE-caa, a novel hybrid marker gene, which allows monitoring both at the protein level by immunological methods and at the DNA level by PCR. The marker is based on the Escherichia coli outer membrane protein gene phoE and 75 bp of E. coli caa, which encode a nonbacteriocinic fragment of colicin A. This fragment contains an epitope which is recognized by monoclonal antibody (MAb) 1C11. As the epitope is contained in one of the cell surface-exposed loops of PhoE, whole cells of bacteria expressing the protein can be detected by using the MAb. The marker gene contains only E. coli sequences not coding for toxins and therefore can be considered environmentally safe. The hybrid PhoE-ColA protein was expressed in E. coli under conditions of phosphate starvation, and single cells could be detected by immunofluorescence microscopy with MAb 1C11. Using a wide-host-range vector the phoE-caa gene was introduced into P. putida WCS358. The gene appeared to be expressed under phosphate limitation in this species, and the gene product was present in the membrane fraction and reacted with MAb 1C11. The hybrid PhoE-ColA protein could be detected on whole cells of WCS358 mutant strains lacking (part of) the O-antigen of the lipopolysaccharide but not on wild-type WCS358 cells, unless these cells had previously been washed with 10 mM EDTA. In addition to immunodetection, the phoE-caa marker gene could be specifically detected by PCR with one primer directed to a part of the phoE sequence and a second primer that annealed to the caa insert.
8943274	The length of amyloid-beta in hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis, Dutch type. Implications for the role of amyloid-beta 1-42 in Alzheimer's disease.	In hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis, Dutch type (HCHWA-D), a genetic variant (E22Q) of amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulates predominantly in the small vessels of leptomeninges and cerebral cortex, leading to fatal strokes in the fifth or sixth decade of life. Abeta deposition in the neuropil occurs mainly in the form of preamyloid, Congo red negative deposits, while mature neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, hallmark lesions in Alzheimer's disease (AD), are characteristically absent. A recent hypothesis regarding the pathogenesis of AD states that Abeta extending to residues 42-43 (as opposed to shorter species) can seed amyloid formation and trigger the development of neuritic plaques followed by neuronal damage in AD. We characterized biochemically and immunohistochemically Abeta from three cases of HCHWA-D to determine its length in vascular and parenchymal deposits. Mass spectrometry of formic acid-soluble amyloid, purified by size-exclusion gel chromatography, showed that Abeta 1-40 and its carboxyl-terminal truncated derivatives were the predominant forms in leptomeningeal and cortical vessels. Abeta 1-42 was a minor component in these amyloid extracts. Immunohistochemistry with antibodies S40 and S42, specific for Abeta ending at Val-40 or Ala-42, respectively, were consistent with the biochemical data from vascular amyloid. In addition, parenchymal preamyloid lesions were specifically stained with S42 and were not labeled by S40, in agreement with the pattern reported for AD, Down's syndrome, and aged dogs. Our results suggest that in HCHWA-D the carboxyl-terminal Abeta heterogeneity is due to limited proteolysis in vivo. Moreover, they suggest that Abeta species ending at Ala-42 may not be critical for the seeding of amyloid formation and the development of AD-like neuritic changes.
9329710	Amyloid-beta protein angiopathies masquerading as Alzheimer's disease?	Current evidence from genetic and epidemiological studies supports the view that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous disorder. While the disease is pathologically defined by the presence of specified lesions in form of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles within the parenchyma, other features of pathology are often either neglected or considered coincidental. Our studies suggest that cerebrovascular pathology is inherently part of the disorder, which could be an important factor in a cause or effect manner. We have recently identified subjects having died with severe amyloid beta (A beta) protein cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in the absence of a profound Alzheimer pathology. These subjects, diagnosed with dementia had a late onset disease and were found at autopsy to exhibit severe CAA but paucity of typical AD changes. Immunocytochemical studies showed numerous microvascular abnormalities as well as characteristic degeneration of the vascular smooth muscle in both surface and intracortical vessels. The pathology was also characterized by occasional intracerebral hemorrhages and multiple infarcts. Further assessment of the abnormalities and amyloid infiltrated cerebral vessels with antibodies to the carboxyl terminus of A beta indicated that the longer, more pathogenic form of A beta(1-42) was found to be highly associated with intracerebral hemorrhages. Our observations suggest that these mild AD cases with a predominantly vascular pathology are variants of AD and bear resemblance to the familial Dutch and Flemish versions of cerebral amyloidosis. We propose that AD is a group of diseases with a variable pathology analogous to the prion diseases, in which a vascular variant also exists.
9520006	Clinicopathologic studies in cognitively healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease: relation of histologic markers to dementia severity, age, sex, and apolipoprotein E genotype.	"OBJECTIVE: To study differences between subjects with Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognitively intact control subjects, with respect to brain histologic markers of AD, and the relationship of those markers in the AD group to severity of dementia, age at death, sex, and apolipoprotein E genotype. SETTING: Washington University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, St Louis, Mo. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Consecutive neuropathologic series of 224 prospectively studied volunteer research subjects, 186 with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) or ""incipient"" DAT and confirmed to have AD by postmortem examination and 13 cognitively intact subjects, confirmed to lack postmortem findings of AD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Brain densities (number per square millimeter) of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, extent of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cortical Lewy bodies, and apolipoprotein E genotype. RESULTS: Neocortical neurofibrillary tangle densities were substantially correlated with dementia severity, and to a greater degree than was true for senile plaque densities. When infarcts, hemorrhages, and Parkinson disease changes coexisted with AD, neurofibrillary tangle and senile plaque densities were lower. Plaque-predominant AD was found in a greater proportion of subjects with milder than more severe dementia. Entorhinal cortical Lewy bodies were no more frequent in plaque-predominant AD than in the remaining AD cases. Increasing age at death was negatively correlated with dementia severity and densities of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele frequency was greater in AD than in control subjects but decreased with increasing age. After controlling for dementia severity, senile plaque densities were only weakly related to epsilon4 allele frequency, and only in hippocampus. However, the degree of cerebral amyloid angiopathy was clearly related to epsilon4 allele frequency. Among subjects diagnosed during life as having DAT or incipient DAT, only 7% were found to have a neuropathologic disorder other than AD causing their dementia. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The order of the strength of relationships between densities of histologic markers and dementia severity in AD is neurofibrillary tangles greater than cored senile plaques greater than total senile plaques. (2) Advanced age at death is associated with somewhat less severe dementia and fewer senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. (3) Plaque-predominant AD may represent a developmental stage in AD. (4) Despite a substantial effect of apolipoprotein E epsilon4 as a risk factor for AD, on decreasing the age at AD onset, and increasing the amount of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, its effect on senile plaque densities is variable and complex, being confounded with age, dementia severity, and methodologic differences. (5) Stringent clinical diagnostic criteria for DAT, even in the very mild stage, and senile plaque-based neuropathologic criteria for AD are highly accurate."
12065755	Inhibition of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1-induced extracellular matrix with a novel inhibitor of the TGF-beta type I receptor kinase activity: SB-431542.	Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a potent fibrotic factor responsible for the synthesis of extracellular matrix. TGF-beta1 acts through the TGF-beta type I and type II receptors to activate intracellular mediators, such as Smad proteins, the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. We expressed the kinase domain of the TGF-beta type I receptor [activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)5] and the substrate, Smad3, and determined that SB-431542 is a selective inhibitor of Smad3 phosphorylation with an IC50 of 94 nM. It inhibited TGF-beta1-induced nuclear Smad3 localization. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors SB-203580 and SB-202190 also inhibit phosphorylation of Smad3 by ALK5 with IC50 values of 6 and 3 microM, respectively. This suggests that these p38 MAPK inhibitors must be used at concentrations of less than 10 microM to selectively address p38 MAPK mechanisms. However, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB-242235 did not inhibit ALK5. To evaluate the relative contribution of Smad signaling and p38 MAPK signaling in TGF-beta1-induced matrix production, the effect of SB-431542 was compared with that of SB-242235 in renal epithelial carcinoma A498 cells. All compounds inhibited TGF-beta1-induced fibronectin (FN) mRNA, indicating that FN synthesis is mediated in part via the p38 MAPK pathway. In contrast, SB-431542, but not the selective p38 MAPK inhibitor SB-242235, inhibited TGF-beta1-induced collagen Ialpha1 (col Ialpha1). These data indicate that some matrix markers that are stimulated by TGF-beta1 are mediated via the p38 MAPK pathway (i.e., FN), whereas others seem to be activated via ALK5 signaling independent of the p38 MAPK pathway (i.e., col Ialpha1).
10233423	Possible involvement of bcl-2 in regulation of cell-cycle progression of haemopoietic cells by transforming growth factor-beta1.	Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) acts directly on haemopoietic progenitor cells to regulate their growth. To investigate a possible link between the action of TGF-beta1 and cell death regulators such as bcl-2, we utilized Ba/F3 cells, the interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent growth of which could be modulated by TGF-beta1, as well as haemopoietic progenitor cells. We demonstrate here that up-regulation of bcl-2 protein (Bcl-2) as well as that of an inhibitor of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complex, p27, was associated with TGF-beta1-induced deceleration of the cell-cycling of haemopoietic progenitor cells and Ba/F3 cells. The data from cell-cycle analysis of Ba/F3 cells showed that TGF-beta1 retarded the G1 to S phase transition. Analysis of cells with the potential to express Bcl-2 in an inducible manner indicated that up-regulation of Bcl-2 was sufficient for not only an increase in the level of p27 but also to inhibit the cell growth. Using c-kit-overexpressing cells, we observed that the potential of TGF-beta1 to up-regulate the expression of Bcl-2 and p27 could be counteracted by the c-kit ligand, stem cell factor. These results demonstrate that Bcl-2 exerts an essential function in the regulation of G1 to S phase transition of haemopoietic cells by TGF-beta1.
10570203	Neuronal overexpression of mutant amyloid precursor protein results in prominent deposition of cerebrovascular amyloid.	Transgenic mice that overexpress mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP) exhibit one hallmark of Alzheimer's disease pathology, namely the extracellular deposition of amyloid plaques. Here, we describe significant deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the cerebral vasculature [cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)] in aging APP23 mice that had striking similarities to that observed in human aging and Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid deposition occurred preferentially in arterioles and capillaries and within individual vessels showed a wide heterogeneity (ranging from a thin ring of amyloid in the vessel wall to large plaque-like extrusions into the neuropil). CAA was associated with local neuron loss, synaptic abnormalities, microglial activation, and microhemorrhage. Although several factors may contribute to CAA in humans, the neuronal origin of transgenic APP, high levels of Abeta in cerebrospinal fluid, and regional localization of CAA in APP23 mice suggest transport and drainage pathways rather than local production or blood uptake of Abeta as a primary mechanism underlying cerebrovascular amyloid formation. APP23 mice on an App-null background developed a similar degree of both plaques and CAA, providing further evidence that a neuronal source of APP/Abeta is sufficient to induce cerebrovascular amyloid and associated neurodegeneration.
10750555	Association of transforming growth factor beta1 genotype with therapeutic response to active vitamin D for postmenopausal osteoporosis.	Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is an important regulator of bone metabolism, its effects being intertwined with those of estrogen and vitamin D. A T-->C polymorphism in exon 1 of the TGF-beta1 gene, which results in the substitution of proline for leucine, is associated with bone mineral density (BMD). However, it is not known whether this polymorphism affects the response to treatment with active vitamin D or to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in individuals with osteoporosis. Changes in BMD at the lumbar spine (L2-L4 BMD) were compared among TGF-beta1 genotypes in 363 postmenopausal Japanese women who were divided into three groups: an untreated, control group (n = 130), an active vitamin D treatment group (n = 117), and an HRT group (n = 116). TGF-beta1 genotype was determined with an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction assay. In the control group, the rate of bone loss decreased according to the rank order of genotypes TT (homozygous for the T allele) > TC (heterozygous) > CC (homozygous for the C allele), with a significant difference detected between the CC and TT genotypes. The positive response of L2-L4 BMD to HRT increased according to the rank order of genotypes TT < TC < CC, although the differences among genotypes were not statistically significant. Individuals with the CC genotype responded to active vitamin D treatment with an annual increase in L2-L4 BMD of 1.6%, whereas those with the TT or TC genotypes similarly treated lost bone to a similar extent as did untreated subjects of the corresponding genotype. These results suggest that TGF-beta1 genotype is associated with both the rate of bone loss and the response to active vitamin D treatment.
11192253	Extracellular collagen regulates expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 gene.	A complex interrelationship exists between the extracellular matrix and cytokine signaling in articular chondrocytes. We sought to determine whether the extracellular matrix serves as a regulatory component of transforming growth factor-beta1 expression. Bovine articular chondrocytes were isolated and resuspended in alginate, yielding final extracellular protein concentrations of 0 to 1.5% (wt/vol) for type-II or type-I collagen. Cultures were maintained for 7 days in the presence or absence of transforming growth factor-beta1-supplemented medium (10 ng/ml). The amount of transforming growth factor-beta1 mRNA was examined with quantitative competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. The results indicate that exogenous transforming growth factor-beta1 stimulates endogenous transforming growth factor-beta1 mRNA expression approximately 8-fold. This effect depended on the concentration of extracellular type-II collagen. As the concentration of extracellular type-II collagen is increased, the expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 mRNA decreases in both basal and transforming growth factor-beta1-stimulated cultures. Exogenous extracellular type-I collagen also served to negatively modulate transforming growth factor-beta1 gene expression but with a different concentration profile. The results demonstrate that transforming growth factor-beta1 mRNA expression was upregulated by exogenous transforming growth factor-beta1 and was downregulated by extracellular type-I and type-II collagens. The profoundly different effects on transforming growth factor-beta1 expression by the two collagens are consistent with those reported for mammary epithelial cells and likely serve as a negative feedback mechanism to preserve tissue homeostasis.
9264495	Overexpression of transforming growth factor-beta1 and insulin-like growth factor-I in patients with idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.	BACKGROUND: Idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by regional myocardial hypertrophy. To investigate involvement of growth factors on myocardial hypertrophy in HCM patients, we evaluated gene expression and cellular localization of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II), and platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) in ventricular biopsies obtained from patients with HCM (n=8), aortic stenosis (AS) (n=8), or stable angina (SA) (n=8) and from explanted hearts with ischemic cardiomyopathy (TM) (n=7). METHODS AND RESULTS: Levels of TGF-beta1, IGF-I, IGF-II, and PDGF-B transcripts were quantified with the use of multiplex RT-PCR. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an internal standard. Antibodies against TGF-beta and IGF-I were used to localize their peptides within the myocardium. Antisense and sense (control) cRNA probes of TGF-beta1 and IGF-I, labeled with digoxigenin, were used to localize the growth factor transcripts by in situ hybridization. mRNA levels (densitometric ratio of growth factor/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) of TGF-beta1 and IGF-I in HCM (0.75+/-0.05 and 0.85+/-0.15, respectively; mean+/-1 SEM) were significantly (P<.01 for all groups) elevated in comparison with non-HCM myocardium (AS: 0.38+/-0.07, 0.29+/-0.06; SA: 0.32+/-0.04, 0.18+/-0.05; TM: 0.25+/-0.03, 0.15+/-0.03). mRNA levels of TGF-beta1 and IGF-I in the hypertrophic AS myocardium were greater (P=.02, P=.05) than those in the explanted myocardium (TM). Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies showed increased expression of TGF-beta1 and IGF-I in the HCM cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression of TGF-beta1 and IGF-I was enhanced in idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and may be associated with its development.
11435794	Increased expression of transforming growth factor-beta after cerebral ischemia in the baboon: an endogenous marker of neuronal stress?	There has been an increasing interest in recent years in the evaluation of the neuronal and glial responses to ischemic insult. Some cytokines, including transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), that are overexpressed after experimental stroke in rodents are thought to be implicated in the neuronal processes that lead to necrosis. Thus, such cytokines could predict tissue fate after stroke in humans, although data are currently sparse for gyrencephalic species. The current study addressed the expression pattern of TGF-beta1 in a nonhuman primate model of middle cerebral artery occlusion. Focal permanent ischemia was induced for 1 or 7 days in 6 baboons and the following investigations were undertaken: cerebral oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) positron emission tomography studies, magnetic resonance imaging, postmortem histology, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The aim of the current study was to correlate the expression of TGF-beta1 to the underlying metabolic and histologic state of the threatened cerebral parenchyma. The authors evidenced increased TGF-beta1 mRNA levels (up to 25-fold) in those regions displaying a moderate (20% to 49%) reduction in CMRO2. The current findings suggest that the greatly enhanced expression of TGF-beta1 in the penumbral zones that surround tissue destined to infarction may represent a robust index of potentially salvageable brain. The current investigation, in the nonhuman primate, strengthens the authors' hypothesis, derived from rodent models, that TGF-beta1 may be involved in the physiopathology of human stroke.
12020749	Sustained expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 by distraction during distraction osteogenesis.	Distraction osteogenesis is a well-established clinical treatment for limb length discrepancy and skeletal deformities. In our previous studies, we have shown that the tension at the distraction gap correlated with the plasma bone specific alkaline phosphatase activity during distraction. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) has been shown to have a regulatory role in alkaline phosphatase activity during fracture healing. This study is to investigate the expression of TGF-beta1 during distraction as a biological response to mechanically stimulated osteoblastic activity by immunohistochemistry. The expression of TGF-beta1 in the distraction callus was compared with that in the fracture callus. During the distraction phase, the osteoblasts and osteocytes expressed a high level of TGF-beta1. Moderate expression of TGF-beta1 was observed in fibroblast-like cells in the fibrous zone of the distraction callus. After the distraction stopped, the expression of TGF-beta1 in different cell types decreased. In fracture healing, the strong expression of TGF-beta1 declined after the first week. Our results showed that the mechanical force induced and sustained TGF-beta1 expression in osteoblasts and fibroblasts-like cells of the distraction callus. Transforming growth factor-beta1 may play a role in transducing mechanical stimulation to biological tissue during in distraction osteogenesis.
9345022	Transforming growth factor-beta1 abrogates Fas-induced growth suppression and apoptosis of murine bone marrow progenitor cells.	Fas, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF ) receptor superfamily is a critical downregulator of cellular immune responses. Proinflammatory cytokines like interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and TNF-alpha can induce Fas expression and render hematopoietic progenitor cells susceptible to Fas-induced growth suppression and apoptosis. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1 ) is an essential anti-inflammatory cytokine, thought to play a key role in regulating hematopoiesis. In the present studies we investigated whether TGF-beta1 might regulate growth suppression and apoptosis of murine hematopoietic progenitor cells signaled through Fas. In the presence of TNF, activation of Fas almost completely blocked clonogenic growth of lineage-depleted (Lin-) bone marrow (BM) progenitor cells in response to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF ), CSF-1, or a combination of multiple cytokines. Whereas TGF-beta1 alone had no effect or stimulated growth in response to these cytokines, it abrogated Fas-induced growth suppression. Single-cell studies and delayed addition of TGF-beta1 showed that the ability of TGF-beta1 to inhibit Fas-induced growth suppression was directly mediated on the progenitor cells and not indirect through potentially contaminating accessory cells. Furthermore, TGF-beta1 blocked Fas-induced apoptosis of Lin- BM cells, but did not affect Fas-induced apoptosis of thymocytes. TGF-beta1 also downregulated the expression of Fas on Lin- BM cells. Thus, TGF-beta1 potently and directly inhibits activation-dependent and Fas-mediated growth suppression and apoptosis of murine BM progenitor cells, an effect that appears to be distinct from its ability to induce progenitor cell-cycle arrest. Consequently, TGF-beta1 might act to protect hematopoietic progenitor cells from enhanced Fas expression and function associated with proinflammatory responses.
11755001	Reactive astrocytes and alpha1-antichymotrypsin in Alzheimer's disease.	There is ample genetic, biochemical, cellular and molecular evidence to show that the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), a proteolytic fragment of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), plays an important, if not causative role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). An additional hallmark of AD is the neuroinflammatory response that is associated with the amyloid deposition. We discovered that the acute phase protein alpha1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) is overexpressed by reactive astrocytes, and is tightly associated with virtually all amyloid plaques in the AD brain. It has also been shown that Abeta and ACT bind in vitro. Recently, we have reported that astrocytic expression of ACT in APP transgenic mice leads to an increased plaque deposition in ACT/APP doubly transgenic mice compared to the APP mice alone, suggesting that ACT interferes with Abeta clearance. The main objective of this review is to summarize the role of astrocytosis and ACT in the pathogenesis of AD.
11799682	Mn2+ ions pass through Ca2+ channels in myoepithelial cells.	1. Intracellular recordings were made from the myoepithelial cells of the proventriculus of the marine polychaete worm Syllis spongiphila. Over-shooting responses were elicited either by carbamylcholine added to the bathing medium or by directly applied intracellular current pulses. 2. In control artificial sea water (ASW) directly applied current pulses elicited regenerative responses of 68-119 mV in amplitude and 70-1800 ms in duration; these responses were associated with contractions of the myoepithelial cells. 3. Both pharmacologically and electrically elicited responses were reversibly abolished in Ca-free ASW and were unaffected by TTX or low-sodium solutions. Regenerative responses were elicited by direct intracellular stimulation in calcium-free ASW containing 1 mM-Ba2+ or 10 mM-Sr2+. Directly elicited responses were blocked reversibly in ASW containing calcium and 15-20 mM-Co2+ or 2.5-10 mM-Ni2+; they were blocked irreversibly in ASW containing calcium and 10 mM-La3+ or 100 microM-Zn2+. 4. Regenerative responses were elicited in Ca-free solutions containing 10-50 mM-Mn2+; these responses were not associated with contractions, were consistently of longer duration than responses elicited in control ASW, and were blocked by 20 mM-Co2+ or 10 mM-La3+. The overshoots of Mn2+ responses elicited in both Na-free and Na-containing, Ca-free solutions increased as the external concentration of Mn2+ was increased, with a slope of about 27 mV per 10-fold change in concentration of Mn2+. In Ca-containing solutions the slope was reduced to about 15 mV per 10-fold change. 5. The results indicate that the myoepithelial cells generate Ca-spikes and that Mn2+ ions, in addition to Sr2+ and Ba2+ ions, pass through the Ca2+ channels of the myoepithelial cell membranes. Although Mn2+ can replace Ca2+ in generating spikes, it apparently cannot replace Ca2+ in initiating contraction, and it many compete with Ca2+ in activating repolarization of the cell.
12557755	Serial CT and MRI findings in a patient with isolated angiitis of the central nervous system associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy.	We report serial CT and MRI findings in a biopsy-proven case of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) with isolated angiitis of the central nervous system (CNS). A 69-year-old man had developed dizziness, dementia, and generalized seizure during the preceding 4 years. An initial examination by brain CT and MRI showed bilateral symmetrical periventricular lesions closely resembling those of Binswanger's disease. Subsequently, the lesions expanded slowly, involving a large area of the right cerebral hemisphere with an obvious mass effect. Since a primary brain tumor was suspected, a brain biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination revealed amyloid beta protein CAA within the meningocortical vessels associated with perivascular monocytic cuffing, indicating the presence of isolated angiitis of the CNS. Multinucleated giant cells containing intracytoplasmic beta protein amyloid around a heavily amyloid-laden cortical vessel were also observed. This is the first case report to show sequential radiographical studies of the leukoencephalopathy associated with CAA and isolated angiitis of the CNS.
9541223	Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in dentine matrix. Ligand activation and receptor expression.	Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-beta) and other members of this family of growth factors have been implicated in tooth development and dental tissue repair. This study aimed to investigate regulatory factors for TGF-beta1 in rabbit incisor dentine matrix and the expression of receptors for TGF-beta in dental tissues better to understand the control of its biological activity. Approximately half of the TGF-beta1 in dentine matrix was present in active form. TGF-beta1 was found in association with latency associated peptide (LAP), betaglycan and decorin in an isolated dentine matrix preparation. Immunohistochemistry showed strong staining for TGF-beta type I and II receptors in odontoblasts with more variable and weaker staining of other pulpal cells. Association of TGF-beta1 with betaglycan, decorin and LAP may regulate the availability and biological activity of this growth factor and influence its presentation to the TGF-beta type I and II receptors on odontoblasts. During dental tissue repair, such control processes will be important in regulating the biological effects of TGF-beta1 on cells of the dentine-pulp complex.
10611368	Apolipoprotein E is essential for amyloid deposition in the APP(V717F) transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.	We quantified the amount of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) immunoreactivity as well as amyloid deposits in a large cohort of transgenic mice overexpressing the V717F human amyloid precursor protein (APP(V717F+/-) TG mice) with no, one, or two mouse apolipoprotein E (Apoe) alleles at various ages. Remarkably, no amyloid deposits were found in any brain region of APP(V717F+/-) Apoe(-/-) TG mice as old as 22 mo of age, whereas age-matched APP(V717F +/-) Apoe(+/-) and Apoe(+/+) TG mice display abundant amyloid deposition. The amount of Abeta immunoreactivity in the hippocampus was also markedly reduced in an Apoe gene dose-dependent manner (Apoe(+/+) > Apoe(+/-) >> Apoe(-/-)), and no Abeta immunoreactivity was detected in the cerebral cortex of APP(V717F+/-) Apoe(-/-) TG mice at any of the time points examined. The absence of apolipoprotein E protein (apoE) dramatically reduced the amount of both Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) immunoreactive deposits as well as the resulting astrogliosis and microgliosis normally observed in APP(V717F) TG mice. ApoE immunoreactivity was detected in a subset of Abeta immunoreactive deposits and in virtually all thioflavine-S-fluorescent amyloid deposits. Because the absence of apoE alters neither the transcription or translation of the APP(V717F) transgene nor its processing to Abeta peptide(s), we postulate that apoE promotes both the deposition and fibrillization of Abeta, ultimately affecting clearance of protease-resistant Abeta/apoE aggregates. ApoE appears to play an essential role in amyloid deposition in brain, one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.
12732871	Gene transfer approaches for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.	The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease, involves a complex interplay between certain genetic, environmental and immunological factors. Considerable research progress in the last decade defined key inflammatory pathways in the inflamed gut and identified new potential therapeutic targets. Since the current medical treatment with corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory drugs is often associated with undesired side effects and cannot completely cure IBD, these current advances in our understanding of intestinal pathology may now allow the development of new biologic treatment strategies including gene therapy. In this review, we will give a brief overview of potential gene therapy target molecules related to chronic intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, we summarize the results of recent preclinical studies for intestinal gene transfer and discuss future perspectives.
8737929	Prion protein amyloidosis.	"The prion protein (PrP) plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of a group of sporadic, genetically determined and infectious fatal degenerative diseases, referred to as ""prion diseases"", affecting the central nervous system of humans and other mammals. The cellular PrP is encoded by a single copy gene, highly conserved across mammalian species. In prion diseases, PrP undergoes conformational changes involving a shift from alpha-helix to beta-sheet structure. This conversion is important for PrP amyloidogenesis, which occurs to the highest degree in the genetically determined Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease (GSS) and prion protein cerebral amyloid angiopathy (PrP-CAA), while it is less frequently seen in other prion diseases. GSS and PrP-CAA are associated with point mutations of the prion protein gene (PRNP); these conditions show a broad spectrum of clinical presentation, the main signs being ataxia, spastic paraparesis, extrapyramidal signs and dementia. In GSS, parenchymal amyloid may be associated with spongiform changes or neurofibrillary lesions; in PrP-CAA, vascular amyloid is associated with neurofibrillary lesions. A major component of the amyloid fibrils in the two diseases is a 7 kDa peptide, spanning residues 81-150 of PrP."
10922969	Growth factors, cytokines, and renal fibrosis during the course of diabetic nephropathy.	Diabetic nephropathy is characterised by a progressive accumulation of extracellular matrix within the glomerular mesangium and the interstitium. The pathogenesis of this fibrotic process is still poorly understood, but in vitro and in vivo data suggest that TGF-B plays a key role. Local overproduction of TGF-B could be secondary to a synthesis of diacylglycerol, polyols, or glucosamines. It may also be secondary to an accumulation of advanced glycosylation end-products which modify the functions of neighbouring cells. Moreover, clinical as well as experimental data for TGF-B suggest that angiotensin II has a profibrotic effect; and it has been clearly demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have a beneficial effect in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Other molecules such as endothelin-1, lipid peroxidation products, or IGF-1 may also play a role in this fibrotic process. Finally, heavy proteinuria secondary to glomerular lesions enhances the accumulation of extracellular matrix within the interstitium, probably through modifications of tubular cell functions, thereby inducing the release of pro-inflammatory and profibrotic molecules.
10926948	Serial measurement of vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta1 in serum of patients with acute ischemic stroke.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) are expressed in higher than normal concentrations in the penumbra of patients after ischemic stroke. Because both cytokines are central to the processes of angiogenesis, tissue inflammation, and fibrosis, we performed serial measurements of these cytokines in patients with cerebral infarction and determined their relationship to stroke etiology and volume. METHODS: We serially (at days 0, 1, 3, 7, and 14) measured the serum levels of VEGF and active TGF-beta1 in 29 patients with acute ischemic stroke. Age-matched healthy subjects (n=26) were used as controls. RESULTS: Expression of VEGF was significantly increased in the majority of patients after acute stroke at each of the time points compared with normal controls. Highest expression occurred at day 7 (588+/-121 pg/mL; P=0.005), and it remained significantly elevated at 14 days after stroke. Expression of VEGF correlated with infarct volume, clinical disability (Scandinavian Stroke Scale), and peripheral leukocytosis and was significantly higher in patients with atherothrombotic large-vessel disease and ischemic heart disease (P<0.05 in all cases). In contrast, expression of active TGF-beta1 was not significantly different from control patients at any of the measured time points. When the mean concentration of TGF-beta1 from each patient (pooled time points) was compared with the control mean, a significant increase was found in only 2 patients, whereas levels decreased in 12 patients (P<0.05). There was no correlation between circulating active TGF-beta1 and VEGF expression, leukocytosis, stroke subtype, or patient disability as assessed by Scandinavian Stroke Scale score. CONCLUSIONS: VEGF but not TGF-beta1 showed a dramatic increase in serum of stroke patients. Correlation between stroke severity and VEGF concentration suggests it could be involved in the subsequent repair processes resulting in partial recovery after stroke. Correlation between VEGF expression and peripheral leukocytosis suggests that these changes may also reflect the immunologic status of the patient. VEGF may play an important role in the pathophysiology of acute ischemic stroke and could be of value in future treatment strategies.
12032592	Association of a polymorphism of the transforming growth factor-beta1 gene with blood pressure in Japanese individuals.	Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is an important regulator of blood pressure (BP) and vascular remodeling, and thus may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension. A T-->C transition at nucleotide 869 of the TGF-beta1 gene results in a Leu-->Pro substitution at amino acid 10 of the signal peptide. We have now examined the possible association of the 869T-->C polymorphism of the TGF-beta1 gene with BP and the prevalence of hypertension in 2241 community-dwelling Japanese individuals (1126 men and 1115 women). TGF-beta1 genotype was determined by an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction method. For women, both systolic and diastolic BP was significantly higher in individuals with the CC genotype than in those with the TT or TC genotype. No significant association between TGF-beta1 genotype and BP was detected in men. The frequency of the CC genotype was significantly higher in women with hypertension than in those with normal BP. These results suggest that the TGF-beta1 gene at chromosome 19q13.1 may be a candidate susceptibility locus for hypertension in Japanese women.
7843149	Use of body mass index in the assessment of adult nutritional status in Vietnam.	The authors have used body mass index (BMI: kg/m2) to assess the Vietnamese adult nutritional status and classified the population into different grades of chronic energy deficiency (CED). CED is prevalent in Vietnamese adults (average 40%). The mean value of BMI of the age group 26-40 years is 19.7 but it decreases thereafter except in urban areas. The BMI curve of distribution is different between adults living in rural, urban and mountainous areas. There seems to be a relation between BMI of mothers and the nutritional status of their < 5-year-old children. The survey also revealed a relation between maternal BMI and birth weight, and between CED and the health status of the population.
8649554	Cerebral amyloid angiopathy in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease: the CERAD experience, Part XV.	We studied the frequency, severity, and clinical correlations of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in 117 CERAD subjects with autopsy-confirmed AD. Eighty-three percent showed at least a mild degree of amyloid angiopathy. Thirty of 117 brains (25.6%) showed moderate to severe CAA affecting the cerebral vessels in one or more cortical regions. These brains also showed a significantly higher frequency of hemorrhages or ischemic lesions than those of subjects with little or no amyloid angiopathy (43.3% versus 23.0%; odds ratio = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.1 to 6.2) High CAA scores also correlated with the presence of cerebral arteriosclerosis and with older age at onset of dementia. Our findings suggest that factors contributing to non-AD-related vascular pathology (e.g., atherosclerosis) may play a role in amyloid deposition in cerebral vessels in AD.
9227694	Diagnosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Sensitivity and specificity of cortical biopsy.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Examination of cortical tissue obtained surgically is an important tool for diagnosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) during life. Analysis of a single sample of cortical tissue, however, might lead to conclusions that are either falsely positive (because of the high frequency of CAA in the healthy elderly) or falsely negative (because of the patchy distribution of CAA pathology). We therefore attempted to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of cortical biopsy for diagnosis of CAA as the cause of intracerebral hemorrhage. METHODS: To simulate biopsy in CAA, we took biopsy-sized cortical samples from postmortem brains with known extents of CAA: either CAA-related hemorrhage or mild to severe CAA without hemorrhage. Samples were stained with the use of methods routinely available in surgical pathology laboratories and blindly examined for vascular amyloid and amyloid-related vasculopathic changes. RESULTS: The presence of vascular amyloid was a sensitive marker for CAA-related hemorrhage, occurring in all 28 specimens from brains with hemorrhage. Conversely, the appearance of fibrinoid necrosis in amyloid-laden vessels was relatively specific for CAA-related hemorrhage. This finding occurred in 13 of the 28 specimens (46%) from brains with hemorrhage but in none of 27 sections from brains with mild CAA and in only 4 of 42 specimens with moderate to severe CAA without hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: These data help to define criteria for the diagnosis of CAA-related hemorrhage from surgical specimens.
9600229	Progression of cerebral amyloid angiopathy: accumulation of amyloid-beta40 in affected vessels.	"Cerebrovascular deposits of amyloid (cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or CAA) are generally asymptomatic, but in advanced cases, they can lead to vessel rupture and hemorrhage. The process of progression in CAA was studied by comparison of postmortem brains with asymptomatic (""mild"") CAA to brains with the form of the disease associated with hemorrhage (""severe CAA""). Cortical and meningeal vessels were immunostained for beta-amyloid and examined by confocal microscopy and by systematic quantitative sampling. We focused on 2 quantitative parameters: the proportion of vessels affected by amyloid (a measure of amyloid seeding of vessels) and the amount of amyloid per affected vessel (a measure of growth of existing lesions). Surprisingly, there was no difference between the proportion of affected cortical vessels in mild and severe CAA (0.29 vs 0.32, p = 0.65), but rather an increase in the area of the 40 amino acid form of beta-amyloid per affected cortical vessel (198.5 +/- 38.7 vs 455.8 +/- 100.9 microm2/vessel, p < 0.007). Increasing doses (from 0 to 1 to 2 copies) of the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele were also associated with greater amyloid per vessel without change in the proportion of affected vessels within each class of CAA severity. These findings suggest that progression from asymptomatic to advanced CAA reflects progressive accumulation of amyloid in vessels previously seeded with amyloid, and that this process is selectively enhanced by apolipoprotein E epsilon4."
10825506	The expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in hippocampal neurons: a temporary upregulated protein level after transient forebrain ischemia in the rat.	Exogenous TGF-beta1 has been shown to protect neurons from damage induced in vitro and in vivo. In this study we attempted to examine the expression of endogenous TGF-beta1 mRNA and protein in the hippocampus of non-ischemic and ischemic rats, and to localize TGF-beta1 protein and DNA fragmentation by double-staining. Transient ischemia was induced for 10 min in Wistar rats by clamping both common carotid arteries and lowering blood pressure to 40 mmHg. Bioactive TGF-beta1 was selectively determined in CA1 pyramidal neurons of non-ischemic rats. It was upregulated after 3 h and 6 h of reperfusion corresponding to the increase in TGF-beta1 mRNA level detected by RT-PCR. Lectin and GFAP staining showed no detectable activated microglial cells and astrocytes in the hippocampus 3 h and 6 h after ischemia. When neuronal damage proceeded through day 2 to day 4 after ischemia as demonstrated by TUNEL-staining, TGF-beta1 immunoreactivity (ir) disappeared in damaged neurons but persisted in viable neurons although TGF-beta1 mRNA levels continuously increased. Double-staining revealed that TUNEL-positive neurons did not express TGF-beta1, while TUNEL-negative neurons in the CA1 subfield exhibited a distinct TGF-beta1 ir. These data indicate that hippocampal CA1 neurons can express TGF-beta1 under physiological conditions and upregulate its expression during the first hours after ischemia, that is independent of the activation of glial cells. The endogenous TGF-beta1 expressed in neurons may play a role in the pathological process of DNA degradation and delayed neuronal death after transient forebrain ischemia.
11052495	Increased matrix synthesis following adenoviral transfer of a transforming growth factor beta1 gene into articular chondrocytes.	Monolayer cultures of lapine articular chondrocytes were transduced with first-generation adenoviral vectors carrying lacZ or transforming growth factor beta1 genes under the transcriptional control of the human cytomegalovirus early promoter. High concentrations of transforming growth factor beta1 were produced by chondrocytes following transfer of the transforming growth factor beta1 gene but not the lacZ gene. Transduced chondrocytes responded to the elevated endogenous production of transforming growth factor beta1 by increasing their synthesis of proteoglycan, collagen, and noncollagenous proteins in a dose-dependent fashion. The increases in collagen synthesis were not accompanied by alterations in the collagen phenotype; type-II collagen remained the predominant collagen. Transforming growth factor beta1 could not, however, rescue the collagen phenotype of cells that had undergone phenotypic modulation as a result of serial passaging. These data demonstrate that chondrocytes can be genetically manipulated to produce and respond to the potentially therapeutic cytokine transforming growth factor beta1. This technology has a number of experimental and therapeutic applications, including those related to the study and treatment of arthritis and cartilage repair.
11571354	Downregulation of transforming growth factor-beta1 in interferon-beta1a-treated MS patients.	The authors report an intense downregulation of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) serum levels 4 weeks from start of interferon-beta1a (IFN-beta1a) treatment at 44 microg/week in 271 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, which was still present after 1 year (p < 0.001). In line with previous data, interleukin-10 serum levels did not vary significantly. These results indicate that the immunomodulatory effects of IFN-beta might not be restricted to the postulated anti-inflammatory mechanisms and address the role of TGF-beta in the pathogenesis of MS.
11761474	Dementia in hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type is associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy but is independent of plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.	Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is frequently found in demented and nondemented elderly persons, but its contribution to the causation of dementia is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the relation between the amount of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and the presence of dementia in 19 patients with hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type. The advantage of studying hereditary cerebral hemorrhage in amyloidosis-Dutch type is that patients with this disease consistently have severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy with minimal neurofibrillary pathology. The amount of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, as quantified by computerized morphometry, was strongly associated with the presence of dementia independent of neurofibrillary pathology, plaque density, or age. The number of cortical amyloid beta-laden severely stenotic vessels, vessel-within-vessel configurations, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy-associated microvasculopathies was associated with the amount of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and dementia. A semiquantitative score, based on the number of amyloid beta-laden severely stenotic vessels, completely separated demented from nondemented patients. These results suggest that extensive (more than 15 amyloid beta-laden severely stenotic vessels in five frontal cortical sections) cerebral amyloid angiopathy alone is sufficient to cause dementia in hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type. This may have implications for clinicopathological correlations in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias with cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
7628558	Fasciola hepatica: localisation of glutathione S-transferase isoenzymes in adult and juvenile liver fluke.	Four cDNA clones (GST-1, -7, -47, and -51) encoding isoenzymes of the detoxification enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST) have previously been identified and characterised from Fasciola hepatica. In the present study, antisera were generated to synthetic peptides of regions unique to each of the four GST proteins predicted by the cDNAs. The antisera were characterised, and two were found to distinguish GST-1 from GST-7, GST-47, and GST-51 as a group. These two antisera were used to localise different GSTs in adult and newly excysted juvenile F. hepatica. The antiserum to GST-1 was specific and localised GST-1 to the parenchyma of adult fluke but not to the lamellae of the intestinal caeca. The antiserum to a GST-51 peptide, which cross-reacted with GST-7 and GST-47 but not GST-1, localised the other GSTs not only to the parenchyma but also to the intestinal lamellae of adult fluke. This appears to be the first evidence of tissue-specific expression of GST isoenzymes in trematodes. In contrast to adult fluke, immunolocalisation of the GSTs in juvenile F. hepatica revealed the binding of both the GST-1 and GST-51 antisera to the parenchymal cytoplasm, to cytoplasmic extensions of the parenchyma cells in the subtegumental area, as well as the excretory ducts. No labeling was observed in the intestinal epithelium of the juvenile fluke. These results demonstrate that adult F. hepatica, in contrast to juvenile flukes, contain a GST, which is not GST-1, associated with the lamellae of the gut and suggest that GSTs in adult fluke may play a role in the absorptive function of the adult gut.
7898768	TIPP[psi], a highly selective delta ligand.	TIPP[psi] is a new delta-selective opioid peptide antagonist. In the current study, we have explored its selectivity against the mu and kappa receptor subtypes. Against [3H]DPDPE binding, TIPP[psi] is quite potent, with a Ki value of < 1 nM, confirming its potent activity at delta receptors. In contrast, its Ki values against mu 1, mu 2, kappa 1, kappa 2 and kappa 3 binding sites are all > 5 microM. DPDPE also is delta-selective. It labels delta sites > 25-fold more potently than mu 1 receptors and is even more selective against the other subtypes. However, this selectivity does not compare to the delta/mu 1 selectivity of TIPP[psi] which exceeds 15,000. This far higher selectivity, coupled with its antagonist properties, gives TIPP[psi] a number of advantages over previously reported delta-selective compounds. We have utilized these advantages to develop an improved mu 1 binding assay using TIPP[psi].
8749212	Hereditary breast cancer in Finnish women.	OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of hereditary breast cancer seen in one Finnish hospital and to study the characteristics of the disease. DESIGN: Retrospective questionnaire and study of Finnish Cancer Registry. SETTING: University hospital, Finland. SUBJECTS: All 669 patients operated on for breast cancer 1986-90. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Type of breast cancer and morbidity in hereditary compared with other forms of breast cancer. The definition of hereditary breast cancer requires that at least three first degree relatives, inclusive of the proband, have breast cancer. RESULTS: Of the 669 patients 495 answered the questionnaire. Ten patients (2%) were classified as having hereditary breast cancer. The remaining 485 patients had other types of breast cancer by definition. Of those that were not hereditary 89 (18%) were classified as having familial breast cancer. Of the 495 patients 396 (80%) were classified as sporadic. The mean age of the patients at onset of the disease was 56 years in the hereditary group, 55 years in the familial group, and 57 years in the sporadic group. One patient (10%) in the hereditary, five (6%) in the familial, and 17 patients (4%) in the sporadic group had bilateral disease. Ductal carcinoma was most common in all groups of patients with breast cancer. CONCLUSION: There were no statistical differences in this series in the age at onset, incidence of bilateral disease, stage, and histopathology among the groups, although bilateral and lobular cancer were seen more often in the group with hereditary breast cancer.
9679567	Allelic deletion at glutathione S-transferase M1 locus and its association with breast cancer susceptibility.	Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of isoenzymes involved in cellular detoxification. Previous studies have correlated the absence of the GSTM1 protein with an increased risk of developing some cancers, especially lung or bladder cancer, in heavy smokers. In this study, we determined GSTM1 gene polymorphisms in a French western population of 437 female controls and 361 community breast cancer patients. Three distinct alleles of this gene may be identified: GST M1* A allele, GST M1* B allele, and GST M1* 0 allele (which is deleted). Null patients (GSTM1 0) are homozygous for the deletion. We determined in our two populations, patients with no, one or two GSTM1 alleles. The comparative analysis of our two populations did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference in GSTM1 allelotype distribution between the two groups (P = 0.43), although the null genotype was the more frequent in patients. The predominance of the null genotype was significant in the oldest group of patients (> or = 55) (P = 0.006), suggesting that GSTM1 null genotype may play an important role in breast cancer susceptibility in the elderly. This was not observed in the youngest age group, i.e. < 40 year old patients (P = 0.25), or in the patients aged from 40 to 55 years old (P = 0.37). Our results also point out a putative protective role of the A allele in the older female control group (P = 0.02), especially in subjects hemizygous for these alleles (P = 0.03). A prospective study will be of interest to investigate the effect of dosage of the gene.
9679751	Combined effect of polymorphic GST genes on individual susceptibility to lung cancer.	Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are known to take part in detoxification of many potentially carcinogenic compounds. Therefore, polymorphisms of the GST genes have been considered as potentially important modifiers of individual risk of environmentally induced cancers. The association between lack of glutathione S-transferase M1 gene (GSTM1 null genotype) and susceptibility to smoking-related lung cancer has been actively studied, with contradictory results. In contrast, little is known about the more recently found polymorphisms in GSTM3, GSTP1 and GSTT1 genes with respect to individual responses to environmental exposures. In this study, we determined the genotype distribution of all these genes, and their combinations, among 208 Finnish lung cancer patients and 294 population controls. None of the genotypes studied had a statistically significant effect on lung cancer risk, when studied separately. However, a significant association was observed for concurrent lack of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes and susceptibility to squamous cell carcinoma. For that cell type, the risk was more than 2-fold when compared with that of individuals having other genotype combinations (OR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.0-5.3; p = 0.05). Moreover, the risk was mostly attributable to patients with smoking history of 40 pack-years or less (OR = 2.9; 95% CI = 1.1-7.7; p = 0.03). In contrast, this genotype combination did not affect the risk for other histological types of lung cancer, and the other genotype combinations had no effects on individual susceptibility to this malignancy. The overall role of GST polymorphisms in modifying the lung cancer risk may therefore be more limited than has been so far anticipated.
10023062	Glutathione S-transferase M1 genotype influences sister chromatid exchange induction but not adaptive response in human lymphocytes treated with 1,2-epoxy-3-butene.	Induction of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) by 1,2-epoxy-3-butene (monoepoxybutene, MEB), an epoxide metabolite of 1,3-butadiene, in human whole-blood lymphocyte cultures has previously been observed to depend on the glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) and T1 (GSTT1) genotype of the blood donor. Pretreatment of lymphocyte cultures with a low dose of MEB has been shown to reduce the SCE response obtained by later treatment with a higher concentration of MEB. To investigate whether this adaptive response depends on the GSTM1 genotype of the donor, SCE induction by MEB (25 and 250 microM at 48 h for 24 h) was studied from whole-blood lymphocyte cultures of young non-smoking male and female subjects representing GSTM1 positive (n=7) and null (n=7) genotypes, with or without a MEB pretreatment (12.5 microM at 24 h). A higher mean number of induced SCEs per cell at 250 microM MEB was observed in lymphocytes of the GSTM1 null than positive donors, a statistically significant difference being obtained in the presence of the adaptive treatment (9.44 vs. 6.56; results from ethanol-treated controls subtracted). The pretreatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the response of the GSTM1 null group at both concentrations of MEB and in the GSTM1 positive group at 250 microM. However, there were no statistically significant differences in the adaptive response of the two genotypes. In conclusion, the present study further supported earlier findings on an increased sensitivity of GSTM1 null donors to SCE induction by MEB, suggesting that GSTM1 is involved in the detoxification of MEB in human lymphocyte cultures. As an adaptive response was observed in both GSTM1 positive and null donors, the phenomenon cannot be explained by GSTM1 induction. It may represent induction of other enzymes operating in MEB detoxification, or activation of DNA repair.
10667460	Genetic polymorphism of CYP genes, alone or in combination, as a risk modifier of tobacco-related cancers.	Tobacco use is causally associated with cancers of the lung, larynx, mouth, esophagus, kidneys, urinary tract, and possibly, breast. Major classes of carcinogens present in tobacco and tobacco smoke are converted into DNA-reactive metabolites by cytochrome P450 (CYP)-related enzymes, several of which display genetic polymorphism. Individual susceptibility to cancer is likely to be modified by the genotype for enzymes involved in the activation or detoxification of carcinogens in tobacco and repair of DNA damage. We summarize here the results of case-control studies published since 1990 on the effects of genetic variants of CYP1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2A6, 2D6, 2E1, 2C9, 2C19, 17, and 19 alone or in combination with detoxifying enzymes as modifiers of the risk for tobacco-related cancers. The results of studies on gene-gene interactions and the dependence of smoking-related DNA adducts on genotype were also analyzed. Some CYP variants were associated with increased risks for cancers of the lung, esophagus, and head and neck. The risk was often increased in individuals who also had GSTM1 deficiency. For breast cancer in women, a few studies suggested an association with CYPs related to metabolism of tobacco carcinogens and steroidal hormones. The overall effects of common CYP polymorphisms were found to be moderate in terms of penetrance and relative risk, with odds ratios ranging from 2 to 10. Some CYP1A1/GSTM1 0/0 genotype combinations seem to predispose the lung, esophagus, and oral cavity of smokers to an even higher risk for cancer or DNA damage, requiring, however, confirmation. Future strategies in molecular cancer epidemiology for identifying such susceptible individuals are discussed with emphasis on well-designed larger studies.
10862521	Alcohol consumption, glutathione S-transferase M1 and T1 genetic polymorphisms and breast cancer risk.	To evaluate the potential association between GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes and development of breast cancer, a hospital based case-control study was conducted in a South Korean study population consisting of 189 histologically confirmed incident breast cancer cases and their 189 age-matched control subjects with no present or previous history of cancer. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction method was used for the genotyping analyses and statistical evaluations were performed by unconditional logistic regression model. The GSTM1 null genotype was significantly associated with breast cancer risk in premenopausal women [odds ratio (OR) = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1-3.7], but not in the postmenopausal women (OR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.5-1.9), nor in all women grouped together (OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 0.8-1.1). The GSTT1 null genotype posed a similar risk of breast cancer with an OR of 1.6 (95% CI = 1.0-2.5) for the total breast cancer group, OR of 1.7 (95% CI = 0.9-3.2) for pre-menopausal women, and OR of 1.3 (95% CI = 0.6-2.8) for post-menopausal women. The breast cancer risk associated with concurrent lack of both GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes was 2.2 (95% CI = 1.1-4.5), and the risk increased as the number of null genotype increased (P for trend = 0.03). When the data were stratified by the known risk factors of breast cancer, a significant interaction was observed between the GSTM1 genotypes and alcohol consumption (P for interaction = 0.03). An especially remarkable risk of breast cancer was observed for alcohol-consuming premenopausal women lacking both the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes (OR = 5.3, 95% CI = 1.0-27.8) compared to those with both of the genes. Our findings thus suggest a novel gene-environment interaction which plays an important role in the individual susceptibility to breast cancer. p6
10868693	The glutathione S-transferase M1 genotype in ovarian cancer.	Glutathione S-transferase mu-1 (GSTM1) is a polymorphic member of the mu class gene family of the glutathione S-transferases. Individuals who are GSTM1 null have increased susceptibility to lung and colon cancer. We hypothesized that: (a) GSTM1 null individuals might also be at increased risk for development of ovarian cancer; and (b) the GSTM1 genotype would influence response to chemotherapy. One hundred and forty-six individuals with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer were genotyped using a three-primer PCR reaction specific for the GSTM1 gene and an internal control glutathione S-transferase mu-4 (GSTM4). The products were analyzed on agarose gels. Healthy individuals without a family history of ovarian, breast, or colon cancer served as unmatched controls (n = 80). The results show that age at diagnosis, histological type, and stage of ovarian cancer were all independent of GSTM1 genotype. The frequency of the GSTM1 null genotype in the ovarian cancer cohort was similar to that in the control population, 51% versus 58%, P > 0.05. Likewise, median survival for individuals with advanced stage ovarian cancer was independent of GSTM1 genotype. We concluded that the GSTM1 null genotype does not increase ovarian cancer risk. These findings suggest that GSTM1 does not play a significant role in detoxifying environmental factors that influence ovarian carcinogenesis and does not play an important role in the resistance of ovarian cancer to chemotherapy.
11106587	Development of spontaneous mammary tumors in BALB/c p53 heterozygous mice. A model for Li-Fraumeni syndrome.	Breast cancer is the most frequent tumor type among women in the United States and in individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The p53 tumor suppressor gene is altered in a large proportion of both spontaneous breast malignancies and Li-Fraumeni breast cancers. This suggests that loss of p53 can accelerate breast tumorigenesis, yet p53-deficient mice rarely develop mammary tumors. To evaluate the effect of p53 loss on mammary tumor formation, the p53(null) allele was back-crossed onto the BALB/c genetic background. Median survival was 15.4 weeks for BALB/c-p53(-/-) mice compared to 54 weeks for BALB/c-p53(+/-) mice. Sarcomas and lymphomas were the most frequent tumor types in BALB/c-p53(-/-) mice, whereas 55% of the female BALB/c-p53(+/-) mice developed mammary carcinomas. The mammary tumors were highly aneuploid, frequently lost the remaining wild-type p53 allele, but rarely lost BRCA1. Although mammary tumors were rarely detected in BALB/c-p53(-/-) female mice, when glands from BALB/c-p53(-/-) mice were transplanted into wild-type BALB/c hosts, 75% developed mammary tumors. The high rate of mammary tumor development in the BALB/c background, but not C57Bl/6 or 129/Sv, suggests a genetic predisposition toward mammary tumorigenesis. Therefore, the BALB/c-p53(+/-) mice provide a unique model for the study of breast cancer in Li-Fraumeni syndrome. These results demonstrate the critical role that the p53 tumor suppressor gene plays in preventing tumorigenesis in the mammary gland.
11471167	Analysis of the EPHX1 113 polymorphism and GSTM1 homozygous null polymorphism and oral clefting associated with maternal smoking.	Maternal cigarette smoking during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of having a child with an oral cleft. Compounds present in cigarette smoke undergo bioactivation and/or detoxication. Phase I of this process results in the formation of reactive epoxides, which can form DNA adducts initiating and promoting mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, or teratogenesis. Microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH; gene symbol EPHX1) catalyzes hydrolysis of epoxides. Phase II involves attachment of a moiety (e.g., glutathione) to the compound mediated by a variety of enzymes, including glutathione S-transferase, generally resulting in a decreased reactivity. Recent studies suggest an association between the EPHX1 codon 113 polymorphism or homozygous null GSTM1 allele and the risk of carcinogenesis, emphysema, phenytoin-associated oral clefting, and the risk of spontaneous abortion. This study explores the association between EPHX1 codon 113 and homozygous null GSTM1 genotypes and oral clefting among infants whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. Case infants were diagnosed with isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P). EPHX1 codon 113 allelotyping was performed on 195 samples (85 cases, 110 controls) by PCR/RFLP analysis. 130 samples (79 cases, 51 controls) were tested for the GSTM1 homozygous null genotype using PCR. Using the odds ratio as a measure of association, we did not observe elevated risks of CL/P associated with either allelic comparison. This suggests that when mothers smoke periconceptionally, their infants having these alleles at either (or both) loci were not at substantially increased risk for CL/P compared to infants with the wild-type alleles.
11585745	Polymorphisms in glutathione S-transferases (GSTM1 and GSTT1) and survival after treatment for breast cancer.	The response to treatment for breast cancer is likely predicted by a number of disease and tumor tissue characteristics, many of which are under active investigation. One area that has received little attention is that of endogenous capabilities to respond to reactive oxygen species and subsequent byproducts resulting from radiation therapy and a number of chemotherapeutic agents, preventing cytotoxicity toward tumor cells. The glutathione S-transferases are key conjugating enzymes in this response, and GSTM1 and GSTT1 have deletion polymorphisms that result in no enzyme activity. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the role of GSTM1- and GSTT1-null genotypes on disease-free and overall survival among 251 women who received treatment for incident, primary breast cancer. Women were identified through Tumor Registry records and normal archived tissue retrieved for genotyping. Adjusting for age, race, and stage at diagnosis, women with null genotypes for GSTM1 and GSTT1 had reduced hazard of death [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 0.59; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.36-0.97; and HR, 0.51; CI, 0.29-0.90, respectively] in relation to those with alleles present. Furthermore, women who were null for both GSTM1 and GSTT1 had one-third the hazard of death of those with alleles for both genes present (adjusted HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11-0.70). Similar relationships were noted for risk of recurrence. These data indicate that interindividual differences in activity of enzymes that prevent therapy-generated reactive oxidant damage may have an important impact on disease recurrence and overall survival.
11731429	Sensitivity to benzo(a)pyrene diol-epoxide associated with risk of breast cancer in young women and modulation by glutathione S-transferase polymorphisms: a case-control study.	Mounting epidemiological evidence suggests that smoking may play a role in the etiology of breast cancer. Because smoking-related DNA adducts are detectable in both normal and malignant breast tissues, we hypothesized that breast cancer patients may be sensitive to tobacco-induced carcinogenesis, and this sensitivity could be modulated by variants of metabolic genes. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated benzo(a)pyrene diol-epoxide (BPDE)-induced mutagen sensitivity and polymorphisms of GSTM1 and GSTT1 in a pilot case-control study of breast cancer. Short-term cell cultures were established from blood samples of 100 female breast cancer patients and 105 healthy controls. After 5 h of in vitro exposure to 4 microM of BPDE, we harvested the lymphocytes for cytogenetic evaluation and recorded and compared the frequency of BPDE-induced chromatid breaks between cases and controls. We used a multiplex PCR-based assay to simultaneously detect polymorphisms of GSTM1 and GSTT1 from genomic DNA. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses and calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Cases had a significantly higher frequency of chromatid breaks than did controls (P < 0.0001). The level of chromatid breaks greater than the median value of controls was associated with a >3-fold increased risk of breast cancer [adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) = 3.11; 95% CI = 1.72-5.64]. The risk was more pronounced in those who were < 45 years (ORadj = 4.79; 95% CI = 1.87-12.3), ever-smokers (ORadj = 5.55; 95% CI = 1.85-16.6), alcohol drinkers (ORadj = 4.64; 95% CI = 1.70-12.7), and those who had the GSTT1 null variant (ORadj = 8.01; 95% CI = 1.16-55.3). These data suggest that sensitivity to BPDE-induced chromosomal aberrations may contribute to the risk of developing breast cancer, and such sensitivity may be modulated by both genetic and environmental factors. Larger studies are needed to confirm our findings.
11921190	Molecular epidemiologic studies of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-DNA adducts and breast cancer.	We review our studies on the role of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-DNA adducts in breast cancer. Additionally we report on analyses of the reliability of the scoring procedures used with immunohistochemical assay for PAH-DNA adducts and of potential bias arising from the use of benign breast disease (BBD) controls. We conducted a case-control study utilizing two control groups: BBD controls who donated tissue and blood samples, and healthy controls who donated blood samples. In comparisons of tumor tissue from cases and benign tissue from BBD controls, increasing adduct levels were significantly associated with case-control status [odds ratio (OR) = 2.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-4.92], whereas in comparisons of nontumor tissue from cases and benign tissue from BBD controls the association was nonsignificant (OR = 1.97, 95% CI 0.94-4.17). We also show among cases, but not among BBD controls, that the GSTM1 null genotype is associated with increased adduct levels in breast tissue. Our reliability study found the scoring procedures used with the immunohistochemical assay to have high reliability, 0.93 in nontumor, 0.82 in tumor, and 0.74 in benign tissues. However, we found that the technician significantly contributed to the total variability of a series of data. Finally, we did not find a consistent bias to the null associated with the use of BBD controls; however, BBD controls may overestimate the prevalence of family history of breast cancer compared to that of healthy controls (18% vs.14%). We hypothesize that the higher prevalence results from a referral bias and discuss how this may influence our results.
12542972	Genetic polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility of breast cancer in Korean women.	Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women in Western countries, and its prevalence is also increasing in Asia. The major risk factor for breast cancer can be traced to reproductive events that influence the lifetime levels of hormones. However, a large percentage of breast cancer cases cannot, be explained by these risk factors. The identification of susceptibility factors that predispose individuals to breast cancer (for instance, if they are exposed to particular environmental agents) could possibly give further insight into the etiology of this malignancy and provide targets for the future development of therapeutics. The most interesting candidate genes include those that mediate a range of functions. These include carcinogen metabolism, DNA repair, steroid hormone metabolism, signal transduction, and cell cycle control. we conducted a hospital-based case-control study on South Korea to evaluate the potential modifying role of the genetic pollymprphisms of selected low penetrance gens that are involved carcinogen metabolisms (i.e., CYP1A1, CYP2E1, GSTM1/T1/P1, NAT1/2, etc.), estrogen synthesis and metabolism (i.e., CYP19, CYP17, CYP1B1, COMT, ER-alpha, etc.), DNA repair (i.e., XRCC1/3, ERCC2/4, ATM, AGT, etc.), and signal transduction as well as others (i.e., TGF- beta, IGF-1, TNF- beta, IL-1B, IL-1RN, etc.). We also took into account the potential interaction between these and the known risk factors of breast cancer. The results of selected genes will be presented in this mini-review.
12552971	Glutathione S-transferase (GST) polymorphisms as risk factors for cancer in a highly homogeneous population from southern Italy.	Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) is a phase II enzyme and catalyses reactions between glutathione and a variety of electrophilic compounds, including some environmental carcinogens. In man, at least 20 isoenzymatic forms of GST have been identified and many of them show genetically-based individual variability of enzyme activity. The GSTM1 and GSTT1 isoenzymes display several polymorphisms, including a homozygotic deletion, which have been associated with an increased risk for developing neoplastic diseases. There is geographical and ethnic variation in genotype frequencies for both genes. The available data suggest that cancer incidence varies amongst Italian regions, being higher in Northern that in Southern areas, though it is unknown whether this phenomenon is to be attributed to genetic and/or environmental factors. We performed a case-control study to evaluate the GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms in a series of cancer patients in Basilicata, a Southern Italian region, and in corresponding controls. The results obtained demonstrate that the occurrence of GST polymorphisms in the Basilicata population is not different from other Italian regions and suggest that the population attributable risk associated with these genotypes may be quite high. GSTM1 homozygous null genotype was associated with an increasing risk of cancer, especially in females. The strongest association was with colon and breast cancers. For the GSTT1 gene, the results obtained were suggestive of a decreased risk of cancer associated with the null genotype. Thus, similar studies on these and other susceptibility genes are warranted since they can help to identify susceptible subgroups of people who can be targeted for cancer prevention.
12888106	Molecular epidemiology of sporadic breast cancer. The role of polymorphic genes involved in oestrogen biosynthesis and metabolism.	The major known risk factors for female breast cancer are associated with prolonged exposure to increased levels of oestrogen. The predominant theory relates to effects of oestrogen on cell growth. Enhanced cell proliferation, induced either by endogenous or exogenous oestrogens, increases the number of cell divisions and thereby the possibility for mutation. However, current evidence also supports a role for oxidative metabolites, in particular catechol oestrogens, in the initiation of breast cancer. As observed in drug and chemical metabolism, there is considerable interindividual variability (polymorphism) in the conjugation pathways of both oestrogen and catechol oestrogens. These person-to-person differences, which are attributed to polymorphisms in the genes encoding for the respective enzymes, might define subpopulations of women with higher lifetime exposure to hormone-dependent growth promotion, or to cellular damage from particular oestrogens and/or oestrogen metabolites. Such variation could explain a portion of the cancer susceptibility associated with reproductive effects and hormone exposure. In this paper the potential role of polymorphic genes encoding for enzymes involved in oestrogen biosynthesis (CYP17, CYP19, and 17beta-HSD) and conversion of the oestrogen metabolites and their by-products (COMT, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, GSTM1, GSTM3, GSTP1, GSTT1 and MnSOD) in modulating individual susceptibility to breast cancer are reviewed. Although some of these low-penetrance genes appeared as good candidates for risk factors in the etiology of sporadic breast cancer, better designed and considerably larger studies than the majority of the studies conducted so far are evidently needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn.
14562023	Glutathione S-transferases (GSTT1 and GSTM1) gene deletions in Tunisians: susceptibility and prognostic implications in breast carcinoma.	Glutathione S-transferase Theta1 and Mu1 (GSTT1 and GSTM1) are involved in the metabolism and detoxification of a wide range of potential environmental carcinogens. Conversely, they contribute to tumour cell survival by detoxification of numerous products induced by cancer therapy. The authors designed a large study to investigate the susceptibility and prognostic implications of the GSTT1 and GSTM1 gene deletions in breast carcinoma. The authors used the polymerase chain reaction to characterise the variation of the GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes in 309 unrelated Tunisian patients with breast carcinoma and 242 healthy control subjects. Associations of the clinic-pathologic parameters and the genetic markers with the rates of the breast carcinoma specific overall survival (OVS) and the disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses. A significant association was found between gene deletion of GSTT1 and the risk of early onset of breast carcinoma (OR=1.60, P=0.02). The lack of GSTT1 gene deletion was significantly associated with poor clinical response to chemotherapy (OR=2.29, P=0.03). This association was significantly higher in patients with axillary's lymph node-negative breast carcinoma (OR=12.60, P=0.005). The null-GSTT1 genotype showed a significant association with increased DFS in this selected population of patients. This association was even higher in patients carrying both null-GSTT1 and -GSTM1 genotypes. The gene deletion of GSTs may predict not only the early onset of breast carcinoma but also the clinical response to chemotherapy and the recurrence-free survival for patients with lymph node-negative breast carcinoma.
7627950	Cytochrome P4501A1 and glutathione S-transferase (M1) genetic polymorphisms and postmenopausal breast cancer risk.	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, possible human breast carcinogens, are metabolized by cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) and glutathione S-transferase (GSTM1). A CYP1A1 polymorphism (isoleucine to valine substitution in exon 7) or the null allele for GSTM1 may affect the mutagenic potential of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We examined polymorphisms in GSTM1 and CYP1A1 in relation to breast cancer risk. Included were 216 postmenopausal Caucasian women with incident breast cancer and 282 community controls. DNA analyses suggested no increased breast cancer risk with the null GSTM1 genotype [odds ratio (OR) = 1.10; CI, 0.73-1.64], although there was some indication that the null genotype was associated with risk among the youngest postmenopausal women (OR = 2.44; CI, 0.89-6.64). Slightly elevated risk was associated with the CYP1A1 polymorphism (OR = 1.61; CI, 0.94-2.75) and was highest for those who smoked up to 29 pack-years (OR = 5.22; CI, 1.16-23.56). Statistical power to detect an effect may be limited by small numbers, and larger sample sizes would be required to corroborate these suggestive findings.
7974294	Heterogeneous expression and polymorphic genotype of glutathione S-transferases in human lung.	BACKGROUND: Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics by conjugation with glutathione. One of the mu class genes of this superfamily of enzymes, GSTM1, is polymorphic because of a partial gene deletion. This results in a failure to express GSTM1 in approximately 50% of individuals. Several studies have linked GSTM1 null status to an increased risk of lung carcinoma. This study investigated the expression and distribution of GST isoenzymes in human lung, and developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay which would allow genotyping of archival, paraffin embedded lung tissue. METHODS: Distribution was examined using a panel of polyclonal anti-GST antibodies for immunohistochemistry in normal tissue of 21 tumour-bearing lungs. DNA for PCR was extracted from paraffin blocks and a control group of 350 blood lysates. As a positive control each assay amplified part of GSTM4, a mu class gene which is not polymorphic but which shows strong sequence homology to GSTM1. The presence of GST in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was sought by Western analysis. RESULTS: Proximal airways contained pi class GST, alpha class GST, and mu class GST with expression concentrated in the brush border. In distal airspaces no alpha GST was expressed but pi GST and mu GST were present in alveolar cells and also alveolar macrophages. Pi class GST was present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The PCR assay enabled genotypic determination using DNA extracted from archival material. Of the control group 56% were null at the GSTM1 locus. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of GST isoenzymes in the lung is heterogeneous with an apparent decrease in GST in distal lung. Since GSTM1 status has already been associated with susceptibility to disease, the PCR assay developed will allow further studies of the relation between genotype and structural disorders in the lung using archival pathological material.
8944071	Variability in loss of constitutional heterozygosity across loci and among individuals: association with candidate genes in ductal breast carcinoma.	Genes involved in the metabolic activation or detoxification of environmental carcinogens may contribute to breast cancer susceptibility by influencing rates of somatic mutation. To examine this hypothesis, we studied the association between loss of constitutional heterozygosity (LOH) in ductal breast tumors and allelic variability in genes that regulate the metabolism of environmental carcinogens. LOH was measured by typing the tumor and normal tissue of 28 breast cancer cases at 33 chromosomal loci by using highly polymorphic tetranucleotide repeat markers. Genotypes in non-tumor tissue were also measured at the cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), glutathione-s-transferase mu (GSTM), epoxide hydrolase (EH), and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) loci. The observed proportion of LOH was 11% overall and ranged from 0% to 37% across loci. LOH greater than 20% was observed on chromosomes 1p, 2p, 10q, 11q, 17p, and 18q. The observed proportion of LOH ranged from 0% to 67% among individuals. An elevated proportion of LOH was observed for genotypes at CYP2D6 (17% for the 1/1 and 1/2 genotypes vs 8% for the 2/ 2 genotype), NQO1 (13% for the 1/2 and 2/2 genotypes vs 8% for the 1/1 genotype), and GSTM (15% for the null genotype vs 7% for the wild-type genotype). No elevated proportion of LOH was observed for genotypes at CYP1A1 (12% for the 1/2 genotype vs 10% for the 1/1 genotype) or EH (11% for the 1/1 genotype vs 10% for the 1/2 genotype). There was no correlation of LOH with any other tumor characteristic such as estrogen- or progesterone-receptor status or number of positive lymph nodes. These results suggest that the proportion of LOH varies substantially across loci and among individuals. Interindividual variability in LOH may thus be explained in part by genes that regulate the metabolism of environmental carcinogens.
8959320	The glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) null genotype and benzidine-associated bladder cancer, urine mutagenicity, and exfoliated urothelial cell DNA adducts.	Multiple studies in the general population have suggested that subjects with the glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1)-null genotype, who lack functional GSTM1, are at higher risk for bladder cancer. To evaluate the impact of the GSTM1-null genotype on bladder cancer caused by occupational exposure to benzidine and to determine its influence on benzidine metabolism, we carried out three complementary investigations: a case-control study of bladder cancer among workers previously exposed to benzidine in China, a cross-sectional study of urothelial cell DNA adducts and urinary mutagenicity in workers currently exposed to benzidine in India, and a laboratory study of the ability of human GSTM1 to conjugate benzidine and its known metabolites in vitro. There was no overall increase in bladder cancer risk for the GSTM1-null genotype among 38 bladder cancer cases and 43 controls (odds ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.4-2.7), although there was some indication that highly exposed workers with the GSTM1-null genotype were at greater risk of bladder cancer compared to similarly exposed workers without this allele. However, the GSTM1 genotype had no impact on urothelial cell DNA adduct and urinary mutagenicity levels in workers currently exposed to benzidine. Furthermore, human GSTM1 did not conjugate benzidine or its metabolites. These results led us to conclude that the GSTM1-null genotype does not have an impact on bladder cancer caused by benzidine, providing a contrast to its association with elevated bladder cancer risk in the general population.
9180857	[Glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1): susceptibility gene of breast cancer].	Glutathione S-transferases mu (GSTM) are dimeric cytosolic isoenzymes. They catalyze glutathione conjugation upon a large variety of electrophiles as carcinogens, trans-stilbene peroxide or benzo(a)pyrene. The gene GSTM1 is localized on chromosome 1p13, it has drawn attention because it is absent approximately in 50% of the white population. GSTM1 null genotype seems linked with susceptibility to cancers as lung, colon and bladder cancers. We have studied GSTM1 genotype from 373 primary breast tumours. The GSTM1 null genotype was found in 50% of the cases (185/373). The incidence study of GSTM1 copy number on clinical and biological variables displayed a significant difference (p < 0.01) of the GSTM1 genotype, showed by the tumour, according to the patient age at diagnosis. The patients younger than 55 years had a percentage more important of primary tumours (65%) with a copy number of GSTM1 gene, inferior or equal at one, compared to the patients older than 55 years (52%). The tumours, whose cathepsin D level was high, presented few copies of GSTM1 gene (p < 0.03). There was no other relationship, particularly, with tumour size, node status, histological type, hormonal receptors, pS2 cytosolic level GSTM1 gene seems protect the mammary gland from cancerogenesis with its detoxification role. This results had not, pointed out in breast cancer, yet.
9209662	Breast cancer: pretreatment drug resistance parameters (GSH-system, ATase, P-glycoprotein) in tumor tissue and their correlation with clinical and prognostic characteristics.	BACKGROUND: The identification of new factors predicting relapse, outcome and response to systemic therapy in breast cancer is warranted. The measurement of biological markers such as drug resistance parameters (DRPs), which are part of the phenotype of malignant cells and contribute to resistance to anti-cancer drugs may be a possibility, which may ultimately lead to improvement of therapeutic results. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The level of glutathione (GSH), activities of glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione-peroxidase (GPx), 06-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase (ATase), and P-glycoprotein (PGP) were measured in tumor and adjacent tumor free tissue samples from 89 consecutive, untreated females with breast cancer and correlated with clinical and prognostic factors. Early breast cancer (EBC) was diagnosed in 56 patients, 22 patients had locally advanced (LABC) and 11 patients metastatic breast cancer. RESULTS: All DRPs showed significantly higher expression in tumor than in tumor free tissues. GPx was positively correlated with GST (r = 0.3, P = 0.0048) and with GSH (r = 0.5, P = 0.0001) in tumor as well as in normal tissue. GST activity was significantly higher in EBC than in LABC or metastatic breast cancer (P = 0.02). GSH level was significantly higher in grade 1 than in grade 2 or grade 3 tumors (P = 0.01). When clinical characteristics were related to the level of DRP, 'high' GSH was associated with age > 60 years (P = 0.01) in EBC, and with grade 1-2 tumors (P = 0.05) in LABC. No differences in OS were apparent between groups of 'high' and 'low' DRP-expression. However, the four-year estimated disease-free survival of EBC tended to be higher in patients with 'high' GST (P = 0.10) and of LABC in patients with 'high' GPx levels (P = 0.06). CONCLUSION: We conclude that 'high' levels of DRP in tumor tissue of breast cancer patients are part of the initial phenotype of the malignant cells. Due to its high prevalence (83% in EBC, 100% in primarily metastatic breast cancer), PGP did not add to prognostic information. High levels of GSH, GST and GPx were associated with favorable clinical characteristics and good prognosis, whereas low levels of GSH and GST activity were associated with more aggressive or more advanced disease.
9407957	An association between the allele coding for a low activity variant of catechol-O-methyltransferase and the risk for breast cancer.	Mounting evidence suggests that catechol metabolites of estradiol may contribute to the development of estrogen-induced cancers. O-Methylation, catalyzed by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), inactivates catechol estrogens. COMT is polymorphic in the human population, with 25% of Caucasians being homozygous for a low activity allele of the enzyme (COMT(LL)). We hypothesized that low activity COMT may be a risk factor for human breast cancer and designed a PCR-based RFLP assay to determine COMT genotype in a cohort of 112 matched, nested case-control samples. In the total study population, the odds ratios for the association of breast cancer risk with COMT(HL) and COMT(LL) genotypes were 1.30 [confidence interval (CI), 0.66-2.58] and 1.45 (CI, 0.69-3.07), respectively. Postmenopausal COMT(LL) women had a greater than 2-fold increased risk of developing breast cancer [odds ratio (OR), 2.18; CI, 0.93-5.11]. The association of COMT(LL) with the development of postmenopausal breast cancer was stronger and statistically significant in those women with a body mass index >24.47 kg/m2 (OR, 3.58; CI, 1.07-11.98). When COMT(LL) was combined with either glutathione S-transferase (GST) M1 null or with GSTP1 Ile-105-Val/Val-105-Val (intermediate/low activity, respectively) genotypes, the risk for developing postmenopausal breast cancer was also significantly increased. Our findings suggest that the allele encoding low activity COMT may be an important contributor to the postmenopausal development of breast cancer in certain women.
9539246	Association between glutathione S-transferase M1, P1, and T1 genetic polymorphisms and development of breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are encoded by a superfamily of genes and play a role in the detoxification of potential carcinogens. In a nested case-control study, we investigated associations between genetic variability in specific GST genes (GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1) and susceptibility to breast cancer. METHODS: In 1989, a total of 32 898 individuals donated blood samples to a research specimen bank established in Washington County, MD. Genotypes of blood specimen DNA were determined for 110 of 115 women with incident cases of breast cancer diagnosed during the period from 1990 through 1995 and up to 113 of 115 control subjects. Associations between specific genotypes and the development of breast cancer were examined by use of logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The GSTM1 homozygous null genotype was associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer (OR = 2.10; 95% CI = 1.22-3.64), principally due to an association with postmenopausal breast cancer (OR = 2.50; 95% CI = 1.34-4.65). For GSTP1, the data were suggestive of a trend of increasing risk with higher numbers of codon 105 valine alleles (compared with isoleucine alleles); a 1.97-fold increased risk of breast cancer (95% CI = 0.77-5.02) was associated with valine/valine homozygosity. The risk of breast cancer associated with the GSTT1 homozygous null genotype was 1.50 (95 % CI = 0.76-2.95). The risk of breast cancer increased as the number of putative high-risk genotypes increased (P for trend <.001) (OR = 3.77; 95% CI = 1.10-12.88 for a combined genotype of GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null, and either GSTP1 valine heterozygosity or GSTP1 valine homozygosity). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that genetic variability in members of the GST gene family may be associated with an increased susceptibility to breast cancer.
10064333	Glutathione-S-transferase (GSTM1) genetic polymorphisms do not affect human breast cancer risk, regardless of dietary antioxidants.	Glutathione-S-transferases catalyze the detoxication of carcinogen metabolites and reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced through a number of mechanisms. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) M1 is polymorphic, and the null allele results in a lack of enzyme activity. Because there are indications that ROS may be involved in breast carcinogenesis, we sought to determine whether the GSTM1 null allele was associated with increased breast cancer, particularly among women with lower consumption of dietary sources of alpha-tocopherol, carotenoids and ascorbic acid. In a study of diet and cancer in western New York, women with primary, incident, histologically confirmed breast cancer (n = 740) and community controls (n = 810) were interviewed and an extensive food-frequency questionnaire administered. A subset of these women provided a blood specimen. DNA was extracted and genotyping performed for GSTM1. Data were available for 279 cases and 340 controls. The null allele did not increase breast cancer risk, regardless of menopausal status. There were also no differences in associations between the polymorphism and risk among lower and higher consumers of dietary sources of antioxidants or smokers and nonsmokers. These results indicate that GSTM1 genetic polymorphisms are not associated with breast cancer risk, even in an environment low in antioxidant defenses.
10584720	Pregnancy and risk of early breast cancer in carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2.	BACKGROUND: Early age at first full-term pregnancy and increasing parity are associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. However, whether pregnancy decreases the risk of early-onset hereditary breast cancer is unknown. There is concern that pregnancy may increase breast-cancer risk in carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations. We aimed to establish whether pregnancy is a risk factor for hereditary breast cancer. METHODS: We did a matched case-control study of breast cancer in women who carry deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Cases were carriers who developed breast cancer by age 40 years, and controls were carriers of the same age without breast cancer, or who were diagnosed with breast cancer after age 40 years. Women who had undergone preventive mastectomy, hysterectomy, or oophorectomy, or who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer before the age at which breast cancer was diagnosed in the matched case were excluded. Information about pregnancies and pregnancy outcome was derived from a questionnaire completed by women in the course of genetic counselling. FINDINGS: A higher proportion of cases than controls had had a full term pregnancy (173/236 vs 146/236; odds ratio 1.71 [95% CI 1.13-2.62], p=0.01). The mean number of births was also greater for cases than for controls (1.62 vs 1.38, p=0.04). The risk increased with the number of births and did not diminish with time since last pregnancy. There were no significant differences in age at first birth or age at last birth between cases and controls. INTERPRETATION: Carriers of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations who have children are significantly more likely to develop breast cancer by age 40 than carriers who are nulliparous. Each pregnancy is associated with an increased cancer risk. An early first pregnancy does not confer protection for carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.
10797299	Prevalence of founder BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations among breast and ovarian cancer patients in Hungary.	We have investigated the impact of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations that were frequently identified among Hungarian high-risk breast-ovarian cancer families (Ramus et al., 1997b, AJHG), on the development of breast and ovarian cancer in the general Hungarian population. The prevalence of 3 BRCA1 mutations (185delAG, 300T-->G and 5382insC) and 2 BRCA2 mutations (6174delT and 9326insA) was evaluated in a hospital-based consecutive series of 500 female breast cancer patients and 90 ovarian cancer patients, not selected for age at diagnosis or family history of cancer, as well as in 350 controls. Among breast cancer patients, 3.6% (18/500) carried a founder mutation: 9 BRCA1 300T-->G, 7 BRCA1 5382insC, 1 BRCA1 185delAG and 1 BRCA2 9326insA. Among ovarian cancer patients, 11% (10/90) carried a founder mutation: 5 BRCA1 185delAG, 4 BRCA1 300T-->G and 1 BRCA1 5382insC. One control carried a mutation, BRCA1 5382insC. Inherited breast cancer was more frequent among women with younger age at diagnosis: 6.1% of women younger than age 50 but 2.4% of women diagnosed at age 50 or older carried one of the founder mutations. There was no association between mutation status and age at diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Three of 23 medullary breast cancers were inherited (p = 0.038). Carrier status was also associated with a non-significant trend toward advanced tumor stage at diagnosis. These mutations could be evaluated among all ovarian cancer patients and breast cancer patients younger than age 60 and of Hungarian ancestry.
10963624	Molecular epidemiology of genetic polymorphisms in estrogen metabolizing enzymes in human breast cancer.	Epidemiologic studies indicate that most risk factors for breast cancer are related to reproductive and hormonal factors. For a number of years, the mechanism for estrogens in carcinogenesis was thought to be that of mitotic stimulation, with the growth promotion of ductal epithelial cells harboring precursor mutations in the breast. However, evidence is now available that estrogens may act as initiators of cellular alterations and tumorigenesis. Investigation and measurement of serum levels of estrogens in epidemiologic studies may, therefore, be misleading, because they may reflect levels quite different from those of hormone metabolites to which the target tissue is exposed. Proportions of hormone metabolites may be estimated by evaluation of associations between breast cancer risk and genetic polymorphisms in enzymes involved in hormone metabolism. A number of molecular epidemiologic studies have been conducted to evaluate associations between polymorphic genes involved in steroid hormone metabolism (i.e., CYP17, COMT, CYP1A1, CYP19, GST, and MnSOD) that may account for a proportion of enzymatic variability, and results are discussed in this review. There are strengths and limitations to such an approach, foremost of which may be the lack of insight into the extent to which individual variability in estrogen exposure may be explained by allelic variation. Variability in other endogenous and exogenous factors that impact parent hormones and their metabolites along activation and conjugation pathways may also affect associations in case-control comparisons. This and other possible reasons for inconsistencies in results of molecular epidemiologic studies are discussed. Contributions from population-based studies and those from the laboratory may together move this field ahead and more clearly elucidate the basis of hormonally related cancers, identifying etiologic factors and susceptible populations for preventive strategies.
11056682	Glutathione S-transferase M1 null genotype: lack of association with tumour characteristics and survival in advanced breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: Glutathione S-transferase (GST)M1, a member of the mu class GST gene family, has been shown to be polymorphic because of a partial gene deletion. This results in a failure to express the GSTM1 gene in 50-60% of individuals. Several studies have demonstrated a possible link with the GSTM1-null genotype and susceptibility to cancer. Furthermore, a GSTM1 isoenzyme has been positively associated with protective effect against mutagenic drugs, such as alkylating agents and anthracyclines. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether GSTM1 polymorphisms are associated with tumour characteristics and survival in advanced breast cancer patients, and whether it may constitute a prognostic factor. METHODS: We genotyped 92 patients receiving primary chemotherapy, which included cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine and 5-fluorouracil. The relationships between allelism at GSTM1 and clinicopathological parameters including age, menopausal status, tumour size, grade hormone receptors, involved nodes and p53 gene mutations were analysed. Of the patients with GSTM1-positive genotype, tissue samples obtained before and after treatment were available from 28 cases, allowing RNA extraction and GSTM1 expression by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Relationships with clinical response to chemotherapy, and disease-free and overall survival were also evaluated. The data obtained was analysed using logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Of 92 patients, 57.6% (n = 53) were classified as heritably GSTM1-deficient, and 42.4% (n = 39) were of the GSTM1-positive genotype. There were no statistically significant relationships between GSTM1-null genotype and the clinicopathological parameters analysed. No relationship was observed between GSTM1 RNA expression and objective clinical response to chemotherapy. Objective clinical response to chemotherapy was related only to clinical tumour size (P = 0.0177) and to the absence of intraductal carcinoma (P = 0.0013). GSTM1-null genotype had no effect on disease-free or overall survival. The absence of hormone receptors (P = 0.002), the presence of a mutated p53 gene (P = 0.0098) and lack of response to primary chemotherapy (P = 0.0086) were the only factors associated with reduced disease-free or overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: GSTM1-null genotype alone had no effect on tumour characteristics and outcome of patients with advanced breast cancers. The lack of correlation of GSTM1 genotype with clinical tumour features, clinical response to chemotherapy and survival exclude a role for GSTM1 polymorphism as a prognostic factor in advanced breast cancer.
11675150	CYP1A1, CYP2E1 and GSTM1 genetic polymorphisms. The effect of single and combined genotypes on lung cancer susceptibility in Chilean people.	CYP1A1, CYP2E1 and GSTM1 polymorphisms were evaluated in Chilean healthy controls and lung cancer patients. In the Chilean healthy group, frequencies of CYP1A1 variant alleles for MspI (m2 or CYP1A1*2A) and ile/val (val or CYP1A1*2B) polymorphisms were 0.25 and 0.33, respectively. Frequencies of variant alleles C (CYP2E1*6) and c2 (CYP2E1*5B) for CYP2E1 were 0.21 and 0.16, respectively and frequency for GSTM1(-) was 0.24. The presence of variant alleles for GSTM1, MspI and Ile/val polymorphisms was more frequent in cases than in controls. However, frequencies for the c2 and C alleles were not significantly different in controls and in cases. The estimated relative risk for lung cancer associated to a single mutated allele in CYP1A1, CYP2E1 or GSTM1 was 2.41 for m2, 1.69 for val, 1.16 for C, 0.71 for c2 and 2.46 for GSTM1(-). The estimated relative risk was higher for individuals carrying combined CYP1A1 and GSTM1 mutated alleles (m2/val, OR=6.28; m2/GSTM1(-), OR=3.56) and lower in individuals carrying CYP1A1 and CYP2E1 mutated alleles (m2/C, OR=1.39; m2/c2, OR=2.00; val/C, OR=1.45; val/c2, OR=0.48; not significant). The OR values considering smoking were 4.37 for m2, 4.05 for val, 3.47 for GSTM1(-), 7.38 for m2/val and 3.68 for m2/GSTM1(-), higher values than those observed without any stratification by smoking. Taken together, these findings suggest that Chilean people carrying single or combined GSTM1 and CYP1A1 polymorphisms could be more susceptible to lung cancer induced by environmental pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
11737895	Investigation of glutathione S-transferase zeta and the development of sporadic breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: Certain genes from the glutathione S-transferase superfamily have been associated with several cancer types. It was the objective of this study to determine whether alleles of the glutathione S-transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1) gene are associated with the development of sporadic breast cancer. METHODS: DNA samples obtained from a Caucasian population affected by breast cancer and a control population, matched for age and ethnicity, were genotyped for a polymorphism of the GSTZ1 gene. After PCR, alleles were identified by restriction enzyme digestion and results analysed by chi-square and CLUMP analysis. RESULTS: Chi-squared analysis gave a chi2 value of 4.77 (three degrees of freedom) with P = 0.19, and CLUMP analysis gave a T1 value of 9.02 with P = 0.45 for genotype frequencies and a T1 value of 4.77 with P = 0.19 for allele frequencies. CONCLUSION: Statistical analysis indicates that there is no association of the GSTZ1 variant and hence the gene does not appear to play a significant role in the development of sporadic breast cancer.
11810042	Significance of genetic variation at the glutathione S-transferase M1 and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 detoxification genes in breast cancer development.	This work examined the role of constitutional genetic variation at the glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) detoxification loci in breast cancer development. Methods included contrasting patterns of genetic variations at these loci between cases with breast cancer and healthy controls and assessing the association of genotypes with tumor characteristics. Participants were Caucasian women living in the Greater Philadelphia region, recruited from 1988 to 1994, with recently diagnosed women attending breast cancer clinics at Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC) and network affiliated hospitals as cases, and FCCC employees or women attending noncancer clinics as controls. The GSTM1 locus was determined for 402 cases and 238 controls, NQO1 for 346 cases and 235 controls. Results show that neither locus was associated with breast cancer occurrence, with the GSTM1 null genotype occurring at frequencies of 0.560 and 0.563 in cases and controls, respectively [odds ratio (OR) 0.98, 0.95 confidence interval (CI) 0.70-1.38] and the NQO1 wild-type allele at frequencies of 0.808 and 0.845, respectively (OR 0.77, 0.95 CI 0.55-1.06). The GSTM1 null genotype, however, was significantly overrepresented among larger (T3 and T4) primary tumors (OR 7.61, 0.95 CI 1.05-333) and with the occurrence of axillary lymph node metastases (OR 1.62, 0.95 CI 0.98-2.69). NQO1 results revealed that homozygotes for the wild type allele were more likely to have ductal carcinoma and poor histologic grade when compared with individuals carrying one or two mutated alleles (OR 3.50, 0.95 CI 1.41-9.0, and OR 2.26, 0.95 CI 1.18-4.35 for histology type and grade, respectively). We conclude that while these loci are not associated with breast cancer occurrence, the GSTM1 locus is likely associated with tumor progression. NQO1 results suggest that different quinones (possibly estrogenic quinone metabolites) might affect the histological development of breast tumors.
11872636	Aromatic DNA adducts and polymorphisms of CYP1A1, NAT2, and GSTM1 in breast cancer.	Previous studies by us and others have shown a significantly higher level of aromatic DNA adducts in normal adjacent breast tissue samples obtained from breast cancer patients than in those obtained from non-cancerous controls. The increased amount of DNA damage could be related to excess environmental carcinogen exposure and/or genetic susceptibility to such exposure. In the current study, we investigated the relationship between the levels of aromatic DNA adducts in breast tissues and polymorphisms of the drug-metabolizing genes cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1), N-acetyltransferase-2 (NAT2), and glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1), in 166 women having breast cancer. DNA adducts were measured using (32)P-postlabeling and information on smoking status was obtained from medical records. When pooled data of smokers and non-smokers were analyzed by multiple regression analyses, no significant correlation was found between the level of total DNA adducts and age, race, or polymorphisms of CYP1A1, GSTM1, and NAT2. The only significant predictor of the level of DNA adducts in breast tissues was smoking (P = 0.008). When data were analyzed separately in smokers and non-smokers, however, a significant gene-environment interaction was observed. Smokers with CYP1A1*1/*2 or *2/*2 genotypes had a significantly higher level of DNA adducts than those with the CYP1A1*1/*1 genotype. This effect was not seen among non-smokers. There was also a gene-gene interaction, as smokers with combined CYP1A1*1/*2 or CYP1A1*2/*2 genotypes and GSTM1 null had a much higher level of adducts than those with either CYP1A1 or GSTM1 polymorphism. Genetic polymorphisms of CYP1A1 and NAT2 were also significantly correlated with the frequency of certain types of DNA adducts. For example, a bulky benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P)-like adduct was detected in 26% of the samples, the presence of which was not related to age, race, smoking status, or GSTM1 and NAT2 genotype. However, a significantly higher frequency of the B[a[P-like adduct was found in individuals having CYP1A1*1/*2 or *2/*2 genotypes than in those having the *1/*1 genotype (P = 0.04). In addition, individuals having slow NAT2 alleles had a significantly higher frequency of the typical smoking-related DNA adduct pattern, i.e. a diagonal radioactive zone (DRZ), than others did (P = 0.008). These findings suggest that polymorphisms of CYP1A1, GSTM1, and NAT2 significantly affect either the frequency or the level of DNA adducts in normal breast tissues of women having breast cancer, especially in smokers. Further large-scale studies are required to determine the exact role of these polymorphisms and types of DNA damage in breast cancer susceptibility.
12727801	Evaluation of 4-aminobiphenyl-DNA adducts in human breast cancer: the influence of tobacco smoke.	Breast cancer is one of the major cancers around the world but its etiology is still not well understood. Only approximately 50% of the disease is associated with known risk factors including highly penetrant genes and lifestyle factors. Thus, environmental carcinogens may play an important role in the etiology of breast cancer. The arylamine 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) is a tobacco smoke constituent, an environmental contaminant, and a well-established bladder carcinogen in rodents and humans. In this study, we investigated the role of 4-ABP in the etiology of human breast cancer by measuring 4-ABP-DNA adducts using a monoclonal antibody based immunoperoxidase method that had been validated by comparison with gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy analysis of liver tissues from 4-ABP-treated mice. Adducts were analyzed in 150 paraffin-embedded breast tumors and in 55 adjacent normal tissues collected from cases in the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project. The role of polymorphisms in genes involved in the metabolism of 4-ABP including N-acetyl transferase 2 (NAT2), cytochrome P4501A2 (CYP1A2) and glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) and the nucleotide excision repair gene XPD was also explored in the same patients. The mean log-transformed relative staining intensity for 4-ABP-DNA adducts was higher in normal (5.93 +/- 0.54) than in the corresponding tumor (5.44 +/- 0.62, P < 0.0001) tissues. However, a highly significant positive correlation was observed between the levels of 4-ABP-DNA in both tissues (r = 0.72, P < 0.0001). Smoking status was correlated with the levels of 4-ABP-DNA in tumor adjacent normal tissues with a significant linear trend (P = 0.04) for current, former and never smokers; adducts were not related to smoking status in tumor tissues. No correlation was observed between the levels of 4-ABP-DNA and polymorphisms in the genes analyzed even when subjects were stratified by smoking status. These results demonstrate that smoking is associated with increased levels of 4-ABP-DNA adducts in human mammary tissue. In this study, genetic polymorphisms did not significantly affect the formation of 4-ABP-DNA adducts in breast cancer cases, perhaps due to the small number of samples.
7511779	Coordinate induction of glutathione S-transferase alpha, mu, and pi expression in murine liver after a single administration of oltipraz.	The antischistosomal agent oltipraz displays a unique ability to inhibit chemically induced carcinogenesis in a variety of animal models. Its apparent lack of carcinogen specificity and low toxicity make it an attractive candidate for further development as a chemopreventive agent. The mechanism by which oltipraz affords cellular protection is thought to involve the modulation of phase II detoxication enzymes. The present study examines the regulation of each class of glutathione S-transferase (EC 2.5.1.18) in mice after a single oral administration of oltipraz. Glutathione S-transferase activity in the liver increased in a dose-dependent manner after drug exposure. Oltipraz administration (1 g/kg, by gavage) elevated glutathione S-transferase activity to a maximum (4.5-fold) on day 4 after treatment. Western blot analyses demonstrated the induction of all three classes of glutathione S-transferase (alpha, mu, and pi) by oltipraz. Our murine studies suggest that the chemopreventive activity of oltipraz may be due in part to its ability to elevate glutathione S-transferase-mu activity. Consistent with this possibility, associations between the glutathione S-transferase-mu-null phenotype and increased risk for lung, larynx, and bladder cancer have been recently demonstrated in humans. Coordinate elevations in enzymatic activity were preceded by significant elevations in glutathione S-transferase alpha, mu, and pi RNA on day 2 after treatment. Although nuclear run-on assays confirmed the transcriptional induction of all three classes, the maintenance of elevations in enzymatic activity after RNA levels returned to base-line suggests that additional mechanisms are required to regulate glutathione S-transferase expression. Preclinical findings are presented that characterize the response of each class of glutathione S-transferase to oltipraz exposure and support the use of these enzymes as intermediate markers of the chemopreventive activity of oltipraz.
7720046	The etiopathogenesis of breast cancer prevention.	Breast cancer, the most frequent malignancy diagnosed in women, continues to increase in incidence in all industrialized nations. The fact that this disease becomes incurable once it has spread to regional or distant sites indicates that its complexity is beyond our present level of knowledge. A better understanding of the etiopathogenesis and biology of breast cancer is required in order to develop a rational basis for its prevention and therapy. The observation that early parity reduces the risk of developing breast cancer indicates that reproductive and hormonal conditions might play an important role in its prevention. The elucidation of the mechanisms mediating this protection requires the availability of adequate experimental models. The induction of rat mammary carcinomas with chemical carcinogens has proven to be useful for these purposes, especially since, in this model, full-term pregnancy or treatment of virgin rats with a placental hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), prior to the administration of the carcinogen protects the mammary gland from tumor development. Since both pregnancy and hCG treatment induce differentiation of the mammary gland, this process is considered to be essential for the inhibition of the neoplastic process. The possibility of preventing breast cancer by treating young nulliparous females with hormones that mimic a full term pregnancy is of practical interest to the human female population, but it requires a thorough knowledge of the development of the human breast. Our studies indicate that the breast of postpubertal nulliparous women is composed of lobular structures reflecting different stages of development. Type I lobules are the most undifferentiated. Type 2 lobules evolve from the previous ones; they are composed of a higher number of ductular structures per lobule. They progress to lobules types 3 and 4, which are present in the breast during pregnancy and lactation. The type 1 lobule, considered to be the site of origin of ductal carcinomas, predominates in the breast of nulliparous women of all ages. In parous women, the type 3 lobule is the most frequent. Primary cultures derived from breast tissues composed of type 1 lobules express phenotypes of cell transformation not observed in cells derived from type 3 lobules. These data acquire relevance in the light that women with a history of early pregnancy are at a lower risk of developing breast cancer than nulliparous women, an effect attributed to differences in the degree of differentiation of the breast. Pregnancy furthers the differentiation of type 1 lobules to type 3, making them refractory to neoplastic transformation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
7720493	[Clinical studies on serum glutathione S-transferase level in human breast cancer patients].	The level of serum Glutathioe S-transferase (GSTs) was first measured in 224 female patients with breast cancer and 17 patients with benign breast tumor and 96 normal female subjects. The relationship between serum GSTs and biological characteristics of breast cancer was studied. The mean serum GSTs in patients with breast cancer was 1.22 +/- 1.44 ng/ml. The positive rate was 51.8%. The level of serum GSTs in the patients with breast cancer was significantly higher than in normal subjects and patients with benign breast tumor. No correlation was found with regard to the level of serum GSTs, the size of the breast cancer, stage, lymphatic metastasis and estrogen receptor status. Serum GSTs level is thus of little value in the evaluation of response and prognosis of breast cancer.
8068041	Combined depletion of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase and glutathione to modulate nitrosourea resistance in breast cancer.	MCF-7 human breast cancer cells possess high levels of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase and moderate levels of glutathione, and are more resistant to chloroethylnitrosoureas (CNUs) than cells with low levels of either molecule. The role of each as a component of CNU resistance was assessed using O6-benzylguanine (O6-bG) or O6-methylguanine (O6-mG) to deplete the alkyltransferase and L-buthionine sulfoxamine (L-BSO) to deplete glutathione. O6-bG and O6-mG potentiated 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) cytotoxicity, resulting in a dose modification factor of 5.4 and 2.3, respectively, which reflected the more potent inhibitory effect of O6-bG. L-BSO alone had little effect on the survival of MCF-7 cells following BCNU exposure, but when combined with O6-mG, BCNU cytotoxicity was additive, yielding a dose modification factor of 3.2. O6-bG or O6-mG and L-BSO acted independently, as neither class of inhibitor affected the other's mechanism of CNU resistance. Furthermore, MCF-7 cells overexpressing GST mu were not more resistant to BCNU than the parent cell line in either the presence or absence of O6-bG or L-BSO. These results indicate that on a relative basis in MCF-7 cells, the alkyltransferase is the cell's first line of defense against CNUs. This suggests that therapeutic trials based on O6-bG-induced biochemical modulation of CNU resistance may increase the efficacy of these chemotherapeutic agents against human malignant cells and that L-BSO may have little additive effect when used with these agents.
9511178	Polymorphism of the Pi class glutathione S-transferase in normal populations and cancer patients.	Deficiencies of the glutathione transferase isoenzymes GSTM1-1 and GSTT1-1 have been shown to be risk modifiers in a number of different cancers but there have been no similar studies with GSTP1-1, the only member of the Pi class of glutathione S-transferases expressed in humans. Over-expression of GSTP1-1 in tumours suggests that it may be a significant factor in acquired resistance to certain anticancer drugs. We previously identified a cDNA clone with two amino acid substitutions (I105V, A114V). This clone suggests that the GSTP1 gene is polymorphic and it is possible that the different genotypes may be associated with altered cancer risk or drug resistance. In the present study, we report methods for genotyping individuals at codons 105 and 114 of GSTP1 and demonstrate that these two loci are polymorphic in several different racial groups. We also detected significant linkage disequilibrium between these two loci. To determine if either of the alleles at these two loci were associated with altered cancer susceptibility, we genotyped individuals with colorectal cancer or lung cancer. A total of 131 colorectal and 184 lung cancer patients were compared with 199 control individuals. Overall, there were no significant associations between the GSTP1 polymorphisms and either form of cancer.
10199592	Glutathione S-transferases in wild-type and doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines.	1. Overexpression of glutathione S-transferases (GST) in breast cancer cells is hypothesized to be a component of the multifactorial doxorubicin-resistant phenotype. 2. We have characterized the expression of GST enzymes at the catalytic activity, protein and mRNA levels in wild-type MCF-7 (MCF-7/WT) human breast cancer cells and a line selected for resistance to doxorubicin (MCF-7/ADR), with the goal of modulating GST activity to overcome resistance. 3. The MCF-7/ADR cells were 30-65-fold more resistant to doxorubicin than the MCF-7/WT cells. 4. Total cytosolic GST catalytic activity was elevated 23-fold in the MCF-7/ADR cells as compared with the MCF-7/WT cells, and the MCF-7/ADR cells also showed 3-fold increases in catalytic activity toward GST mu and alpha class-selective substrates. Neither cell line showed detectable catalytic activity with a GST mu class-selective substrate. 5. MCF-7/ADR cells showed pronounced overexpression of GST mu protein and GST P1 mRNA in comparison with the wild-type cell line. Neither cell line displayed detectable GST alpha or mu at the protein level. 6. A glutathione analogue that functions as a selective GST alpha inhibitor was more potent at inhibiting total cytosolic GST catalytic activity in the MCF-7/ADR cell line than GST alpha and mu class-selective inhibitory glutathione analogues and the non-selective GST inhibitor ethacrynic acid. 7. The multidrug resistance-associated protein, which can function as a glutathione-conjugate transporter, appeared weakly overexpressed in the MCF-7/ADR cells in comparison with the MCF-7/WT cells.
11045791	The association between glutathione S-transferase M1 genotype and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-DNA adducts in breast tissue.	A major goal in molecular epidemiology is to identify preventable environmental risk factors and susceptible subpopulations. In a hospital-based molecular epidemiological case-control study of breast cancer, we investigated the relationship between DNA damage from exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and susceptibility attributable to inherited deletion of the xenobiotic detoxifying gene, glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1). Prior to breast surgery, women (n = 227) were enrolled and interviewed and donated a blood sample. PAH-DNA adduct levels were measured by immunohistochemistry in breast tissue samples retrieved from pathology blocks, and GSTM1 genotype was determined by PCR using WBC DNA. The GSTM1 analysis included 95 cases and 87 benign breast disease controls. GSTM1 genotype was not associated with breast cancer case-control status (odds ratio = 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-1.44). However, the GSTM1 null genotype predicted PAH-DNA adduct levels in malignant (beta = 0.407; P = 0.003) and nonmalignant (beta = 0.243; P = 0.05) breast tissue from cases. This relationship was not seen in tissue from controls (beta = 0.095; P = 0.341). When tissue from controls was compared with tumor tissue from cases, there was a significant case-control difference in PAH-DNA adduct levels among women who were GSTM1 null. There was no such case-control difference among women who were homozygous or heterozygous for GSTM1. There was an interaction between GSTM1 and case-control status on adduct levels in breast tissue (P = 0.002). The results suggest that genetic susceptibility to the formation of PAH-DNA adducts in breast tissue may play a role in breast cancer development.
11169956	Genetic polymorphism at the glutathione S-transferase (GST) P1 locus is a breast cancer risk modifier.	The isolation of full-length cDNAs of naturally occurring GSTP1 gene variants, and the demonstration that these alleles are distributed in the normal population, have provided conclusive evidence that the human GSTP1 gene locus is polymorphic and that specific GSTP1 alleles may be associated with different risk for cancers or other diseases. Recent data have indicated that the different GSTP1 alleles encode proteins with different enzymatic activities against carcinogens. In this case-control study, we examined the effect of the GSTP1 genetic polymorphism and its interaction with other factors to determine breast cancer risk. GSTP1 and GSTM1 genotypes of 220 breast cancer patients and 196 controls, all residents of western France, were examined. Data on menopausal status and family cancer history were obtained from 195 patients and 147 controls. Exons 5 and 6 of the GSTP1 gene, which contain the polymorphic nucleotide transitions, were analyzed by DNA polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism to distinguish between the GSTP1 alleles. In the control population, GSTP1 allelic frequencies were 64.3%, 26.0% and 9.7%, respectively, for GSTP1*A, GSTP1*B and GSTP1*C. In the breast cancer patients, the frequencies were 67.9% for GSTP1*A, 26.8% for GSTP1*B and 5.3% for GSTP1*C. In multivariate analysis, breast cancer risk increased by 7.7-fold (p < 0.001) in women with a family history of cancers and 2.18-fold (p = 0.026) in non-GSTP1*C individuals. GSTM1 genotypes did not emerge as risk factor. Our results show that in addition to well-known risk factors, in particular, a family history of cancer, GSTP1 allelopolymorphism is a significant modifier of breast cancer risk. The results also suggest a protective role against breast cancer for the GSTP1*C allele.
11179017	Prevalence and penetrance of germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in a population series of 649 women with ovarian cancer.	A population-based series of 649 unselected incident cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed in Ontario, Canada, during 1995-96 was screened for germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. We specifically tested for 11 of the most commonly reported mutations in the two genes. Then, cases were assessed with the protein-truncation test (PTT) for exon 11 of BRCA1, with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis for the remainder of BRCA1, and with PTT for exons 10 and 11 of BRCA2. No mutations were found in all 134 women with tumors of borderline histology. Among the 515 women with invasive cancers, we identified 60 mutations, 39 in BRCA1 and 21 in BRCA2. The total mutation frequency among women with invasive cancers, 11.7% (95% confidence interval [95%CI] 9.2%-14.8%), is higher than previous estimates. Hereditary ovarian cancers diagnosed at age <50 years were mostly (83%) due to BRCA1, whereas the majority (60%) of those diagnosed at age >60 years were due to BRCA2. Mutations were found in 19% of women reporting first-degree relatives with breast or ovarian cancer and in 6.5% of women with no affected first-degree relatives. Risks of ovarian, breast, and stomach cancers and leukemias/lymphomas were increased nine-, five-, six- and threefold, respectively, among first-degree relatives of cases carrying BRCA1 mutations, compared with relatives of noncarriers, and risk of colorectal cancer was increased threefold for relatives of cases carrying BRCA2 mutations. For carriers of BRCA1 mutations, the estimated penetrance by age 80 years was 36% for ovarian cancer and 68% for breast cancer. In breast-cancer risk for first-degree relatives, there was a strong trend according to mutation location along the coding sequence of BRCA1, with little evidence of increased risk for mutations in the 5' fifth, but 8.8-fold increased risk for mutations in the 3' fifth (95%CI 3.6-22.0), corresponding to a carrier penetrance of essentially 100%. Ovarian, colorectal, stomach, pancreatic, and prostate cancer occurred among first-degree relatives of carriers of BRCA2 mutations only when mutations were in the ovarian cancer-cluster region (OCCR) of exon 11, whereas an excess of breast cancer was seen when mutations were outside the OCCR. For cancers of all sites combined, the estimated penetrance of BRCA2 mutations was greater for males than for females, 53% versus 38%. Past studies may have underestimated the contribution of BRCA2 to ovarian cancer, because mutations in this gene cause predominantly late-onset cancer, and previous work has focused more on early-onset disease. If confirmed in future studies, the trend in breast-cancer penetrance, according to mutation location along the BRCA1 coding sequence, may have significant impact on treatment decisions for carriers of BRCA1-mutations. As well, BRCA2 mutations may prove to be a greater cause of cancer in male carriers than previously has been thought.
11934439	Association of DNA-protein crosslinks and breast cancer.	This study examined the possible effect of cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1), glutathione S-transferase (GSTM1 and T1) and N-acetyltransferases 2 (NAT2) polymorphisms on DNA-protein crosslinks (DPC) formation in the white blood cells of breast cancer patients, and assessed the levels of DPC detected. Sixty cases of breast cancer were examined, all involving women diagnosed with primary, histopathologically confirmed breast cancer at the Chinese Medical College Hospital in central Taiwan. Additionally, 60 healthy women without breast cancer were selected as a control group, matched by age, cigarette smoking habits, and history of breast cancer among first-degree relatives. Known risk factors for breast cancer, including menarche before 13 years of age (OR=3.2; CI, 1.1-9.5), no history of breast-feeding (OR=4.7; CI, 1.5-14.4) and use of oral contraceptives (OR=9.1; CI, 2.8-29.8), were found to be significantly associated with breast cancer. For the CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism, 16.7 and 18.3% of cases and controls, respectively contained both alleles with the MspI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Regarding the NAT2 allele, 25.0 and 21.7% of cases and controls carried slow genotypes. For GSTM1 and GSTT1, 56.7 and 45.0% of cases, as well as 58.3 and 43.3% of controls, contained the null genotype. Meanwhile, chi(2)-tests found no significant differences between the groups. After controlling for confounders such as cigarette smoking and family history of breast cancer, the DPC value of the case group significantly exceeded that of the control group (1.62% versus 0.98%, P<0.001). In conclusion, our findings were inconsistent with those of previous studies that showed polymorphism genes (CYP1A1, NAT2, GSTM1 and GSTT1) were associated with cancer risk. However, this study indicated that genotypic variants of these polymorphisms did not elevate the risk for breast cancer, individually or interactively. Additionally, this investigation represents the first description of the use of DPC as a biomarker to assess the level of DNA damage of breast cancer patients. Our data suggest that the DPC method is a useful tool for detecting DNA damage, and DPC formation may be associated with the induction of breast cancer.
12175533	CYP1A1, GSTM1, and GSTT1 polymorphisms and breast cancer risk in Brazilian women.	The frequency of CYP1A1 (CYP1A1*2A), GSTM1, and GSTT1 polymorphisms, as well as the main risk factors associated with breast cancer were studied in Brazilian women, with malignant breast cancer (n=128), or age-matched controls (n=256). Only a family history of breast cancer presented a significant risk (OR=3.00, CI=1.27-7.06). Among non-whites, the CYP1A1*2A allele was underrepresented among patients. Statistical analysis indicated that this polymorphism may decrease the risk of breast cancer among these individuals, particularly after adjusting for the risk presented by selected risk factors (OR=0.30, 95% CI=0.12-0.76).
12183419	A population-based study of the Arg399Gln polymorphism in X-ray repair cross- complementing group 1 (XRCC1) and risk of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.	XRCC1 (X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1) is a base excision repair protein that plays a central role in the repair of DNA strand breaks and base damage from a variety of endogenous and exogenous oxidants including tobacco smoke. One genetic polymorphism (G-->A, Arg-->Gln at codon 399) occurs within a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase binding region and within the central breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 product COOH terminus domain of XRCC1. The variant 399Gln allele of XRCC1 has been associated with elevated biomarkers of DNA damage in human cells. We conducted an analysis of the Arg399Gln polymorphism in XRCC1 using genomic DNA, and questionnaire information from 309 cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 964 controls that were part of a population-based, case-control study conducted in the San Francisco Bay Area between 1994 and 2001. We genotyped individuals using a mass spectrometry-based method. Because smoking and obesity are known and suspected pancreas cancer risk factors, and have been associated with DNA damage and oxidative stress in target tissues, we estimated odds ratios (ORs), interaction contrast ratios (ICRs), and 95% confidence intervals for the combined effects of XRCC1 genotype and smoking or body mass index (in kg/m(2)). We also assessed potential gene-gene interactions between polymorphisms in XRCC1 and CYP1A1, GSTT1, and GSTM1. We found little or no evidence for an association between XRCC1 genotype and pancreatic cancer among Caucasians, African-Americans, or Asians. There was evidence for interaction between XRCC1 399Gln and smoking that was stronger among women than men. Relative to never active or passive smokers with the Arg/Arg genotype, the age- and race-adjusted ORs and ICRs (95% confidence limits) for heavy smoking (>or=41 pack-years) were: for Gln/Gln or Arg/Gln genotypes [women OR = 7.0 (2.4, 21), ICR = 3.1 (0.03, 6.2); men OR = 2.4 (1.1, 5.0), ICR = 1.3 (-0.20, 2.8)]; and for the Arg/Arg genotype [women OR = 2.2 (0.73, 6.4); men OR = 1.5 (0.68, 3.2)]. Analyses of combined genotypes suggested an interaction between XRCC1 (Gln/Gln or Arg/Gln) and GSTT1/GSTM1-null/null among women but not among men. There was no evidence of interaction between XRCC1 genotype and body mass index. Our results suggest that the XRCC1 399Gln allele is a potentially important determinant of susceptibility to smoking-induced pancreatic cancer. Our findings, including stronger associations and interactions among women, require replication in additional study populations.
12860276	N-acetyltransferase (NAT1, NAT2) and glutathione S-transferase (GSTM1, GSTT1) polymorphisms in breast cancer.	To evaluate the potential association between NAT1/NAT2 polymorphisms and breast cancer, a case-control study was conducted in Korean women (254 cases, 301 controls). NAT1 *4/*10 genotype (42%) was the most common NAT1 genotype in this Korean population. The frequencies of slow, intermediate and rapid NAT2 acetylator genotype were 16, 39 and 44% in cases and 16, 42 and 42% in controls. Neither NAT1 rapid (homozygous or heterozygous NAT1 *10) (OR=1.2, 95% CI=0.8-1.9) nor NAT2 rapid acetylator genotype (OR=1.2, 95% CI=0.8-1.7) showed significant association with breast cancer risk. Although the risk of NAT2 rapid acetylator genotype in postmenopausal women (OR=1.4, 95% CI=0.7-2.8) was higher than that in premenopausal women (OR=1.1, 95% CI=0.7-1.7), those were not statistically significant. However, combinations of NAT1, GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes showed a significant linear gene-dosage relationship with breast cancer (p for trend=0.04) and those women with NAT2 rapid acetylator and both GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes were at the elevated risk (OR=3.1, 95% CI=1.0-9.1). These results suggest that genetic polymorphisms of NAT1 and NAT2 have no independent effect on breast cancer risk, but they modulate breast cancer risk in the presence of GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes.
7773252	Glutathione S-transferases in housefly (Musca domestica): location of GST-1 and GST-2 families.	The two families of dipteran glutathione S-transferases (GST-1 and GST-2) were located separately by immunohistology on sections of adult houseflies. GST-1 was distributed in haemolymph cells, whereas GST-2 was found in the indirect flight muscles of the thorax and in the central nervous system. In the muscles, the distribution of GST-2 seemed to be uniform in cells, whereas in the brain and the thoracic ganglia GST-2 was found mainly in the cortical areas which are made up by cell bodies. Comparison of the GSTs' location between an insecticide susceptible strain of housefly and resistant ones indicated no variation due to resistance. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests were used to dose GST-2. In houseflies, there were 60 pmol of GST-2/fly, 80-90% being found in the thorax, about 10% in the head and the remainder in the abdomen. Furthermore, the roles of these GSTs are discussed in relation to their location and our knowledge on their catalytic activities or their transport ability in invertebrates and mammals.
7836799	Expression of GST-mu transferase in breast cancer patients and healthy controls.	The expression of glutathione S-transferase mu was measured by a qualitative immunoenzymatic assay in the blood samples of 108 women (63 breast cancer patients and 45 healthy controls) in order to analyze the relationships of GST-mu phenotype and smoking habits with tumor characteristics of breast cancer patients, such as tumor extension, nodal status, hormone receptor status and DNA content by flow cytometry. GST-mu was expressed in 53/108 (49%) of cases without any significant difference between healthy or neoplastic subjects, smokers or non-smokers, pre or post-menopausal, younger or older subjects. Moreover, the percentages of the GST-mu phenotype did not differ significantly in patients with different ER and PgR tumor status, tumor extension or nodal status. By contrast, aneuploid DNA tumor content was shown to be significantly associated with GST-mu expression (24% and 76% GST-mu positive, respectively, in diploid and aneuploid cases; p < 0.003). The biological meaning of this association remains to be interpreted.
10454258	Ethnic susceptibility to lung cancer: differences in CYP2E1, CYP1A1 and GSTM1 genetic polymorphisms between French Caucasian and Chilean populations.	Many investigators have reported an association between genetic polymorphisms of cytochromes P-450 CYP2E1, CYP1A1 or glutathione S-transferase Mu (GSTM1) and susceptibility to lung cancer. However, pronounced interethnic variations have been described in the frequencies of these polymorphisms, especially between Asians and Caucasians. The present study was set up to establish CYP2E1 (c1, c2 and C, D), CYP1A1 (m1, m2 and Ile, Val) and GSTM1 (null) allelic frequencies in Chileans (n = 96) who are an admixture of Native Americans and Caucasians (Spaniards). The rare allele frequencies were found to be 0.15 (c2), 0.21 (C), 0.23 (m2), 0.32 (Val) and 0.21 ('null' genotype). These values are significantly higher than those of Caucasians except for the GSTM1 'null' genotype and suggest differences in susceptibility to lung cancer between both populations.
10548311	A systematic review of genetic polymorphisms and breast cancer risk.	Studies investigating the relationship between common genetic variants and cancer risk are being reported with rapidly increasing frequency. We have identified 46 published case-control studies that have examined the effect of common alleles of 18 different genes on breast cancer risk. Of these, 12 report statistically significant associations, none of which were reported by more than one study. However, many of the studies were small: 10 of the 46 had 80% power or greater to detect a rare allele homozygote relative risk <2.5. We therefore combined the results of individual studies to obtain more precise estimates of risk. Statistically significant differences in genotype frequencies were found in three case-control comparisons of unselected cases. These were for CYP19 (TTTA)n polymorphism [(TTTA)10 carrier odds ratio (OR) = 2.33; P = 0.002], the GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism (Val carrier OR = 1.60; P = 0.02), and the TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism (Pro carrier OR = 1.27; P = 0.03). In addition, the GSTM1 gene deletion was found to be significantly associated with postmenopausal breast cancer (null homozygote OR = 1.33; P = 0.04). There was also some evidence that homozygotes for the PR PROGINS allele are protected against breast cancer, although this result was of borderline statistical significance. For polymorphisms in BRCA1, COMT, CYP17, CYP1A1, NAT1, and NAT2, the best estimate of risk either from the individual studies or the meta-analyses was sufficiently precise to exclude a relative risk of 1.5 or greater. For the polymorphisms in EDH17B2, ER, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, GSTT1, HSP70, and TNFalpha, the risk estimates, although nonsignificant, were insufficiently precise to exclude a moderate risk (>1.5). Precise estimation of the risks associated with these and other as yet untested genes, as well as investigation of more complex risks arising from gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, will require much larger studies.
11032590	Breast imaging with positron emission tomography and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose: use and limitations.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic value of positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for the diagnosis of primary breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Preoperatively, 144 patients with masses suggestive of breast cancer underwent PET imaging of the breast. To identify breast cancer by increased metabolic activity, parametric FDG-PET images were analyzed for increased tracer uptake applying conventional image reading (CIR) and sensitive image reading (SIR). One hundred eighty-five breast tumors were evaluated by histology, revealing 132 breast carcinomas and 53 benign masses. RESULTS: Breast carcinomas were identified with an overall sensitivity of 64.4% (CIR) and 80.3% (SIR). The increase in sensitivity (SIR) resulted in a noticeable decrease in specificity, from 94.3% (CIR) to 75.5% (SIR). At stage pT1, only 30 (68.2%) of 44 breast carcinomas were detected, compared with 57 (91.9%) of 62 at stage pT2. A higher percentage of invasive lobular carcinomas were false-negative (65.2%) compared with invasive ductal carcinomas (23.7%). Nevertheless, positive PET scans provided a high positive-predictive value (96.6%) for breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Partial volume effects and varying metabolic activity (dependent on tumor type) seem to represent the most significant limitations for the routine diagnostic application of PET. The number of invasive procedures is therefore unlikely to be significantly reduced by PET imaging in patients presenting with abnormal mammography. However, the high positive-predictive value, resulting from the increased metabolic activity of malignant tissue, may be used with carefully selected subsets of patients as well as to determine the extent of disease or to assess therapy response.
11291049	Genetic susceptibility to breast cancer in French-Canadians: role of carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes and gene-environment interactions.	Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy among women. Since genetic factors such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 as well as reproductive history constitute only 30% of the cause, environmental exposure may play a significant role in the development of breast cancer. Likewise, the relevant enzymes involved in the biotransformation of xenobiotics (from tobacco smoke, diet or other environmental sources) might play a role in breast carcinogenesis. Since individuals with modified ability to metabolize these carcinogens could have a different risk for breast cancer, we investigated the role of cytochromes P-450 (CYP1A1, CYP2D6), glutathione-S-transferases (GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1) and N-acetyltransferases (NAT1, NAT2) gene variants in breast carcinogenesis. A case-control study was conducted on 149 women with breast carcinoma and 207 healthy controls, both of French-Canadian origin. The CYP1A1*4 allele was found to be a significant risk determinant of breast carcinoma (OR = 3.3, 95% CI 1.1-9.7), particularly among post-menopausal women (OR = 4.0, 95% CI 1.2-13.8). The frequency of NAT2 rapid acetylators was increased among smokers (OR = 2.6, 95% CI 0.8-8.2), while the NAT1*10 allele conferred a 4-fold increase in risk among women who consumed well-done meat (OR = 4.4, 95% CI 1.0-18.9). These data suggest that CYP1A1*4, NAT1 and NAT2 variants are involved in the susceptibility to breast carcinoma by modifying the impact of exogenous and/or endogenous exposures.
11295132	[Polymorphisms of the CYP1A1 and GSTM1 genes and their combined effects on individual susceptibility to lung cancer in a Chinese population].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the polymorphisms of CYP1A1 and GSTM1 genes as well as their separate and combined effects on individual susceptibility to lung cancer. METHODS: In the matched 106 pairs of patients with lung cancer and non-cancer control persons, genomic DNA were prepared from peripheral blood samples. The genotypes of CYP1A1 Ile/Val and GSTM1+/0 polymorphisms were detected by the allele-specific(AS)-PCR and multidifferential(MD)-PCR. RESULTS: Individuals with genotype Val/Val of CYP1A1, genotype 0/0 of GSTM1, combined genotypes GSTM1 0/0 and CYP1A1 Val/Val, or combined genotypes GSM1 0/0 and CYP1A1 Ile/Val had higher relative risk than those with the corresponding common genotypes and combined genotypes; their odds ratios were 4.02(P=0.03), 1.92(P=0.019), 9.38(P=0.04) and 3.27(P=0.01), respectively. CONCLUSION: There is a synergy of susceptible genotypes GSTM1 0/0 and CYP1A1 Val/Val or CYP1A1 Ile/Val to enhance the individual susceptibility to lung cancer.
11848510	GSTM1, P53 and K-ras molecular detection in resectable non-small cell lung cancer by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis-bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis.	BACKGROUND: Understanding molecular abnormalities could potentially lead to novel investigational approaches in the molecular epidemiology of lung cancer. These might include the identification of patients at high risk for primary NSCLC and the surveillance of patients with known NSCLC who are being treated using lung-sparing surgical strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) strategy was used for primary tumors and corresponding bronchalveolare lavage (BAL) samples. RESULTS: We recruited 36 consecutive patients with NSCLC, 28 (77.7%) males and 8 females (22.3%). DGGE showed a good rate of accuracy in the genetic screening of K-ras and p53 mutations in BAL specimens. Specific mutations were more often detected in BAL fluid from patients with not peripheral tumors than parenchymal or peripheral tumors (p53: 85.7%, p=0.0004; K-ras: 75%, p=0.001). p53 mutations were more frequent in BAL fluid from squamous cell carcinomas (22%) than from adenocarcinomas (15%). A significant correlation was observed between null GST-Ml genotype and p53 overall mutations (p=0.0003), K-ras mutations (p=0.02), non peripheral tumors (p=0.04) and smoking habits (p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: We observed that null GSTMl genotype is strongly related to p53 mutations. Individuals at high risk for primary NSCLC, such as heavy smokers or individuals exposed to occupational carcinogens, could be screened by BAL-analysis for cancer biomarkers of susceptibility like GSTM-1 in large scale molecular epidemiology studies.
11956092	Brostallicin, a novel anticancer agent whose activity is enhanced upon binding to glutathione.	Brostallicin (PNU-166196) is a synthetic alpha-bromoacrylic, second-generation DNA minor groove binder structurally related to distamycin A, presently in Phase II trials in Europe and the United States. The compound shows broad antitumor activity in preclinical models and dramatically reduced in vitro myelotoxicity in human hematopoietic progenitor cells compared with that of other minor groove binders. Brostallicin showed a 3-fold higher activity in melphalan-resistant L1210 murine leukemia cells than in the parental line (IC(50) = 0.46 and 1.45 ng/ml, respectively) under conditions in which the cytotoxicity of conventional antitumor agents was either unaffected or reduced. This melphalan-resistant cell line has increased levels of glutathione (GSH) in comparison with the parental cells. Conversely, GSH depletion by buthionine sulfoximine in a human ovarian carcinoma cell line (A2780) significantly decreased both the cytotoxic and the proapoptotic effects of brostallicin. In one experiment, human glutathione S-transferase pi (GST-pi) cDNA was transfected into A2780 cells, and four clones of A2780 with different expression levels of GST-pi were generated (i.e., two clones with high and two clones with low GST-pi expression). A 2-3-fold increase in GST-pi levels resulted in a 2-3-fold increase in cytotoxic activity of brostallicin. Similar results were obtained for GST-pi-transfected human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7). Brostallicin showed 5.8-fold increased cytotoxicity in GST-pi-transfected versus empty vector-transfected cells with low GST-pi expression. In an in vivo experiment, A2780 clones were implanted into nude mice. The antitumor activity of brostallicin was higher in the GST-pi-overexpressing tumors without increased toxicity. Regarding the mechanism of action, brostallicin interacts reversibly with the DNA minor groove TA-rich sequences but appears unreactive in classical in vitro DNA alkylation assays. We speculated that an intracellular reactive nucleophilic species, e.g., GSH, could react with the alpha-bromoacrylamide moiety functions. Experiments on the interaction with plasmid DNA showed a change of the DNA topology from supercoiled to circular form (nicking) in the presence of GSH, whereas no change was found in its absence. In vitro incubations of brostallicin were performed with the human recombinant GST isoenzymes A1-1, M1-1, and P1-1 (alpha, mu and pi isoenzymes, respectively) in the presence of GSH. The decrease in brostallicin levels was monitored in these incubations; the rate of loss (and therefore brostallicin metabolism) was significantly higher for the M1-1 and P1-1 isoenzymes than for the A1-1 isoenzyme.
12556960	Glutathione S-transferase M1 and T1 genetic polymorphisms, alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk.	Alcohol consumption has been inconsistently associated with breast cancer risk. Recent studies suggest that genetic polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) may modify this relation. To determine if breast cancer risk is associated with GSTM1 and GSTT1 genetic polymorphisms, and to evaluate the effect modification between GST genotypes and alcohol consumption in the risk of breast cancer, we conducted a case-control study in the state of Connecticut in the period 1998 and 2001. Cases were histologically confirmed, incident breast cancer patients in New Haven County, CT. Controls were randomly selected from women histologically confirmed to be without breast cancer. The study results show that, while GSTM1 genotypes were not associated with breast cancer risk, GSTT1-null genotype was associated with a significant 90% increased risk for postmenopausal women (OR=1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3.0). Analysis by GST genotypes and alcohol consumption shows that GSTM1A ever-drinking women had a 2.5-fold (OR=2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.5) increased risk of breast cancer compared to the GSTM1A never-drinkers, and the risk increases with duration and daily amount of alcohol consumption. Postmenopausal women with GSTT1-null genotype, who consumed a lifetime of >250 kg of spirit-equivalents, had an almost seven-fold increased risk (OR=6.8, 95% CI 1.4-33.9), and drinking commencing at younger ages appears to carry a higher risk. An OR of 8.2 (95% CI 1.2-57.4) was observed for those with GSTM1A, and GSTT1-null genotypes who had consumed a lifetime of >250 kg of spirit-equivalents. In conclusion, alcohol consumption may increase breast cancer risk among those who carry susceptible GST genotypes.
14504370	Glutathione S-transferases M1-1 and T1-1 as risk modifiers for renal cell cancer associated with occupational exposure to chemicals.	AIMS: To investigate the possible interaction between occupational risk factors and genotype for glutathione S-transferases M1 and T1 (GSTM1 and GSTT1) in renal cell cancer (RCC). METHODS: One hundred patients with RCC and 200 outpatient controls were enrolled at Parma University Hospital. The polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferase M1-1 (GSTM1) and T1-1 (GSTT1) were investigated by PCR; occupational history was collected by a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: Subjects with GSTM1 present genotype showed higher risks for RCC, compared to GSTM1 null subjects, if exposed to metals (OR 2.73; 95% CI 0.91 to 8.22 v 1.14; 95% CI 0.46 to 2.82) or pesticides (OR 3.46; 95% CI 1.12 to 10.74 v 1.59; 95% CI 0.48 to 5.34). The GSTT1 present genotype also enhanced the risk (about twofold) of RCC among subjects exposed to solvents and pesticides, compared with those GSTT1 null. CONCLUSIONS: Results support the hypothesis that GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms can interact with several occupational exposures to significantly modify the risk of RCC among exposed subjects.
9062391	Differential expression of annexin I in human mammary ductal epithelial cells in normal and benign and malignant breast tissues.	Annexins are a family of structurally related, water-soluble proteins that have calcium- and phospholipid-binding domains. Annexin I is thought to be involved in cell proliferation and differentiation and has recently been shown to be expressed on the surfaces of lymphoma cells where it acts as an endothelial cell adhesion molecule. To evaluate the expression of annexin I in relation to human breast cancer development and progression we used breast biopsy tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis of annexin I in paraffin-embedded ductal epithelial cells of various human breast tissues indicated that this annexin was not demonstrable in the ductal luminal cells of normal breast tissues (n = 11) and benign tumors (n = 10) (except for one ductal adenoma) but was generally expressed in various types of breast cancers, including noninvasive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), invasive and metastatic breast tumors (n = 33). The results suggest that annexin I expression might correlate with malignant breast cancer progression but it is most likely involved at an early stage of human breast cancer development.
9232338	Glutathione S-transferase class mu deletion polymorphism and breast cancer: results from prevalent versus incident cases.	A common deletion polymorphism in the gene coding for the glutathione S-transferase class mu (the GSTM1 gene) results in a decreased ability to detoxify carcinogenic epoxide intermediates and has been associated with increased breast cancer risk in some small studies. We studied the GSTM1 gene deletion polymorphism (conferring the null genotype) in 243 women who had prevalent breast cancer and 245 women without breast cancer, who were among the 32,826 women in the Nurses' Health Study who gave a blood sample in 1989-1990. In the prevalent case series, the null genotype was slightly more common among cases (58%) than among controls (51%; age-adjusted odds ratio = 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.86). Among cases, the prevalence of the GSTM1 deletion increased with duration of survival [68% for > or = 8 years since diagnosis; 57% for 4-8 years; 51% for < 4 years; P (trend) = 0.04]. In an incident case series of 240 women who were diagnosed with breast cancer following blood collection and prior to June of 1992 and compared with age-matched controls, the GSTM1 deletion was not associated with an elevation in risk (relative risk, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-1.57). No significant interaction with cigarette smoking was evident. Thus, there was no significant increase in risk of incident breast cancer associated with the GSTM1 null genotype; however, the gene deletion polymorphism appeared to confer improved survival. These data suggest that odds ratios based upon prevalent cases in molecular epidemiologic studies may be biased due to differential survival. Further studies are required to determine whether this polymorphism is associated with improved breast cancer prognosis.
9238034	Mouse mammary tumor virus/v-Ha-ras transgene-induced mammary tumors exhibit strain-specific allelic loss on mouse chromosome 4.	Hybrid mice carrying oncogenic transgenes afford powerful systems for investigating loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumors. Here, we apply this approach to a neoplasm of key importance in human medicine: mammary carcinoma. We performed a whole genome search for LOH using the mouse mammary tumor virus/v-Ha-ras mammary carcinoma model in female (FVB/N x Mus musculus castaneus)F1 mice. Mammary tumors developed as expected, as well as a few tumors of a second type (uterine leiomyosarcoma) not previously associated with this transgene. Genotyping of 94 anatomically independent tumors revealed high-frequency LOH ( approximately 38%) for markers on chromosome 4. A marked allelic bias was observed, with M. musculus castaneus alleles almost exclusively being lost. No evidence of genomic imprinting effects was noted. These data point to the presence of a tumor suppressor gene(s) on mouse chromosome 4 involved in mammary carcinogenesis induced by mutant H-ras expression, and for which a significant functional difference may exist between the M. musculus castaneus and FVB/N alleles. Provisional subchromosomal localization of this gene, designated Loh-3, can be made to a distal segment having syntenic correspondence to human chromosome 1p; LOH in this latter region is observed in several human malignancies, including breast cancers. Evidence was also obtained for a possible second locus associated with LOH with less marked allele bias on proximal chromosome 4.
10564681	Glutathione S-transferase mu and theta polymorphisms and breast cancer susceptibility.	BACKGROUND: The enzymes encoded by the glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1) and theta 1 (GSTT1) genes are involved in the metabolism (mainly inactivation, but activation is possible) of a wide range of carcinogens that are ubiquitous in the environment; the enzyme encoded by the GSTT1 gene may also be active in endogenous mutagenic processes. Homozygous deletions of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes are commonly found in the population and result in a lack of enzyme activity. This study was undertaken to evaluate the association between GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphisms and breast cancer risk. METHODS: Our study included 466 women with incident cases of breast cancer occurring from May 1989 through May 1994 and 466 matched control subjects. These individuals were part of a prospective cohort of U.S. women (i.e., the Nurses' Health Study). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between genetic polymorphisms and breast cancer risk. RESULTS: The GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes were not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (OR = 1.05 [95% CI = 0.80-1.37] for GSTM1 null; OR = 0. 86 [95% CI = 0.61-1.21] for GSTT1 null). On the contrary, a suggestion of a decreased risk of breast cancer associated with the GSTT1 null genotype was observed among premenopausal women. When considered together, no combination of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The relationship between GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene deletions and breast cancer risk was not substantially modified by cigarette smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence against a substantially increased risk of breast cancer associated with GSTM1 and/or GSTT1 homozygous gene deletions.
10755383	Progression of human breast cancers to the metastatic state is linked to genotypes of catechol-O-methyltransferase.	There is increasing evidence that catecholestrogens may contribute to the development of breast cancer. Specifically, inactivation of catecholestrogens may prevent the genesis and arrest the progression of the disease. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), Glutathione S-transferase (GST) M1 and GSTP1 are responsible for the detoxification of catecholestrogens, and are polymorphic in the human population. In this study, a PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was performed to determine genotypes of the COMT, GSTM1 and GSTP1 genes. We investigated the relationship between the germline polymorphism of these genes and clinico-pathological characteristics in 140 patients with breast cancer. Among 73 patients with the low activity COMT allele, 49 (67%) had regional lymph node metastasis. On the other hand, only 27 (40%) of 67 patients without the low activity allele had lymph node metastasis. The COMT genotype was significantly associated with clinical stage and the extent of regional lymph node metastasis of breast cancer (P<0.05). However, polymorphisms of the GSTM1 and GSTP1 gene were not associated with clinico-pathological factors. Our findings suggest that the allele encoding for low activity COMT may contribute to the progression of breast cancer.
11303592	Glutathione S-transferase M1, M3, P1, and T1 genetic polymorphisms and susceptibility to breast cancer.	This study was undertaken to examine if glutathione S-transferase (GST) M1, M3, P1, and T1 genotypes affected breast cancer risk in Finnish women. The study population consisted of 483 incident breast cancer cases and 482 healthy population controls. Genotyping analyses were performed by PCR-based methods, and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression adjusting for known or suspected risk factors for breast cancer. When the genes were studied separately, the only significant finding was between GSTM1 null genotype and postmenopausal breast cancer risk (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.03-2.15). Conversely, when the potential combined effects of the at-risk genotypes were examined, significant associations were observed only among premenopausal women. Although only a moderate risk of breast cancer was seen for premenopausal women concurrently carrying the GSTM3*B allele containing genotypes and the GSTP1 Ile/ Ile genotype (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.02-4.18), the risk rose steeply if they simultaneously lacked the GSTT1 gene (OR, 9.93, 95% CI, 1.10-90.0). A borderline significant increase in the risk of breast cancer was also seen for premenopausal women with the combination of GSTM1 null, GSTP1 Ile/Ile, and GSTT1 null genotypes (OR, 3.96; 95% CI, 0.99-15.8). Our findings support the view that GST genotypes contribute to the individual breast cancer risk, especially in certain combinations.
11773866	Combined COMT and GST genotypes and hormone replacement therapy associated breast cancer risk.	Our previous studies suggested that both COMT and GST genotypes might modify individual breast cancer risk. Here, we extended the studies to examine the potential combined effect of these genotypes in susceptibility to breast cancer. Our study population consisted of 483 Finnish breast cancer cases and 482 population control subjects. The odds ratios (ORs) and (95%) confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression adjusting for known or suspected confounding factors. No significant increase in the overall breast cancer risk was seen for any combinations of the studied genotypes. However, a substantially increased risk of breast cancer was seen for women who had used hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and simultaneously carried the COMT-L allele containing genotypes and either the GSTP1 Ile/Ile genotype (OR 4.10, 95% CI 1.24-13.6) or the GSTT1 null genotype (OR 4.19, 95% CI 1.30-13.5). These associations appeared to be mainly attributable to long-term users of HRT; the respective ORs were 7.00 (95% CI 1.21-40.6) and 8.36 (95% CI 1.44-49.0) among the users of HRT of more than 30 months. In addition, the combination of COMT-L allele containing genotypes with the GSTM1 null genotype posed a remarkably increased risk (OR 9.10, 95% CI 1.84-45.0) of breast cancer in this study group. These results suggest that the use of HRT could substantially increase the risk of breast cancer among women with specific combinations of the at-risk genotypes of COMT and GST genes.
11943609	Analyses of bulky DNA adduct levels in human breast tissue and genetic polymorphisms of cytochromes P450 (CYPs), myeloperoxidase (MPO), quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs).	Environmental carcinogens are converted into DNA-reactive metabolites by phase I and phase II enzymes that are involved in the activation and detoxification of xenobiotics. Several of these enzymes display genetic polymorphisms that alter their activity leading to individual variation in DNA damage levels and thus cancer susceptibility. We investigated the relationship between DNA adduct levels and genetic polymorphisms in key enzymes of chemical carcinogenesis: CYP1A1, CYP1A2, GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP1, NQO1 and MPO. Levels of DNA adducts were determined in human breast tissue using the 32P-postlabeling method. A significantly higher adduct level was observed for individuals with the A-463 variant in the MPO gene (P=0.008), providing the first observation of an association between a predicted reduced MPO gene transcription and a higher level of DNA adducts. Furthermore, levels of DNA adducts were about 45% higher in individuals with either GSTP1*B or GSTP1*C variants compared to those homozygous for the wild-type allele. When the MPO and GSTP1 were examined together, individuals with these combined variant genotypes had significantly higher adduct levels than all other genotype combinations (P=0.003).
12611461	Reproductive factors, glutathione S-transferase M1 and T1 genetic polymorphism and breast cancer risk.	We conducted a hospital-based case-control study to evaluate the interactive effect of reproductive factors and glutathione S-transferase (GST) M1 and T1 genetic polymorphisms in individual susceptibility to breast cancer. The study population consisted of 189 incident breast cancer cases and 189 age-matched controls with no known malignant diseases. GSTM1/T1 genotypes were determined by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by conditional logistic regression model. The parity factors were grouped as (1) high-risk status defined as nullipara or para with experience of first full-term pregnancy (FFTP) at or over 30 years, and (2) low-risk status defined as para with experience of FFTP under 30 years. A significant multiplicative interaction was observed between GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes and high-risk status of parity factor in all women and in premenopausal women (P < or = 0.01), but not in postmenopausal women (P > 0.05). The interaction between the combined genotypes of GSTM1 and GSTT1 and status of parity factor was also significant in all women and in premenopausal women (P < 0.01). Our findings suggest that genetic polymorphisms GSTM1/T1 could modify estrogen-related breast cancer risk.
9726005	Study of the frequencies of CYP1A1 gene polymorphisms and glutathione S-transferase mu1 gene in primary breast cancers: an update with an additional 114 cases.	We studied the polymorphisms m1 (Msp1 restriction site) and m2 (codon Val substitution) of CYP1A1 gene and the copy number of glutathione S-transferase mu1 (GSTM1) gene on 487 DNA of breast cancer primary tumours from Caucasian group. Tumours of patients aged 55 years and under at diagnosis presented a great proportion of wild m1 (-/-) genotype; 83.6% vs. 69.5% (p < 0.0006), and a higher percentage of copy number of GSTM1 equal or under one copy; 65.2% vs. 53.4% (p < 0.011) for older patients m1 and m2 variants are closely linked (p < 0.0000). Tumour with a low copy number of GSTM1 is correlated with high histological grading (p < 0.01) and high Cathepsin D concentrations (p < 0.02). The combinations of different genotypes showed that association wild m1 (-/-) genotype and copy number of GSTM1 inferior or equal to one copy is correlated with an early onset of breast cancer primary tumour 44% vs. 6.4% for m1 (-/+) or (+/+) genotype and copy number of GSTM1 superior to one (p < 0.0000). The CYP1A1 gene wild form seems to be associated with early cancer development in Caucasian patients.
9888479	Allelotype influence at glutathione S-transferase M1 locus on breast cancer susceptibility.	The influence of polymorphisms of the glutathione S-transferase gene GSTM1 in breast cancer susceptibility has been assessed in this study. Previous studies correlated the absence of the GSTM1 protein with an increased risk of developing some cancers, especially lung or bladder cancers, in heavy smokers. In this study, we determined GSTM1 polymorphisms in a population of 437 female controls from the west of France and 361 community breast cancer patients. Three distinct alleles of this gene exist: GSTM1*A, GSTM1*B and GSTM1*0 (deleted allele). Null subjects (GSTM1 null) are homozygous for this deletion. The comparative analysis of GSTM1 allelotypes in our two populations did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in distribution (P = 0.22), although the null genotype was more frequent in cancer patients. However, breast cancer risk was increased in null subjects > or = 50 years of age compared with non-null subjects [odds ratio = 1.99 (1.19-3.32), P = 0.009], but not in null subjects < 50 years of age compared with non-null subjects (P = 0.86). Our results suggest that the GSTM1 null genotype may play a role in post-menopausal breast cancer development. They also point to a putative protective role of the A allele in the older female control group, especially in hemizygous subjects [odds ratio = 0.42 (0.23-0.77), P = 0.03].
11060339	Prognostic significance of germline BRCA2 mutations in hereditary breast cancer patients.	PURPOSE: Breast cancer in BRCA2 gene mutation carriers differs from BRCA1-associated breast cancer or so-called sporadic breast cancer in clinical features and behavior. These differences may be of importance for the prevention, screening, and ultimately treatment of breast cancer in women with such germline mutations. METHODS: We reviewed the few studies that have reported on survival in patients with BRCA2-associated breast cancer. In this article we discuss why family history is no substitute for hereditary breast cancer with regard to studying survival and possible reasons why studies using family history yield contradictory results, why BRCA2-associated breast cancer should be considered a unique entity, and what methodological problems may exist, especially with regard to family-based studies. RESULTS: Five studies have reported on survival in BRCA2-associated breast cancer. Two studies showed a statistically significant worse survival for BRCA2 patients, but the patients from one of these studies were later claimed to have a trend toward better prognosis when controls were matched for age and year of diagnosis. The other study found that the unfavorable prognosis of BRCA2 patients was, to a great extent, due to a worse stage of the disease at time of diagnosis. The remaining three studies showed no significant effect of germline BRCA2 mutations on survival. The numbers of BRCA2 patients investigated in these studies were 42, 20, 23, 28, and 54 patients. Five-year overall survival in these patients varied from 65% to 74%. CONCLUSION: No definite conclusion can be made with regard to the prognosis of BRCA2-associated breast cancer, but large differences in comparison with sporadic breast cancer are not likely to exist. Breast cancer caused by BRCA2 mutations is also a distinct entity with its own features when compared with BRCA1-associated breast cancer. In contrast with BRCA1-associated breast cancer, BRCA2 tumors tend to be more often steroid receptor-positive.
11130383	Tamoxifen and risk of contralateral breast cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers: a case-control study. Hereditary Breast Cancer Clinical Study Group.	BACKGROUND: Women with a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 have a high risk of developing breast cancer and of contralateral cancer after the initial diagnosis of breast cancer. Tamoxifen protects against contralateral breast cancer in the general population, but whether it protects against contralateral breast cancer in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers is not known. METHODS: We compared 209 women with bilateral breast cancer and BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (bilateral-disease cases), with 384 women with unilateral disease and BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (controls) in a matched case-control study. Age and age at diagnosis of breast cancer (range 24-74 years) were much the same in bilateral-disease cases and controls, and both groups had been followed up for the same time for a second primary breast cancer. History of tamoxifen use for first breast cancer was obtained by interview, or by self-administered questionnaire. FINDINGS: The multivariate odds ratio for contralateral breast cancer associated with tamoxifen use was 0.50 (95% CI 0.28-0.89). Tamoxifen protected against contralateral breast cancer for carriers of BRCA1 mutations (odds ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.19-0.74) and for those with BRCA2 mutations (0.63, 0.20-1.50). In women who used tamoxifen for 2-4 years, the risk of contralateral breast cancer was reduced by 75%. A reduction in risk of contralateral cancer was also seen with oophorectomy (0.42, 0.22-0.83) and with chemotherapy (0-40, 0.26-0.60). INTERPRETATION: Tamoxifen use reduces the risk of contralateral breast cancer in women with pathogenic mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. The protective effect of tamoxifen seems independent of that of oophorectomy.
12430181	GSTT1 null genotype increases risk of premenopausal breast cancer.	The NAT2, GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes are known candidate cancer susceptibility markers and have been investigated in breast cancer susceptibility with conflicting results. We conducted a case-control study to investigate the role of NAT2, GSTM1 and GSTT1 in premenopausal breast cancer. Women with the GSTT1 null genotype were found to have a significant 3.15-fold increased risk of breast cancer (95% CI = 1.7-5.8), while GSTM1 and NAT2 genotypes were not associated with breast cancer risk. Our results suggest that the GSTT1 null genotype may play a role in early onset breast cancer.
14504203	The interaction between alcohol consumption and GSTM1 genotype on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-DNA adduct levels in breast tissue.	We investigated the association between alcohol consumption, GSTM1 genotype, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-DNA adduct levels in breast tissue. Women referred for breast surgery were enrolled prior to surgery, responded to an interview, and gave a blood sample. Women diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive ductal or lobular cancer were defined as cases, and women with benign conditions without atypia were defined as controls. Paraffin-embedded tumor and nontumor tissue from cases and benign tissue from controls were retrieved from the pathology samples. GSTM1 genotype status was determined by PCR using WBC DNA, and PAH-DNA adduct levels were measured in breast tissue using immunohistochemistry. In tumor and nontumor tissue from cases, the GSTM1-null genotype was associated with increased adduct levels among current alcohol consumers but not among nondrinkers. In nontumor tissue, the interaction between genotype and alcohol consumption was significant (P=0.02), but in tumor tissue, the interaction did not achieve statistical significance (P=0.10). In benign tissue from controls, there was no association between genotype and adducts, regardless of drinking status. Among subjects with the null genotype who drank alcohol, adduct levels were significantly higher in tumor and nontumor tissue from cases than in benign tissue from controls. These results indicate the presence of a novel gene-lifestyle interaction that influences PAH-DNA adduct levels in breast tissue from cases but not controls. This apparent difference in PAH metabolism in response to alcohol may be an important clue as to how alcohol influences breast cancer risk.
14518733	3-D snake for US in margin evaluation for malignant breast tumor excision using Mammotome.	The goal of this paper is to use the three-dimensional (3-D) snake technique in 3-D ultrasound to obtain the tumor contour for the pre- and the post-operative malignant breast excision by the vacuum assisted biopsy instrument Mammotome. This technique of assessing the margin of two can help the physician to evaluate the effect of the surgery. By using the anisotropic diffusion filter, the noise and speckles can be reduced. Then the stick detection is adopted for enhancing the edge. Finally, the gradient vector flow (GVF) snake is used to obtain the tumor contour. These techniques are extended to the 3-D techniques to increase the accuracy and robust of segmentation results. We hope that this study can help physicians to improve the minimal invasive operation for a breast tumor.
10744635	Glutathione S-transferase M1 null genotype is associated with a decreased risk of myocardial infarction.	Tobacco smoke is a major cause of both cancer and vascular disease. Although its carcinogenic role via induction of DNA damage and mutation is well established, the mechanisms involved in vascular disease remain unclear. One possibility is that DNA damage causes smooth muscle cell proliferation in the intima of arteries, thereby contributing to atherothrombotic processes. The binding of chemicals to DNA is modulated by detoxification enzymes, including glutathione S-transferases (GST) and microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPXH). We therefore examined whether polymorphisms in these genes influence risk of cardiovascular disease. Blood was obtained from 398 patients admitted for angiographic investigation of chest pain and 196 age- and sex-matched controls. Patients were subdivided into those with and without previous acute myocardial infarction (AMI). DNA was analyzed for deletions in the GSTM1 and T1 genes and for substitutions in EPXH and GSTP1 genes. The GSTM1 null genotype occurred at a significantly lower frequency in the AMI patient group (48%) compared both to patients with no history of AMI (59%) and to the control group (57.2%). When subjects were stratified for smoking status, a significant association was observed only in smokers, suggesting the polymorphism is more important in the presence of tobacco smoke exposure. The association remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, and stenosis (presence or absence). No significant associations were observed between the other genotypes and cardiovascular disease (chi(2) test; P>0.1). The results of this study indicate that the GSTM1 null genotype is protective against AMI, an effect that is more marked in smokers. However, further study is required in order to elucidate the as yet unexplained, mechanisms underlying this association.
10779639	Polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferase genes (GSTM1, GSTP1 and GSTT1) and breast cancer susceptibility.	The glutathione S-transferase (GST) family of enzymes function in the body to detoxify carcinogenic compounds. Several genes that code for these enzymes are polymorphic, with particular genotypes previously shown to confer an increased cancer risk. In this study, we investigated the role of three GST genes (GSTM1, GSTP1 and GSTT1) in the development of sporadic breast cancer. Genotypes were determined in 129 breast cancer affected and 129 age and sex matched control individuals. Results did not support an involvement of these specific GST gene polymorphisms, either independently or in combination, in susceptibility to sporadic breast cancer in the tested Australian Caucasian population.
10861460	Ovarian and breast cancer risks to women in families with two or more cases of ovarian cancer.	There are few published estimates of the risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer in women with a strong family history of ovarian cancer. As these women commonly present to family cancer clinics, accurate cancer risk estimates are needed. We have estimated these risks in women from families with 2 or more confirmed ovarian cancers in first-degree relatives using data from the UKCCCR Familial Ovarian Cancer Register. The number of cancers observed in more than 10,000 person years of follow-up was compared with the number expected based on national-, age-, sex- and period-specific incidence rates. The relative risk of ovarian cancer was found to be 7.18 (95% CI 3.82-12.3), declining from 16.0 (6.40-32.9) in women under 50 to 4.38 (1.60-9.52) in women 50 years of age and older. For breast cancer, the relative risk for women under 50 was 3.74 (2.04-6. 28) and 1.79 (1.02-2.90) for women 50 years of age and older (average RR 2.36, 1.59-3.37). These correspond to absolute risks by age 70 of 11% for ovarian cancer and 15% for breast cancer. When the analyses were restricted to families that had been negative for mutations in the breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, the ovarian cancer risk was 11.59 (3.12-29.7) and that of breast cancer 3.32 (1.52-6.31). As well as having clinical relevance, our finding may suggest that other breast/ovarian cancer genes are segregating in these families, though the possibility of undetected BRCA1/2 mutations must also be considered.
11149425	Frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations in Japanese breast cancer families.	The purpose of this investigation is to study the frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations in Japanese breast cancer families. Mutation analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 by SSCP was conducted on the 113 breast cancer patients (probands) with at least 1 breast cancer (site-specific breast cancer families, n = 101) or 1 ovarian cancer (breast/ovarian cancer families, n = 12) patient in their first-degree relatives. Fifteen deleterious mutations (13.3%), including 8 nonsense and 7 frameshift mutations, were identified in BRCA1, and 21 deleterious mutations (18.6%), including 8 nonsense, 12 frameshift and 1 splice-site mutations, were identified in BRCA2. In site-specific breast cancer families, mutation frequency of BRCA1 or BRCA2 was high in families with 3 or more breast cancer patients (36%, 9/25), early onset (40 < or = years old) breast cancer patients (38%, 19/50) or bilateral breast cancer patients (40%, 6/15). In breast/ovarian cancer families, mutations of BRCA1 (58.3%, n = 7), but not BRCA2 (0%, n = 0), were observed. BRCA1 codon 63 (TTA to TAA) nonsense mutation and BRCA2 frameshift mutation (5802 del AATT) were observed in 4 and 7 independent families, respectively. Haplotype analysis has suggested that carriers of each of these mutations have common ancestors. These results demonstrate that family profiles are important determinants of risk for carrying a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and that cumulative frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Japanese breast cancer families (31.9%) is within the range observed in Caucasian breast cancer families. Presence of Japanese founder mutations has also been suggested.
12570745	Cancer and phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes.	Cancer development results from the interaction between genetic factors, the environment, and dietary factors have been identified as modulators of carcinogenesis process. The formation of DNA adducts is recognized as the initial step in chemical carcinogenesis. Accordingly, blocking DNA adducts formation would be the first line of defense against cancer caused by carcinogens. Glutathione-S-transferases inactivate chemical carcinogens into less toxic or inactive metabolite through reduction of DNA adducts formation. There are many different types of glutathione S-transferase isozymes. For example, GST delta serves as a marker for hepatotoxicity in rodent system, and also plays an important role in carcinogen detoxification. Therefore, inhibition of GST activity might potentiate the deleterious effects of many environmental toxicants and carcinogens. In addition, approximately half of the population lacks GST Mu expression. Epidemiological evidence showed that persons possessing this genotype are predisposed to a number of cancers including breast, prostate, liver and colon cancers. In addition, individual risk of cancer depends on the frequency of mutational events in target oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes which could lead to loss of chromosomal materials and tumor progression. The most frequent genetic alteration in a variety of human malignant tumors is the mutation of the coding sequence of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. O(6)-alkylguanine in DNA leads to very high rates of G:C deltaA:T transitions in p53 gene. These alterations will modulate the expression of p53 gene and consequently change DNA repair, cell division, and cell death by apoptosis. Also, changes in the expression of BcI-2 gene results in extended viability of cells by over-riding programmed cell death (apoptosis) induced under various conditions. The prolonged life-span increases the risk of acquiring genetic changes resulting in malignant transformation. In addition, a huge variety of food ingredients have been shown to affect cell proliferation rates. They, therefore, may either reduce or increase the risk of cancer development and progression. For example, it has been found that a high intake of dietary fat accelerates the development of breast cancer in animal models. Certain diets have been suggested to act as tumor promoters also in other types of cancer such as colon cancer, where high intake of fat and phosphate have been linked to colonic hyper-proliferation and colon cancer development. Different factors such as oncogenes, aromatic amines, alkylating agents, and diet have a significant role in cancer induction. Determination of glutathione S-transferase isozymes in plasma or serum could be used as a biomarker for cancer in different organs and could give an early detection.
12873994	Urinary isothiocyanate levels, brassica, and human breast cancer.	Brassica vegetable consumption (e.g., Chinese cabbage) provides isothiocyanates (ITC) and other glucosinolate derivatives capable of inducing Phase II enzymes [e.g., glutathione S-transferases (GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1) and NADPH quinine oxidoreductase] and apoptosis, altering steroid hormone metabolism, regulating estrogen receptor response, and stabilizing cellular proliferation. Asian populations consuming large amounts of Brassica have a lower breast cancer incidence compared with Western populations; however, the association between Brassica consumption and breast cancer risk is uncertain. It is difficult to estimate glucosinolate exposure and degradation in humans, possibly limiting epidemiological investigations of Brassica and cancer associations. We conducted a case control investigation of breast cancer in Shanghai, China, using urinary ITC levels as a biological measure of glucosinolate intake and degradation in populations with habitual Brassica intake. A representative subgroup of 337 cases providing presurgery, fasting, and first-morning urine specimens was one-to-one matched (age, menopausal status, date of urine collection, and day of laboratory assay) to population controls. Urinary ITC levels were inversely associated with breast cancer [odds ratio (OR) (Quartile 1) = 1 (ref); OR(Q2) = 0.9, 95% confidence interval (0.6, 1.4); OR(Q3) = 0.7, (0.5, 1.1); OR(Q4) = 0.5, (0.3, 0.8), adjusted for age, menopausal status, soy protein, fibroadenoma history, family breast cancer, physical activity, waist-to-hip ratio, body mass index, age at menarche, and parity in conditional logistic model]. This protective association persisted within post and premenopausal women. In contrast, total Brassica intake estimated from a food frequency questionnaire was not associated with breast cancer. Trends in the association between urinary ITC and breast cancer were more consistent with homozygous deletion of GSTM1 or GSTT1, the AAgenotype of GSTP1 (A313G), or with the C allele of NADPH quinine oxidoreductase (C609T), although interactions were not statistically significant. In conclusion, greater Brassica vegetable consumption, as measured by the urinary ITC biomarker, was associated with significantly reduced breast cancer risk among Chinese women.
8267523	[Genetic and epidemiologic studies on alcoholic liver diseases].	Polymorphic alleles of several genes such as ADH2, ALDH2, ApoB100, GST1, GST3 and ALAD were investigated from the aspect of the relationship with alcohol related diseases. DNAs were prepared from whole blood samples of 84 healthy controls (male), 70 patients (male) with alcohol related diseases and 87 patients (male) with non-alcoholic diseases. PCR technique was used for the detection of GST1 showed a good correlation to alcoholic liver diseases. The patients with alcoholic liver diseases had a higher frequency of ALDH2*1 than the healthy controls (p < 0.005). The frequencies of GST1 gene deletion in the samples were as follows: Healthy controls; 47.6%, alcoholic liver diseases (fibrosis: 75%, cirrhosis: 65.5%, hepatoma: 75%) and non-alcoholic liver diseases: 54%. The data indicated that the patients with alcoholic liver diseases had a significantly higher frequency of gene deletion than the healthy controls (p < 0.005). In addition, homozygote of ALAD1 allele detected by MpsI-RFLP showed a good correlation to alcoholic liver diseases. Thus, the genetic polymorphism of ALDH2, GST1 gene deletion and ALAD can be applied widely for the study of genetic association with alcoholic liver diseases.
8554981	Susceptibility to multiple cutaneous basal cell carcinomas: significant interactions between glutathione S-transferase GSTM1 genotypes, skin type and male gender.	The factors that determine development of single and multiple primary cutaneous basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are unclear. We describe a case-control study firstly, to examine the influence of allelism at the glutathione S-transferase GSTM1 and GSTT1 and cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 loci on susceptibility to these tumours and, secondly, to identify interactions between genotypes and relevant individual characteristics, such as skin type and gender. Frequency distributions for GSTM1 genotypes in cases and controls were not different, although the frequency of GSTM1 A/B was significantly lower (P = 0.048) in the multiple BCCs than in controls. We found no significant differences in the frequencies of GSTT1 and CYP2D6 genotypes in cases and controls. Interactions between genotypes were studied by comparing multinomial frequency distributions in mutually exclusive groups. These identified no differences between cases and controls for combinations of the putatively high risk GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null, CYP2D6 EM genotypes. Interactions between GSTM1 A/B and the CYP2D6 PM and GSTT1-positive genotypes were also not different. Frequency distributions of GSTM1 A/B with CYP2D6 EM in controls and multiple BCCs were significantly different (P = 0.033). The proportion of males in the multiple BCC group (61.3%) was greater than in controls (47.0%) and single BCC (52.2%), and the frequency of the combination GSTM1 null/male gender was significantly greater in patients with multiple tumours (P = 0.002). Frequency distributions of GSTM1 null/skin type 1 were also significantly different (P = 0.029) and the proportion of subjects who were GSTM1 null with skin type 1 was greater (P = 0.009) in the multiple BCC group. We examined the data for interactions between GSTM1 null/skin type 1/male gender by comparing frequency distributions of these factors in the single and multiple BCC groups. The distributions were almost significantly different (exact P = 0.051). No significant interactions between GSTT1 null or CYP2D6 EM and skin type 1 were identified. Comparisons of frequency distributions of smoking with the GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null and CYP2D6 EM genotypes identified no differences between patients with single and multiple tumours.
10398279	Common mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 do not contribute to early prostate cancer in Jewish men.	BACKGROUND: Families with a high incidence of hereditary breast cancer, and subsequently shown to have terminating mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, appear to have a higher incidence of prostate cancer among male relatives. We aimed to determine whether the common germline mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 in Ashkenazi Jewish men predisposed them to prostate cancer. METHODS: We examined genomic DNA from 83 (for BRCA1 185delAG) or 82 (for BRCA2 6174delT) Ashkenazi Jewish prostate cancer patients, most of whom were treated at a relatively young age, for the most common germline mutation in each gene seen in the Ashkenazi population. RESULTS: Our study should have been able to detect a 4-5-fold increase in the risk of prostate cancer due to mutation of BRCA1 or BRCA2. However, only one (1.15%; 95% confidence interval, 0-3.6%) of the patients was heterozygous for the BRCA1 mutant allele, and only two were heterozygous for the BRCA2 mutation (2.4%; 95% confidence interval, 0-6.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of each of the germline mutations in these prostate cancer patients closely matched their incidence (about 1%) in the general Ashkenazi Jewish population. This suggests that unlike cases of breast and ovarian cancers, mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 do not significantly predispose men to prostate cancer.
11700265	GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 genotypes in relation to breast cancer risk and frequency of mutations in the p53 gene.	The glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes are involved in the metabolism of various carcinogens. Deletion polymorphisms in the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes and an A-G polymorphism in the GSTP1 gene were investigated in relation to breast cancer risk in 500 breast cancer patients and 395 controls. The effects of the GST genotypes on the frequency and pattern of p53 mutations in 388 breast carcinomas were also studied. A suggestive trend of increasing risk of breast cancer with increasing number of G alleles of the GSTP1 was observed (P for trend, 0.11). The GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms did not show an association with breast cancer. No increase in risk was observed with a combination of genotypes. A statistically significant association was observed between the GSTT1 genotype and p53 mutation status of the tumors, with patients carrying the GSTT1 null genotype more frequently having mutations in the p53 gene compared with patients with a GSTT1 gene present (24.6% versus 12.4%; P = 0.019). There was also a suggestive trend for the GG genotype of the GSTP1 gene, but it was not statistically significant (P = 0.19). No association was observed with the type or location of mutations. We conclude that the GSTP1 and GSTT1 genes could play a role in carcinogenesis in the breast, possibly through increased frequency of mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as p53.
11792413	Increased risk for therapy-associated hematologic malignancies in patients with carcinoma of the breast and combined homozygous gene deletions of glutathione transferases M1 and T1.	The most serious long-term complications of anti-tumor therapy are secondary malignancies. Parameters which might allow an estimation of the individual risk to develop a therapy-induced neoplasia are urgently needed. We examined whether the genotypes of the glutathione S-transferases (GST) M1 and T1, which metabolize various cytostatic drugs, as well as reactive oxygen species, influence the risk for secondary neoplasia. In a retrospective study, we analyzed peripheral blood lymphocyte or bone marrow DNA samples from 213 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 128 with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) 44 of whom suffered from therapy-associated AML/MDS. The control group consisted of 239 healthy individuals with comparable composition as to race and sex. GSTM1 and GSTT1 were analyzed by multiplex PCR. Comparison between patients and control group revealed a significant (P=0.0003) overrepresentation of combined deletions of both GSTM1 and GSTT1 (double null genotype) in the group of patients with AML/MDS secondary to chemo- and/or radiotherapy of a carcinoma of the breast. In this group, 55% of the patients displayed the double null genotype as compared with 8.8% in the control group. We conclude that patients with carcinoma of the breast and inheritance of a combined gene deletion of GSTM1 and GSTT1 might bear an increased risk to develop a secondary therapy-induced hematologic neoplasia. An insufficient detoxification of cytostatic drugs such as cyclophosphamide is suggested to represent the underlying pathomechanism.
11899391	Prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in male breast cancer patients in Canada.	Men who inherit a mutation in the BRCA2 gene carry a 6% risk of developing breast cancer by the age of 70. The proportion of male breast cancers attributable to BRCA mutations has not yet been determined with accuracy. We studied a series of 14 male breast cancer patients, unselected for family history or ethnicity, who were treated at a single regional cancer center in Canada. Family histories were obtained, and the men were tested for germ-line mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2. Seven of these patients had a significant family history of breast cancer (i.e., at least one first- or second-degree relative with breast cancer diagnosed before age 70). Two of the men carried BRCA2 mutations, but no BRCA1 mutations were found. Both mutation carriers reported a positive family history and a personal history of cancer that preceded their diagnosis of breast cancer. Our results support the recommendation that male breast cancer patients who have a significant family history of breast or ovarian cancer should be offered genetic counseling and testing.
8033310	Aromatic DNA adducts, micronuclei and genetic polymorphism for CYP1A1 and GST1 in chimney sweeps.	Aromatic DNA adducts in total white blood cells, cytochrome P450 (CYP) class 1A1 and glutathione transferase (GST1) class mu genotypes and micronuclei in T- and B-lymphocytes were studied in 69 full-time chimney sweeps and 35 controls, all male subjects. The sweeps had a higher (22%) but statistically non-significant increase in the level of DNA adducts as compared to the controls when all individuals independent of genotype were compared. The non-inducible CYP1A1 genotype, m1/m1, lacking a MspI restriction site at the 3' end of the gene, was associated with significantly higher adduct levels in the sweeps. Among the 26 sweeps with the combined genotype m1/m1 and GST1(-), a statistically significant 60% increase in median adduct levels was observed as compared with those 14 control subjects with the corresponding genotype. Smoking also showed a significant effect on the level of adducts. The effect on DNA adducts by sweeping, smoking and genotype appeared to be additive and independent of each other. DNA adducts in sweeps were moderately but statistically significantly correlated with micronuclei in both T- and B-lymphocytes. The correlation between adduct levels and micronuclei was most marked in T-lymphocytes of individuals lacking the GST1 gene.
8751855	Genetic heterogeneity in hereditary breast cancer: role of BRCA1 and BRCA2.	The common hereditary forms of breast cancer have been largely attributed to the inheritance of mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. However, it is not yet clear what proportion of hereditary breast cancer is explained by BRCA1 and BRCA2 or by some other unidentified susceptibility gene(s). We describe the proportion of hereditary breast cancer explained by BRCA1 or BRCA2 in a sample of North American hereditary breast cancers and assess the evidence for additional susceptibility genes that may confer hereditary breast or ovarian cancer risk. Twenty-three families were identified through two high-risk breast cancer research programs. Genetic analysis was undertaken to establish linkage between the breast or ovarian cancer cases and markers on chromosomes 17q (BRCA1) and 13q (BRCA2). Mutation analysis in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes was also undertaken in all families. The pattern of hereditary cancer in 14 (61%) of the 23 families studied was attributed to BRCA1 by a combination of linkage and mutation analyses. No families were attributed to BRCA2. Five families (22%) provided evidence against linkage to both BRCA1 and BRCA2. No BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations were detected in these five families. The BRCA1 or BRCA2 status of four families (17%) could not be determined. BRCA1 and BRCA2 probably explain the majority of hereditary breast cancer that exists in the North American population. However, one or more additional genes may yet be found that explain some proportion of hereditary breast cancer.
9815734	Relation of glutathione S-transferase alpha and mu isoforms to response to therapy in human breast cancer.	Glutathione S-transferase (GST) represents a multifunctional enzyme family consisting of four known cytosolic isoforms (alpha, mu, pi, and Phi) that detoxify a variety of xenobiotic chemicals and may confer resistance to both chemotherapeutic drugs and carcinogens in various experimental models. GST-pi has already been extensively studied in clinical specimens, including breast cancer. We studied the immuno-histochemical distribution and relative immunopositivity of GST-alpha and GST-mu, based on a grading system for immunointensity, in samples of 51 neoplastic and 46 normal breast samples and 12 lymph node metastases from patients treated with intensive chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant. In normal breast tissue, GST-alpha localized predominantly to the cytoplasm of scattered cells lining the luminal aspects of the ducts. Occasional cells showed both cytoplasmic and nuclear GST-alpha immunoreactivity. GST-mu was stained in myoepithelial cells preferentially as well as in occasional ductal cells (including apocrine epithelium), vascular smooth muscle, and plasma cells. GST-alpha and GST-mu were detected in 22 of 51 (43%) and 24 of 48 (50%) invasive cancers, respectively. In paired samples of normal and malignant tissue from the same patient, GST-alpha immunostaining in cancers was significantly less intense compared to that of normal breast tissue in 13 of 41 (32%) cases. No such trend was found for GST-mu in paired samples. Neither GST-alpha nor GST-mu immunopositivity in tumor or nonneoplastic breast was found to correlate with relapse-free or overall survival in this clinical context; however, the apparent decreased expression of GST-alpha in malignant versus normal breast epithelial cells could have important implications in breast carcinogenesis.
10868690	Glutathione S-transferases M1, T1, and P1 and breast cancer.	We examined associations for glutathione S-transferases M1 (GSTM1), T1 (GSTT1), and P1 (GSTP1) genotypes and breast cancer in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, a population-based, case-control study in North Carolina. Odds ratios were close to the null value for each GST locus among African-American women (278 cases and 271 controls) and white women (410 cases and 392 controls), as well as pre- and postmenopausal women. For women with a history of breast cancer in one or more first-degree relatives, odds ratios were 2.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.0-4.2) for GSTM1 null and 1.9 (0.8-4.6) for GSTT1 null genotypes. Among women with a family history, age at diagnosis was significantly earlier for those with the GSTM1 null genotype. We did not observe strong evidence for modification of odds ratios for smoking according to GST genotypes. There was no evidence for combined effects of GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 genotypes, and there were no combined effects for GST genotypes and the catechol O-methyltransferase genotype. We conclude that GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 genotypes do not play a strong role in susceptibility to breast cancer. However, the role of GST genotypes in age at onset and risk of breast cancer among women with a family history merits further investigation.
11015213	Equilibrium folding of dimeric class mu glutathione transferases involves a stable monomeric intermediate.	The conformational stabilities of two homodimeric class mu glutathione transferases (GSTM1-1 and GSTM2-2) were studied by urea- and guanidinium chloride-induced denaturation. Unfolding is reversible and structural changes were followed with far-ultraviolet circular dichroism, tryptophan fluorescence, enzyme activity, chemical cross-linking, and size-exclusion chromatography. Disruption of secondary structure occurs as a monophasic transition and is independent of protein concentration. Changes in tertiary structure occur as two transitions; the first is protein concentration dependent, while the second is weakly dependent (GSTM1-1) or independent (GSTM2-2). The second transition corresponds with the secondary structure transition. Loss in catalytic activity occurs as two transitions for GSTM1-1 and as one transition for GSTM2-2. These transitions are dependent upon protein concentration. The first deactivation transition coincides with the first tertiary structure transition. Dimer dissociation occurs prior to disruption of secondary structure. The data suggest that the equilibrium unfolding/refolding of the class mu glutathione transferases M1-1 and M2-2 proceed via a three-state process: N(2) <--> 2I <--> 2U. Although GSTM1-1 and GSTM2-2 are homologous (78% identity/94% homology), their N(2) tertiary structures are not identical. Dissociation of the GSTM1-1 dimer to structured monomers (I) occurs at lower denaturant concentrations than for GSTM2-2. The monomeric intermediate for GSTM1-1 is, however, more stable than the intermediate for GSTM2-2. The intermediates are catalytically inactive and display nativelike secondary structure. Guanidinium chloride-induced denaturation yields monomeric intermediates, which have a more loosely packed tertiary structure displaying enhanced solvent exposure of its tryptophans and enhanced ANS binding. The three-state model for the class mu enzymes is in contrast to the equilibrium two-state models previously proposed for representatives of classes alpha/pi/Sj26 GSTs. Class mu subunits appear to be intrinsically more stable than those of the other GST classes.
8880755	Binding of Tyr-W-MIF-1 (Tyr-Pro-Trp-Gly-NH2) and related peptides to mu 1 and mu 2 opiate receptors.	Two endogenous brain peptides (Tyr-W-MIF-1 (Tyr-Pro-Trp-Gly-NH2) and Tyr-MIF-1 (Tyr-Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2)), a cyclized analog and two fragments of Tyr-W-MIF-1, and hemorphin (Tyr-Pro-Trp-Thr) were tested for binding to mu 1 and mu 2 opiate receptor. All these peptides bound to both mu 1 and mu 2 sites in assays optimized to discriminate these subtypes of the mu opiate receptor in membranes from bovine thalamus. The cyclized analog of Tyr-W-MIF-1, previously shown to have potency near that of Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-N-MePhe-Gly-ol (DAMGO) and morphine in producing analgesia after intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection, bound to mu 1 and mu 2 sites with affinities similar to those of DAMGO. Tyr-W-MIF-1, previously shown to induce analgesia after i.c.v. injection but with much higher potency after intrathecal (i.t.) injection, also bound to both mu 1 and mu 2 sites with an affinity between that of morphiceptin and hemorphin. Although the highest ratios of Ki's for mu 2/mu 1 were shown by hemorphin, Tyr-W-MIF-1, and Tyr-W-MIF-1, none of the compounds were significantly different in selectivity. The results indicate that the relatively lower potency of Tyr-W-MIF-1 after i.c.v., compared with i.t. injection, is not due to a lack of binding to mu 1 sites. They suggest that it has relatively high efficacy at mu 2, but low efficacy at mu 1 sites, a possibility that might explain some of the novel properties of these peptides.
9678617	Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase, CA15-3, CA125, and CEA in cancer patients.	Peripheral blood leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) scores and CA15-3, CA125, and CEA levels in plasma were measured in 57 patients with metastatic breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer, respectively, and in 79 patients with the same types of nonmetastatic cancer. The mean LAP scores of the metastatic cancer patients (261, 272 and 275 for breast, ovary and colon, respectively) were significantly higher than those of the nonmetastatic cancer group (70, 68 and 57, respectively). There was no overlap between the 95% confidence intervals of the two groups (i.e., metastatic versus nonmetastatic), and no patient known to be metastatic had a LAP score within the normal range. The mean levels of other markers in the metastatic patients (CA15-3, 63.4 mu/ml; CA125, 104.8 mu/ml; and CEA, 51.8 ng/ml for metastatic breast, ovarian, and colon cancer, respectively) were also higher than in the nonmetastatic patients (CA15-3, 24 mu/ml; CA125, 25.3 mu/ml; and CEA, 5.8 ng/ml for nonmetastatic breast, ovarian, and colon cancer, respectively). However, the 95% confidence intervals of the nonmetastatic and the metastatic patients overlapped so that there were false-negatives and/or false-positives when the other markers were used. We therefore conclude that the addition of the LAP score to conventional cancer markers could be helpful for the diagnosis of recurrence and follow-up of cancer patients and suggest that our results be confirmed by further studies on a larger series of patients.
10029576	Susceptibility to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: influence of CYP1A1, CYP2D6, GSTM1, and GSTT1 genetic polymorphisms.	Although acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer, factors governing susceptibility to this disease have not yet been identified. As such, ALL offers a useful opportunity to examine the glutathione S-transferase and cytochrome P450 genes in determining susceptibility to pediatric cancers. Both enzymes are involved in carcinogen metabolism and have been shown to influence the risk a variety of solid tumors in adults. To determine whether these genes played a similar role in childhood leukemogenesis, we compared the allele frequencies of 177 childhood ALL patients and 304 controls for the CYP1A1, CYP2D6, GSTM1, and GSTT1 genes. We chose the French population of Quebec as our study population because of its relative genetic homogeneity. The GSTM1 null and CYP1A1*2A genotypes were both found to be significant predictors of ALL risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8). Those possessing both genotypes were at an even greater risk of developing the disease (OR = 3.3). None of the other alleles tested for proved to be significant indicators of ALL risk. Unexpectedly, girls carrying the CYP1A1*4 were significantly underrepresented in the ALL group (OR = 0.2), suggesting that a gender-specific protective role exists for this allele. These results suggest that the risk of ALL may indeed be associated with xenobiotics-metabolism, and thus with environmental exposures. Our findings may also explain, in part, why ALL is more prevalent among males than females.
10821441	Glutathione S-transferase polymorphism in Parkinson's disease.	Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are involved in the detoxification of endogenous or exogenous toxins, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. We genotyped the Glutathione-S-Transferase isoenzymes GSTM1 and GSTT1 by polymerase chain reaction in order to evaluate different gene polymorphisms of these isoenzymes in 149 parkinsonian and 99 control subjects. No differences appeared between both groups regarding the frequencies of the homozygous deletion of GSTM1 (odds ratio 1.021; 95% CI [0.613; 1.699], p < 0.521 Fisher's exact test) and GSTT1 (odds ratio 1.514; 95% CI [0.811; 2.824], p < 0.127). Age of onset of PD did not correlate to GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms. These results do not support the hypothesis of a possible impact of GSTM1 and GSTT1 detoxification activities in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.
11003560	BRCA1 and BRCA2--breast cancer susceptibility genes.	Genetic predisposition is responsible for 5% 10% of all breast cancer cases. Therefore, the inherited susceptibility to breast cancer has been intensively investigated during the last 10 years. In particular, the identification of the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 (breast cancer gene 1) and BRCA2 and the current genetic testing for mutations in both genes are the basis for estimating disease risks for women with a strong family history of breast cancer and will provide important information on the prevention and treatment of familial breast cancer.
11734330	BRCA2: a genetic risk factor for breast cancer.	The identification of the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 a few years ago has been greeted with great excitement and has raised hopes that they might illuminate the common mechanisms of this disease. Today we have to recognize that these expectations remain unfulfilled. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account only for a relatively small proportion of breast cancers, even within the group of familiar clusters, they seem to be virtually non-existing in sporadic breast cancers. A substantial proportion of familiar breast cancer clusters has failed to provide evidence for an association with mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2, thus we have to look forward to the identification of additional breast cancer susceptibility genes. What has been most disappointing is that the mutation status of BRCA1/2 can provide only limited information for cancer risk. Initial assessments had indicated a risk of close to 90% for mutation carriers to develop breast cancer until age 75 - a value that turned out to be restricted to high-risk families in which the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes had been genomically mapped. In unselected clusters the risk appears much lower, some estimates suggest less than 40%. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 large encode proteins that appear to have a plethora of functions, with a conspicuous association to DNA repair and DNA recombination, and probably transcription activation. Defects in DNA repair can result in cancer predisposition syndromes and are recognized as being instrumental in cancer progression. Central questions have remained unanswered: What is the function of damaged BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in breast cancer risk? What is the basis of large variations of risk conferred to the patients by identical mutations? How can the predictive value of mutation surveys be increased?
12242696	Protein kinases in mammary gland development and cancer.	Protein kinases, the enzymes responsible for phosphorylation of a wide variety of proteins, are the largest class of genes known to regulate growth, development, and neoplastic transformation of mammary gland. Mammary gland growth and maturation consist of a series of highly ordered events involving interactions among several distinct cell types that are regulated by complex interactions among many steroid hormones and growth factors. The mammary gland is one of the few organ systems in mammals that complete their morphologic development postnatally during two discrete physiologic states, puberty and pregnancy. Thus, the mammary gland is an excellent model for studying normal development and the early steps of tumor formation. The susceptibility of the mammary gland to tumorigenesis is influenced by its normal development, particularly during stages of puberty and pregnancy. Numerous experimental and epidemiological studies have suggested that specific details in the development of the mammary gland play a critical role in breast cancer risk. Mammary gland development is characterized by dynamic changes in the expression and functions of protein kinases. Perturbations in the regulated expression or function of protein kinases or their associated signaling pathways can lead to malignant transformation of the breast. For example, overexpression of several receptor-tyrosine kinases, including human epidermal growth factor receptor and HER2/Neu, has been shown to contribute to the development of breast cancer. Since receptor-tyrosine kinases regulate several essential processes such as mitogenesis, motility, invasion, cell survival, and angiogenesis, targeting receptor-tyrosine kinases may have important implications in designing strategies against breast cancer.
12925969	Risk modification by CYP1A1 and GSTM1 polymorphisms in the association of environmental tobacco smoke and lung cancer: a case-control study in Japanese nonsmoking women.	Genetic backgrounds may modify the association of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) with lung cancer risk. Polymorphisms of both the activating and detoxifying enzymes, cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) and glutathione-S-transferase M1 (GSTM1), may be important as genetic factors. We conducted a multicenter case-control study in Japanese nonsmoking women. Cases were women aged 30-89 years and newly diagnosed as having lung cancer from November 1997 to March 2001 in 4 study areas. We also recruited age-matched (5-year strata) and hospital-matched nonsmoking controls. A total of 158 cases and 259 hospital controls supplied blood for genotyping. Detailed information on ETS exposure from husbands and that in other situations and on potential confounders was collected by interview. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated by using conditional logistic models. We found no increase in the risk of lung cancer for CYP1A1 Msp I genotypes. For the GSTM1 null genotype vs. nonnull genotype, the OR was 1.37 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90-2.09], which indicated a somewhat increased risk for the GSTM1 null genotype. A gene-environment interaction was suggested, with combined GSTM1 null genotype and high-dose ETS exposure (>/=40 pack-years by husbands) conferring significantly higher risk (OR = 2.27, 95% CI 1.13-4.57) compared to the GSTM1 nonnull genotype and low-dose ETS exposure (<40 pack-years). Our results do not support a major role of Msp I polymorphism of the CYP1A1 gene as a risk factor for lung cancer among nonsmoking women. In contrast, the GSTM1 null genotype posed an increased, although not significant, risk among them. Additional studies are warranted to confirm the ETS-GSTM1 polymorphism interaction suggested in our present study.
14504191	Detection of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]-pyridine-DNA adducts in normal breast tissues and risk of breast cancer.	2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]-pyridine (PhIP), the most abundant heterocyclic amine (HCA) in cooked food, is a mammary carcinogen in female rats. In humans, consumption of well-done meat and PhIP intake have been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, but PhIP-DNA adducts have not been analyzed in breast tissues from women having unknown exposure to HCAs. Using an immunohistochemistry (IHC) method, we measured PhIP-DNA adducts in normal breast tissues of 106 women having newly diagnosed breast cancer in comparison with those of 49 women undergoing reduction mammoplasty. The IHC method was first validated in MCF-7 cells treated with different doses of N-hydroxy-PhIP. We detected significant dose-response relationship and correlation (r=0.94) between the levels of PhIP-DNA adducts detected by IHC and 32P-postlabeling. Using IHC, PhIP-DNA adducts were detected in 82 and 71% of the normal breast tissue sections from the cancer and control patients respectively. The median (range) absorbance was 0.18 (0-0.57) and 0.08 (0-0.38) in the cancer and control patients, respectively (P<0.001). Using the median in the controls as a cutoff point, 71% of the cancer patients and 47% of the controls were distributed in the higher range (chi2=8.17; P=0.004). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated an OR of 4.03 (95% CI, 1.41-11.53) after adjusting for age and ethnicity (P=0.009). Stratified analyses did not find any significant effect of age, ethnicity, smoking, well-done meat consumption, dietary intake of PhIP, or polymorphisms of CYP1A1, CYP1B1, NAT2, and GSTM1 genes on the level of PhIP-DNA adducts. However, a potential interactive effect of well-done meat consumption and NAT2 genotype on the level of PhIP-DNA adducts was observed (P=0.047). This is the first study of detection of PhIP-DNA adducts in breast tissue samples obtained from women having unknown exposure to HCAs. These data strongly support the hypothesis that HCA exposure contributes to human breast cancer among genetically susceptible individuals.
9829708	Glutathione S-transferase GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms and colorectal cancer risk: a prospective study.	Glutathione S-transferase (GST) M1 and T1 genes encode GST enzymes, and are polymorphic in humans. These enzymes catalyze conjugation with glutathione, which is an important step in the detoxification of certain carcinogens. Several case-control studies have found associations of the homozygous null deletions in GSTM1 and GSTT1 with increasing the risk of colorectal and lung cancer. We prospectively examined the associations of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms with colorectal cancer risk in a nested case-control study (212 cases of colorectal cancer and 221 controls) within the Physicians' Health Study. Among controls, the prevalence of the GSTM1 homozygous null genotype was 53% and for GSTT1 homozygous null genotype, 23%. We found no increase in the risk of colorectal cancer for either GSTM1 null [odds ratio (OR) = 1.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.7-1.5] or GSTT1 null (OR = 0.8; 95% CI, 0.5-1.2) genotypes. No differences were seen by site of colon cancer (proximal versus distal) or by age (< or = 60 years versus > 60 years). Current cigarette smokers with GSTM1 null genotype were not at an increased risk of colon cancer (OR = 1.2; 95% CI, 0.3-4.2) compared with current smokers without the null genotype; for the GSTT1 null genotype this OR was 1.1 = 95% CI (0.3-4.7). This lack of association persisted when we examined pack-years of smoking and age at starting smoking. Our results do not support an association of GSTM1 or GSTT1 polymorphisms with colorectal cancer or an interaction with cigarette smoking.
11408954	Genetic polymorphisms and transcriptional pattern analysis of CYP1A1, AhR, GSTM1, GSTP1 and GSTT1 genes in breast cancer.	In order to detect the contribution of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), glutathione S-transferases M1 (GSTM1), P1 (GSTP1), and T1 (GSTT1) genes in breast cancer, genetic analysis was performed, as well as transcriptional analysis in sporadic primary tumours and corresponding adjacent normal tissues from the same patient. CYP1A1 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) termed as m1 (MspI) polymorphism and the null(-) deletions of both GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes were examined in genomic DNA from blood samples of 207 female breast cancer patients and 171 age and sex matched controls. The frequencies of the m1 genotype of the CYP1A1 gene in cases and controls were 0.13 and 0.15, while the frequencies of homozygotes with GSTM1(-) were 0.52, in each, and for homozygotes with GSTT1(-) were 0.14 and 0.10, respectively. Statistical analysis of these genotypes in combinations did not reveal any significant difference between the breast cancer population and the control group. Expression of mRNA levels of CYP1A1, GSTM1, GSTP1, GSTT1 and AhR genes in 31 breast cancer patients, revealed inter-individual variation in an independent manner to patient age, genotype, or tumour stage. Eighty-seven percent of the tumour specimens tested were deregulated, compared to their normal counterparts, in at least one locus. Up-regulation of CYP1A1 was observed only when one of the GSTM1 or GSTP1 was down-regulated while the other remained constant. Genotyping analysis did not show any correlation to breast cancer risk. However, RT-PCR analysis provided evidence that CYP1A1, AhR, GSTM1, GSTP1 and GSTT1 genes are frequently deregulated in breast cancer and could be used as molecular biomarkers for better clinical management of such patients, with respect to chemotherapy.
11597316	The E-cadherin/catenin complex: an important gatekeeper in breast cancer tumorigenesis and malignant progression.	E-cadherin is a cell-cell adhesion protein fulfilling a prominent role in epithelial differentiation. Data from model systems suggest that E-cadherin is a potent invasion/tumor suppressor of breast cancer. Consistent with this role in breast cancer progression, partial or complete loss of E-cadherin expression has been found to correlate with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. The E-cadherin gene (CDH1) is located on human chromosome 16q22.1, a region frequently affected with loss of heterozygosity in sporadic breast cancer. Invasive lobular breast carcinomas, which are typically completely E-cadherin-negative, often show inactivating mutations in combination with loss of heterozygosity of the wild-type CDH1 allele. Mutations were found at early noninvasive stages, thus associating E-cadherin mutations with loss of cell growth control and defining CDH1 as the tumor suppressor for the lobular breast cancer subtype. Ductal breast cancers in general show heterogeneous loss of E-cadherin expression, associated with epigenetic transcriptional downregulation. It is proposed that the microenvironment at the invasive front is transiently downregulating E-cadherin transcription. This can be associated with induction of nonepithelial cadherins.
8250963	Stereoselectivity of human liver and intestinal cytosolic fractions as well as purified human glutathione S-transferase isoenzymes towards 2-bromoisovalerylurea enantiomers.	Glutathione (GSH) conjugation of 2-bromoisovalerylurea (BIU) enantiomers is stereoselective in humans in vivo. Administration of racemic BIU results in a higher plasma elimination and urinary excretion of R-BIU and its mercapturate, respectively, than of S-BIU and its mercapturate. In order to relate the in vivo BIU pharmacokinetics to the activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) isoenzymes, the GSH conjugation of BIU enantiomers was studied with human liver and intestinal cytosolic fractions as well as purified human class alpha (GSTA1-1, GSTA2-2), mu (GSTM1a-1a) and pi (GSTP1-1) GST isoenzymes. Stereoselective GSH conjugation of BIU enantiomers was observed for most human liver and intestinal cytosolic fraction. In general, the cytosolic fractions preferentially conjugated S-BIU. Stereoselective preference for GSH conjugation of S-BIU was also observed for GSTA2-2 and GSTM1a-1a, whereas GSTA1-1 was not selective for either of the BIU enantiomers. GSTP1-1 did not catalyse conjugation of R- and S-BIU. Quantification of the GST isoenzymes in the liver cytosolic fractions showed that the stereoselectivity towards S-BIU was related to the profile and amount of GST subunits in the cytosolic fractions. The discrepancy in stereoselectivity between the BIU pharmacokinetics in vivo and the GSH conjugation of BIU enantiomers in vitro is discussed. In addition, since in contrast to human GSTM1a-1a, rat class Mu isoenzymes prefer R-BIU, the present results indicate that related isoenzymes in different species may have a different stereoselectivity.
9683359	Response to radiation therapy and prognosis in breast cancer patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate overall survival in BRCA1 or BRCA2 breast cancer patients, describe presenting stage, review histologic findings and evaluate response to radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed evaluating breast cancer patients with known mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2. Patients from 12 different pedigrees were cross-referenced with the Utah Cancer Registry (UCR), histologic findings were verified and radiotherapy records were reviewed for acute response to treatment. Actuarial survival calculations were performed and patients were matched for age, date of diagnosis and tumor size. RESULTS: Thirty breast cancer patients with BRCA1 mutations were found to have 34 breast cancers (four had bilateral metachronous lesions) and 20 breast cancer patients with BRCA2 mutations were found to have 22 breast cancers (two had bilateral metachronous disease). The median age at diagnosis was 49 years (range 21-77 years) and 42 years (range 23-83 years), respectively, for BRCA1 and BRCA2 patients. Unusual histologic types of breast cancers were represented with 7% (4/56) medullary and 5% (3/56) lobular carcinomas. Complete staging was possible for 63% (35/56) of cancers. Stages I, II, III and IV represented 26, 63, 6 and 6% of cancers, respectively. The most severe radiation reaction was moist desquamation which was self-limiting and developed in 29% (6/21) of irradiated patients. The mean follow-up was 9.8 and 7.5 years for BRCA1 and BRCA2 cancers, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated 5-year survival values of 75% for BRCA1 patients, 73% for BRCA2 patients, 70% for matched controls and 69% for UCR controls. No statistically significant differences were evident between the groups at 5 or 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Despite their younger age at presentation, breast cancer patients harboring BRCAI or BRCA2 mutations present at a similar stage, display a normal acute reaction to radiotherapy and have a similar prognosis when compared with sporadic breast cancer patients.
9825836	Single tube multiplex polymerase chain reaction genotype analysis of GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1: relation of genotypes to TP53 tumor status and clinicopathological variables in breast cancer patients.	Glutathione S-transferases are involved in the conjugation of a number of human carcinogens. The frequencies of the deletion alleles coding for GSTM1, and GSTT1, related to deficient conjugation of xenobiotics, as well as a recently reported variant in the exon 5 of GSTP1 were investigated in this study. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction based method for a rapid and high throughput genotype analysis of all three GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 genes in a single tube was developed. Leukocyte DNA from two hundred and thirty-nine (n = 239) breast cancer patients were genotyped. Tumors from a subset of these breast cancer patients (n = 131) have previously been investigated for mutations in the TP53 gene, levels of p53 protein accumulation and loss of heterozygosity at several loci on chromosome 17. When genetic alterations in the tumors were analyzed with respect to glutathione S-transferase genotypes, a significantly higher proportion of the patients with a G allele (GG + AG) of the GSTP1 had loss of heterozygosity at the TP53 gene locus mapping to 17p, compared with non-G allele carriers (74% versus 29%) (P = 0.018). The patients carrying the G allele of GSTP1 also had more frequently mutations in the TP53 gene in their tumor (38%), compared with patients with the AA genotype (21%) (P = 0.055). G allele carriers had predominantly deletion or transversion mutations in the TP53 gene (5 of 7 and 5 of 6 respectively). A higher frequency of the G allele carriers was observed among patients with negative lymph node status (P = 0.0004). A higher proportion of the patients with positive lymph node status at the time of diagnosis had a combined GSTM1 null/GSTT1 null genotype (P = 0.05). Patients who were homozygous for the deleted GSTM1 allele were found to have a significantly shorter overall survival (P = 0.036).
10359869	[The mutation of deletion for glutathione S-transferase M1 gene in the tissue of hepatocellular carcinoma].	OBJECTIVE: To Study whether the mutation of deletion for glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) gene occurred during the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: The genotypes of GSTM1 of 46 pairs of HCC tissue and the noncancerous liver tissue were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The frequency of GSTM1 null genotype for HCC tissue was 78.26%, but 65.22% for the noncancerous liver tissue (P<0.05). The GSTM1 null genotypes of 6 HCC tissue were transformed from the non- null genotypes of the noncancerous liver tissue. According to Hardy-Weinberg law., the rate of deletion mutation for GSTM1 gene was inferred to be 38.89%. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that the mutation of deletion for GSTM1 gene had occurred during the development of HCC.
10493261	The glutathione S-transferases: influence of polymorphism on cancer susceptibility.	The glutathione S-transferase supergene family is an important part of cellular enzymic defence against endogenous and exogenous chemicals, many of which have a carcinogenic potential. However, while a wide variety of chemicals can act as substrates for different members of the supergene family, the precise function of these enzymes remains unclear. The supergene family comprises several gene families that include polymorphic loci, prompting the hypothesis that allelic variants associated with less effective detoxification of potential carcinogens can confer an increased susceptibility to cancer. For example, the null genotypes at the mu class GSTM1 and theta class GSTT1 loci have attracted particular interest, and recently identified allelic variants at the mu class GSTM3 and pi class GSTP1 loci are also putative susceptibility candidates. However, while associations between GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes and risk have been observed in some case-control studies in lung, bladder and colon cancers, other studies have reported contrary findings, and the importance of these polymorphisms in mediating the risk of smoking-related cancers remains generally unproven. We describe the influence of glutathione S-transferase polymorphisms on the risk of several cancers, including basal cell carcinoma of skin. In the latter cancer, associations between tumour numbers, site and accrual have been observed, suggesting a role for GST enzymes in the detoxification of the products of ultraviolet radiation-induced oxidative stress. We review below current knowledge of polymorphism in GST loci, possible in vivo GST substrates, and the difficulties of determining the role of this complex gene family on the basis of available epidemiological data.
12296511	Cigarette smoking, glutathione-s-transferase M1 and t1 genetic polymorphisms, and breast cancer risk (United States).	OBJECTIVE: It has been suggested that functional polymorphisms in genes encoding tobacco carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes may modify the relationship between tobacco smoking and breast cancer risk. We sought to determine if there is a gene-environment interaction between GSTM I (GSTM1A and GSTM1B), and GSTT1 genotypes and cigarette smoking in the risk of breast cancer. METHODS: Cases and controls were recruited in a case-control study conducted in Connecticut from 1994 to 1998. Cases were histologically confirmed, incident breast cancer patients, and controls were randomly selected from women histologically confirmed to be without breast cancer. A total of 338 cases and 345 controls were genotyped for GSTM1 and GSTT1 . RESULTS: None of the GSTM 1 genotypes, either alone or in combination with cigarette smoking, was associated with breast cancer risk. There was, however, a significantly increased risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women with a GSTTI null genotype (OR= 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-2.9). There were also indications of increased risk of breast cancer associated with cigarette smoking for postmenopausal women with GSTT1-null genotype, especially for those who commenced smoking before age 18 (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.0-8.8). CONCLUSION: Women with a GSTT1-null genotype may have an increased breast cancer risk, especially postmenopausal women who started smoking at younger ages.
9424615	[Value of MR tomography in inconclusive mammography findings].	PURPOSE: To evaluate the usefulness of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the assessment of inconclusive findings at mammography, such as indeterminate focal or diffuse breast abnormalities, post-treatment breasts with extensive scarring, dense breasts, and findings suggesting multifocal or multicentric breast cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 254 patients underwent mammography, sonography, and MRI of the breast. Dynamic MR imaging was done using a thin-section three-dimensional gradient-echo sequence (FLASH, TR = 11.8 ms; TE = 5 ms; flip angle = 25 degrees) which was applied in a dynamic fashion before and every 90 seconds after injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Diagnoses were confirmed at biopsy (n = 165) or by follow-up (n = 89). RESULTS: Among various breast anomalies, the highest proportion of breast cancers was associated with dense breast tissue (27.8%), architectural distortion (26.9%), and irregular scars (15.8%). Sensitivity of dynamic MR imaging was 93.7%, and specificity was 83.3%. As compared to mammography and sonography, MR detected 6 occult carcinomas, and showed additional malignant lesions in 19/63 women (30.2%) with biopsy-proven breast cancer. CONCLUSION: MR imaging of the breast may provide valuable additional information in indeterminate breast anomalies. However, because of its inherent limitations, it should not replace core needle biopsy in all lesions which are amenable to biopsy. Because of its high sensitivity in the detection of invasive carcinomas in any type of breast tissue, MR imaging is considered the modality of choice in the evaluation of dense breasts in high-risk patients or in patients with clinical suspicion of occult breast cancer, and for preoperative tumor staging.
10334189	Glutathione S-transferase M1 and T1 null genotypes as risk factors for oral leukoplakia in ethnic Indian betel quid/tobacco chewers.	Oral cancer is the most common cancer in males and third most common in females in India, the main causative agent being the use of chewing tobacco with or without betel quid (BQ). However, nothing is known about the role of the host metabolic genes in oral cancer in ethnic Indian population. In this study, the prevalence of GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes (GSTM1*2 and GSTT1*2) in oral premalignant leukoplakia cases and controls was ascertained in genomic DNA by a multiplex PCR technique. Biopsies taken from 98 oral leukoplakia patients and exfoliated cells from 82 healthy controls both of Indian ethnicity were analysed. GSTM1*1 (active) was present in 83% and GSTT1*1 (active) was present in 78% of all control subjects, while prevalence of GSTM1*2 and GSTT1*2 null genotypes was significantly higher among oral leukoplakia cases. The prevalence of GSTM1*2 in leukoplakia cases was 81.6% compared with 17% in controls [odds ratio (OR), 22; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1047] and GSTT1*2 was 75.5% in the cases versus 22% in controls (OR, 11; 95% CI, 5-22). Combined null genotypes of GSTM1 and GSTT1 prevailed in 60.2% of the cases with none detected in controls. Glutathione S-transferase M1 and T1 enzymes are both known to catalyse detoxification of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation products and tobacco-derived carcinogens that have been found in the saliva of BQ/tobacco chewers. Our results, still requiring confirmation by a larger study, demonstrate that the null genotypes of both GSTM1 and GSTT1 increase with high penetrance, separately or in combination, the risk for developing leukoplakia in an Indian ethnic population.
11520364	Subsequent endometrial carcinoma with adjuvant tamoxifen treatment in Japanese breast cancer patients.	This study aimed to detail the clinicopathologic features of endometrial carcinomas that developed in Japanese patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen treatment for breast cancer patients. Ten endometrial carcinomas in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients were collected from two medical centers. The endometrial carcinomas included two stage Ia, four stage Ib, two stage Ic and two stage IIIc. Three tumors were Grade 1, six were Grade 2, and one was Grade 3. The tumor was limited to the endometrium in two cases. Myometrial invasion was limited to the inner half of the myometrium in five cases and involved the outer half in three. A mild degree of lymphovascular space invasion was identified in five cases. Deep cervical invasion was recognized in one case. The cell types comprised nine endometrioid adenocarcinomas and one serous carcinoma. Five of eight postmenopausal endometrial carcinomas were associated with polypoid endometrial lesions composed of cystically dilated atrophic and proliferative glands widely separated by fibrotic stroma. Two patients with retroperitoneal lymph node metastases died of endometrial cancer. One patient developed a contralateral breast cancer during tamoxifen treatment. No patient died of breast cancer. We did not demonstrate a higher frequency of either high-grade tumors or unfavorable histologic subtypes in tamoxifen-treated Japanese breast cancer patients.
11737885	PTEN deficiency: a role in mammary carcinogenesis.	The PTEN gene is often mutated in primary human tumors and cell lines, but the low rate of somatic PTEN mutation in human breast cancer has led to debate over the role of this tumor suppressor in this disease. The involvement of PTEN in human mammary oncogenesis has been implicated from studies showing that germline PTEN mutation in Cowden disease predisposes to breast cancer, the frequent loss of heterozygosity at the PTEN locus, and reduced PTEN protein levels in sporadic breast cancers. To assay the potential contribution of PTEN loss in breast tumor promotion, Li et al. [1] crossed Pten heterozygous mice with mouse mammary tumor virus-Wnt-1 transgenic (Wnt-1 TG, Pten+/-) mice. Mammary ductal carcinoma developed earlier in Wnt-1 TG, Pten+/- mice than in mice bearing either genetic change alone, and showed frequent loss of the remaining wild-type PTEN allele. These data indicate a role for PTEN in breast tumorigenesis in an in vivo model.
9122892	Glutathione S-transferase mu polymorphism and susceptibility to lung cancer in the Portuguese population.	Epidemiological studies have led to the suggestion that a genetic basis may exist in the individual variation in predisposition to cancer. Interindividual differences in human toxicological response to carcinogenic exposure have been attributed to heritable polymorphisms in metabolism, namely glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) coding for enzymes that are known to be detoxifiers of carcinogens. Within the human GST mu class, there is a specific isozyme that is frequently lacking. To check whether or not this association exists in the Portuguese population with lung cancer, we used polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based genotyping to examine GSTM1 polymorphism (nulled and non-nulled) in 84 individuals as a control healthy population and a group of 98 lung cancer patients. In this study we were able to find a frequency of the GSTM1 phenotype among our healthy control subjects consistent with earlier genotyping studies in other Caucasoid populations. For the group of individuals with lung cancer as a whole, or in subsets of histological subtypes, our data for the Portuguese population did not show a positive correlation between the null allele and this neoplasm. In contrast, we found a slight increase in the frequency of the wild-type allele in our lung cancer group.
9950235	Meat consumption, genetic susceptibility, and colon cancer risk: a United States multicenter case-control study.	Meat consumption may especially increase risk of colon cancer when the meat is prepared at high temperatures and consumed by subjects with an inherited susceptibility to well-done meat. In this United States case-control study, the association between meat consumption, genetic susceptibility, and colon cancer risk was studied. Meat consumption data were available from a detailed diet history questionnaire and from questions about methods of preparation. Molecular variants in the carcinogen-metabolizing genes NAT2 and GSTM1 were determined in DNA extracted from WBCs. A total of 1542 cases and 1860 population-based controls were included in these analyses. The amount of red and white meat consumed was not associated with overall colon cancer risk. Processed meat consumption was weakly positively associated with colon cancer risk in men only (odds ratio for highest versus lowest quintile of intake = 1.4, 95% confidence interval = 1.0-1.9). The frequency of fried, broiled, baked, or barbecued meat, use of drippings, and doneness of meat were not significantly associated with risk. The Mutagen Index, as an estimate for exposure to mutagenic or carcinogenic substances, was slightly positively associated with colon cancer risk in men (odds ratio = 1.3, 95% confidence interval = 1.0-1.7). No significant associations with colon cancer risk were observed for different NAT2 and GSTM1 gene variants. The observed associations with processed meat and the Mutagen Index were strongest for those with the intermediate or rapid NAT2 acetylator phenotype. Associations were not markedly influenced by lack of the GSTM1 gene. This study provides little support for an association between meat consumption and colon cancer risk but does provide some, albeit not strong, evidence for a modifying effect of molecular variants of the NAT2 gene.
10870112	Glutathione S-transferase enzyme expression in hematopoietic cell lines implies a differential protective role for T1 and A1 isoenzymes in erythroid and for M1 in lymphoid lineages.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are phase II metabolizing enzymes which catalyze the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) to electrophilic substrates and possess selenium-independent glutathione peroxidase activity. The GST enzyme family includes the cytosolic isoforms GST-alpha, mu (GSTM), pi (GSTP), theta (GSTT) and sigma (GSTS). GSTT1, P1 and M1 are polymorphic and altered polymorphic frequency of genes encoding these proteins has been suggested as a potential risk factor for the development of hematopoietic malignancies. Overexpression of GSTs has also been implicated in chemotherapeutic drug resistance. This study was undertaken to elucidate the potential functional relevance of these genetic polymorphisms in hematopoiesis. DESIGN AND METHODS: GST genotype of 14 hematopoietic cell lines was determined by polymerase- chain-reaction (PCR). Gene expression of GSTs in a cell line was detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on TaqMan 7700 and by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Cytosolic GST protein expression was detected by Western blot. GST conjugation activity was assayed using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) as substrate. RESULTS: GSTP1 expression was higher than other GSTs in 13/14 cell lines and paralleled CDNB conjugation activity. GSTP1 and GSTM1 predominated in lymphoid lines whilst T1 expression was relatively greatest in erythroid lines but was absent in 7/12 non-null lines. GSTT2 was expressed in only 3/4 lines. The 3 cell lines which expressed GSTA1 were all erythroid. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Glutathione S-transerases showed differential lineage expression in hematopoietic cell lines. This implies a greater cytoprotective role for GSTT1 and GSTA1 in erythroid cells and GSTM1 in lymphoid cells. We postulate that inherited gene deletion of GSTT1 and M1 may produce increased genotoxic susceptibility for erythroid and lymphoid cell respectively, following exposure to xenobiotics that are substrates for these enzymes.
11991804	Mu-class glutathione transferase from Xenopus laevis: molecular cloning, expression and site-directed mutagenesis.	A cDNA encoding a Mu-class glutathione transferase (XlGSTM1-1) has been isolated from a Xenopus laevis liver library, and its nucleotide sequence has been determined. XlGSTM1-1 is composed of 219 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 25359 Da. Unlike many mammalian Mu-class GSTs, XlGSTM1-1 has a narrow spectrum of substrate specificity and it is also less effective in conjugating 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. A notable structural feature of XlGSTM1-1 is the presence of the Cys-139 residue in place of the Glu-139, as well as the absence of the Cys-114 residue, present in other Mu-class GSTs, which is replaced by Ala. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicate that Cys-139 is not involved in the catalytic mechanism of XlGSTM1-1 but may be in part responsible for its structural instability, and experiments in vivo confirmed the role of this residue in stability. Evidence indicating that Arg-107 is essential for the 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene conjugation capacity of XlGSTM1-1 is also presented.
12091121	Polymorphisms within glutathione S-transferase genes in pediatric non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are involved in the metabolism of a number of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Certain members within the GST superfamily exhibit phenotypically relevant genetic polymorphisms which have been associated with outcome in hematologic malignant disease. DESIGN AND METHODS: In the present study we genotyped a cohort of 169 pediatric non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients with available specimens from the NHL-BFM trials 86 and 90 conducted by the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) study group to assess a potential association of phenotypically relevant glutathione S-transferase polymorphisms (GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1 codon 105) with treatment outcome in this patient group. RESULTS: Treatment failure in patients with mature B-cell NHL was significantly less likely to occur in patients carrying at least one GSTM1 allele in comparison to those with a homozygous deletion of GSTM1. This protective effect mediated by the presence of GSTM1 was even more pronounced within the subset of therapy group B patients at highest clinical risk of treatment failure (B-ALL, disease stage IV, disease stage III with unresected abdominal tumor, and LDH activity > or = 500 U/L). Of all events in therapy group B, 87.5% occurred in this high risk group. Within this subset, the multivariate relative risk reached 4.98 (95% CI = 1.27-19.52; p= 0.021). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that genetic variation at the GSTM1 locus may be of clinical importance in pediatric NHL and may be a potential candidate for indicating future treatment stratification strategies.
11159743	Polymorphisms at the glutathione S-transferase GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 loci: risk of ovarian cancer by histological subtype.	The phase II glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) GSTT1, GSTM1 and GSTP1 catalyse glutathione-mediated reduction of exogenous and endogenous electrophiles. These GSTs have broad and overlapping substrate specificities and it has been hypothesized that allelic variants associated with less effective detoxification of potential carcinogens may confer an increased susceptibility to cancer. To assess the role of GST gene variants in ovarian cancer development, we screened 285 epithelial ovarian cancer cases and 299 unaffected controls for the GSTT1 deletion (null) variant, the GSTM1 deletion (null) variant and the GSTP1 codon 104 A-->G Ile-->Val amino acid substitution variant. The frequencies of the GSTT1, GSTM1 and GSTP1 polymorphic variants did not vary with tumour behaviour (low malignant potential or invasive) or p53 immunohistochemical status. There was a suggestion that ovarian cancers of the endometrioid or clear cell histological subtype had a higher frequency of the GSTT1 and GSTM1 deletion genotype than other histological subgroups. The GSTT1, GSTM1 and GSTP1 genotype distributions did not differ significantly between unaffected controls and ovarian cancer cases (overall or invasive cancers only). However, the GSTM1 null genotype was associated with increased risk of endometrioid/clear cell invasive cancer [age-adjusted OR (95% CI) = 2.04 (1.01-4.09), P = 0.05], suggesting that deletion of GSTM1 may increase the risk of ovarian cancer of these histological subtypes specifically. This marginally significant finding will require verification by independent studies.
12655560	Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in Turkish breast/ovarian cancer patients.	In this study we genotyped Turkish breast/ovarian cancer patients for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations: protein truncation test (PTT) for exon 11 BRCA1 of and, multiplex PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) for BRCA2, complemented by DNA sequencing. In addition, a modified restriction assay was used for analysis of the predominant Jewish mutations: 185delAG, 5382InsC, Tyr978X (BRCA1) and 6174delT (BRCA2). Eighty three breast/ovarian cancer patients were screened: twenty three had a positive family history of breast/ovarian cancer, ten were males with breast cancer at any age, in eighteen the disease was diagnosed under 40 years of age, one patient had ovarian cancer in addition to breast cancer and one patient had ovarian cancer. All the rest (n=30) were considered sporadic breast cancer cases. Overall, 3 pathogenic mutations (3/53-5.7%) were detected, all in high risk individuals (3/23-13%): a novel (2990insA) and a previously described mutation (R1203X) in BRCA1, and a novel mutation (9255delT) in BRCA2. In addition, three missense mutations [two novel (T42S, N2742S) and a previously published one (S384F)] and two neutral polymorphisms (P9P, P2532P) were detected in BRCA2. Notably none of the male breast cancer patients harbored any mutation, and none of the tested individuals carried any of the Jewish mutations. Our findings suggest that there are no predominant mutations within exon 11 of the BRCA1 and in BRCA2 gene in Turkish high risk families.
7728978	Influence of GSTM1 genotype on sister chromatid exchange induction by styrene-7,8-oxide and 1,2-epoxy-3-butene in cultured human lymphocytes.	Glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1), catalyzing the conjugation of various reactive molecules with glutathione (GSH), shows genetic polymorphism in humans. Almost half of all Caucasians lack the GSTM1 gene, being theoretically at a higher risk from the toxic effects of substrates for GSTM1. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the GSTM1 genotype of lymphocyte donors influences the in vitro induction of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) by styrene-7,8-oxide (SO) and 1,2-epoxy-3-butene (MEB), the epoxide metabolites of styrene and butadiene respectively and potential substrates for GSTM1. SCEs induced after a 48 h treatment (started 24 h after culture initiation) by two different concentrations of SO (50 and 150 microM) and MEB (50 and 250 microM) were analyzed in cultured (72 h) lymphocytes of six GSTM1 null (gene deleted) and six GSTM1-positive (gene present) donors. Both SO and MEB were found to clearly increase SCEs. The GSTM1 genotype had no influence on SCE induction by SO. In contrast, MEB produced a higher level of SCEs among the GSTM1 null than GSTM1-positive samples. At 250 microM MEB, the GSTM1 null donors showed 31% more induced SCEs (on average seven more SCEs per cell) than the GSTM1-positive donors (P = 0.02, acetone treatment as the reference). Furthermore, the GSTM1 null genotype was associated with a slight decrease in mitotic index and replication index, regardless of the treatment. The results suggest that GSTM1-mediated GSH conjugation is an important detoxification pathway for MEB, but not for SO, in cultured human lymphocytes.
8569364	Increased risk for myelodysplastic syndromes in individuals with glutathione transferase theta 1 (GSTT1) gene defect.	"BACKGROUND: The glutathione S-transferases (GST) mediate exposure to various cytotoxic and genotoxic agents, including those associated with increased risk of the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Both GST M1 (GSTM1) and GST theta 1 (GSTT1) genes have a ""null"" variant allele, in which the entire gene is absent. We tested whether the homozygous null genotype of GSTM1 and GSTT1 altered the risk for MDS. METHODS: In a hospital-based case-control study we analysed lymphocyte or bone-marrow DNA samples from 96 patients with MDS and 201 cancer-free controls of similar age, race, and sex. We have restricted our report to the 92 white MDS patients. We analysed GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes by PCR. FINDINGS: The frequency of the GSTT1 null genotype was higher among MDS cases (46%) than among controls (16%). Inheritance of the GSTT1 null genotype conferred a 4.3-fold of MDS (odds ratio 4.3, 95% CI 2.5-7.4, p < 0.00001). The GSTM1 null genotype was not associated with increased risk of MDS (odds ratio 0.8, 0.5-1.3). INTERPRETATION: Individuals with the GSTT1 null genotype may have enhanced susceptibility to MDS. The mechanism might involve decreased detoxification of environmental or endogenous carcinogens."
8589425	Infections with various types of organisms stimulate transcription from a short promoter fragment of the potato gst1 gene.	By histochemical GUS staining, we demonstrate that transcription from a short promoter fragment of the potato gst1 gene is locally induced after infection of a host plant with various types of pathogenic or symbiotic organisms. This regulatory unit is not active in noninfected tissues, except root apices and senescing leaves. Measuring the expression of a fusion between the promoter fragment and the gus gene in transgenic plants, therefore, allows comparison of the induction of defense reactions in different types of plant-microbe interactions, in one and the same plant.
10371349	Molecular mediators of tumor angiogenesis: enhanced expression and activation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor KDR in primary breast cancer.	The progression of breast cancer growth and its ability to metastasize are associated with the process of angiogenesis. In this study, we examined the protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its specific and functional receptor KDR in human breast tissue. We investigated a total of 13 mammary carcinomas, 3 fibroadenomas, 5 specimens with fibrocystic breast disease as well as normal (adjacent to malignant) breast tissue using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. In all carcinomas examined, functional KDR protein was present independent of tumor type, tumor stage and histological grade as demonstrated by tyrosine phosphorylation analysis of KDR. When malignant tissues were compared with their neighboring non-neoplastic regions, activated KDR was found to be expressed to a much higher extent within the malignant tissue samples. In fibroadenomas, KDR was barely detectable, whereas in fibrocystic breast disease KDR expression was variable. Immunostaining of KDR was localized to endothelium and epithelium of mammary ducts in malignant and benign breast tissue, while VEGF immunoreactivity was primarily found in the endothelium and also in tumor cells and macrophages. Our data demonstrate that KDR activation is enhanced in breast cancer in vivo and emphasize the functional role of VEGF and KDR in the development of malignant breast disease.
12150456	GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms and postmenopausal breast cancer risk.	Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of important enzymes involved in the detoxification of a wide variety of known and suspected carcinogens, including potential mammary carcinogens identified in charred meats and tobacco smoke. A substantial proportion of the Caucasian population has a homozygous deletion (null) of the GSTMI or GSTT1 gene, which results in lack of production of these isoenzymes. We conducted a case-control study in a cohort of postmenopausal Iowa women who in 1986 completed a mailed questionnaire on lifestyle factors including information on cigarette smoking and breast cancer risk factors. DNA samples and information related to charred meat intake were obtained, in the case-control study, from breast cancer cases diagnosed during 1992-1994, and a random sample of cancer-free cohort members. Included in this study were 202 cases and 481 controls who were genotyped for GSTM1 or GSTT1 gene polymorphisms. Compared to women who had both GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes, a 60% elevated risk (95% CI = 1.0-2.5) was observed among those whose GSTM1 or GSTT1 gene was deleted. When stratified by meat eating habits, the risk of breast cancer associated with null GSTM1 or GSTT1 genotype was observed primarily among women who ate meats consistently well- or very well-done. Women who carried either one of the null genotypes and consumed meat consistently well- or very well-done had a 3.4-fold elevated risk of developing breast cancer (95% CI = 1.6-7.1). Cigarette smoking was not a risk factor for breast cancer among women who had either the GSTM1 or GSTT1 genes. Among those with the null GSTT1 genotype, however, a significantly elevated risk of breast cancer was associated with cigarette smoking (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1-5.4) and the association was stronger among former (OR = 4.4, 95% CI = 1.5-12.8) than current smokers (OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 0.4-4.1). This study suggests that certain null GST genotypes may be associated with an elevated risk of breast cancer and the association may be modified by charred meat intake and cigarette smoking.
8000297	Inherited glutathione-S-transferase deficiency is a risk factor for pulmonary asbestosis.	"Pulmonary diseases attributable to asbestos exposure constitute a significant public health burden, yet few studies have investigated potential genetic determinants of susceptibility to asbestos-related diseases. The glutathione-S-transferases are a family of conjugating enzymes that both catalyze the detoxification of a variety of potentially cytotoxic electrophilic agents and act in the generation of sulfadipeptide leukotriene inflammatory mediators. The gene encoding glutathione-S-transferase class mu (GSTM-1) is polymorphic; approximately 50% of Caucasian individuals have a homozygous deletion of this gene and do not produce functional enzyme. Glutathione-S-transferase mu (GST-mu) deficiency has been previously reported to be associated with smoking-induced lung cancer. We conducted a cross-sectional study to examine the prevalence of the homozygous deletion for the GSTM-1 gene in members of the carpentry trade occupationally exposed to asbestos. Members of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America attending their 1991 National Union conference were invited to participate. Each participant was offered a chest X-ray and was asked to complete a comprehensive questionnaire and have their blood drawn. All radiographs were assessed for the presence of pneumoconiosis in a blinded fashion by a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-certified International Labor Office ""B"" reader. Individual GSTM-1 status was determined using polymerase chain reaction methods. Six hundred fifty-eight workers were studied. Of these, 80 (12.2%) had X-ray abnormalities associated with asbestos exposure. Individuals genetically deficient in GST-mu were significantly more likely to have radiographic evidence of nonmalignant asbestos-related disease than those who were not deficient (chi 2 = 5.0; P < 0.03).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
8061957	Immunological comparison of cytosolic glutathione S-transferases between rat and two strains of houseflies.	Five different antisera, which include three antisera raised against rat liver glutathione S-transferases (GST), one antiserum raised against human pi GST, and one antiserum raised against housefly GST1, were used to examine their cross-reactivity with different classes of GST subunits isolated from rat liver and the housefly. Two classes of rat liver GSTs, alpha and mu, were isolated from rat liver and two classes of housefly GSTs, GST1 and GST2, were isolated from both CSMA and Cornell-R strains. Antiserum against GST 3-3 was the most reactive antiserum and reacted not only with the mu class of GSTs but also with the GST1 class from both CSMA and Cornell-R strains. Antiserum against human pi GST and antiserum against housefly GST1 had weak immunological reactivity toward the GST1 class from both strains of housefly. Antiserum against GST 4-4 and antiserum against GST 1-1 had no immunological reactivity toward any class of GSTs from housefly. None of the five antisera had any immunological cross-reactivity toward subunit 2 of the alpha class of rat GST and the GST2 class of housefly GSTs from both strains.
9426059	Breast cancer and CYPIA1, GSTM1, and GSTT1 polymorphisms: evidence of a lack of association in Caucasians and African Americans.	Genetically based differences in carcinogen metabolism have been related to polymorphisms of the cytochrome P450IA1 gene (CYPIA1) and the null genotypes of glutathione S-transferase classes mu and theta (GSTM1 and GSTT1). By PCR we examined the genotypes of CYPIA1, GSTM1, and GSTT1 in relation to breast cancer risk in Caucasian and African-American women. The study included 164 Caucasian and 59 African-American women with primary invasive breast cancer and age-matched female controls. Enzyme polymorphisms included in this study were the null deletions of GSTM1 and GSTT1 and the m1 (MspI), m2 (codon 462: isoleucine-->valine), m3 (MspI-AA), and m4 (codon 461: threonine-->asparagine) polymorphisms of CYPIA1. Contrary to previous reports by other investigators, none of the enzyme genotypes, individually or combined, appear to associate with an increased risk for breast cancer in Caucasian or African-American women. We also report that the recently described m4 allele occurs at a lower frequency in African-Americans than Caucasians and is not linked with breast cancer in either race. Thus, it is unlikely that polymorphisms of GSTM1, GSTT1, or CYPIA1 represent susceptibility factors for breast cancer in Caucasians or African-Americans.
9434875	Combined genetic polymorphism and risk for development of lung cancer.	Susceptibility to lung cancer has been shown to be modulated by host specific factors. Inheritance of different polymorphic cytochrome P450s (CYPs) and the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) which affect metabolism of environmental toxicants may play a key role in individual susceptibility. Although individual polymorphic genes have been reported to be associated with development of lung cancer, little is known about the combined effects of several genes in carcinogenesis. From our study of 54 lung cancer patients and 50 matched controls, we observed that a combination of several versions of 'unfavorable' metabolizing genes (CYP2D6, CYP2E1, GSTM1 and GSTT1) is strongly associated with lung cancer. The relative risk for the different combinations of these genotypes ranged between 1.3 and 14, with higher risk involving the activating genes. The duration and intensity of heavy smoking (expressed in pack-years) are the most important determinant for the development of lung cancer. For example, the estimated risk for development of lung cancer associated with smoking > 30 pack-years is represented by an odds ratio = 6.65; 95% CL = 2.3-19.9 irrespective of an individual's genotype, whereas for smoking between > 30 and < 50 pack years, odds ratio = 4.5; 95% CL = 1.37-15; and for smoking > 50 pack-years, odds ratio = 30; 95% CL = 5.7-114. On the other hand, smoking of less than 30 pack-years is associated with an increased risk in the presence of the polymorphic genes (odds ratio = 2.5; 95% CL = 0.32-54). The results of our study indicate that the inheritance of multiple 'unfavorable' genotypes, especially activating genes, is a crucial predisposing factor for the development of lung cancer from cigarette smoking. In addition, the genes may cause moderate smokers who would normally outlive the deleterious effects of smoking to develop lung cancer. The information can therefore be used to target individuals for prevention of health problems.
10580025	Environmental tobacco smoke, genetic susceptibility, and risk of lung cancer in never-smoking women.	BACKGROUND: Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is considered to be a major lung cancer risk factor for never smokers. We investigated the hypothesis that never-smoking women who are exposed to ETS and develop lung cancer are a genetically susceptible population. METHODS: Archival tumor tissues were analyzed from 106 never-smoking women enrolled in a case-control study of ETS (and other personal and environmental factors) and lung cancer risk. We analyzed germline polymorphisms in genes that have been associated with cancer susceptibility and whose products activate (cytochrome P450 1A1 [CYP1A1]) and detoxify (glutathione S-transferases M1 [GSTM1] and T1 [GSTT1]) chemical carcinogens found in tobacco smoke. RESULTS: When compared with never smokers who had no ETS exposure and developed lung cancer (n = 55), never smokers with exposure to ETS who developed lung cancer (n = 51) were more likely to be deficient in GSTM1 activity (i.e., were GSTM1 null) because of a genetic polymorphism in the GSTM1 gene (odds ratio = 2.6; 95% confidence interval = 1.1-6.1). A statistically significant rising trend in risk occurred with increasing ETS exposure (two-sided P =. 02), reaching a more than sixfold excess risk in those exposed to 55 pack-years of ETS (ETS pack-year = ETS produced by an active smoker, within a confined space such as a room, who smokes one pack of cigarettes a day for a year). No evidence was found of associations between GSTT1 deficiency or the CYP1A1 valine variant and lung cancer risk due to ETS exposure. CONCLUSIONS: A common genetic polymorphism divides the population of never smokers into two groups of approximately equal size, one (homozygous carriers of the GSTM1 null allele) that has a statistically significant greater risk of lung cancer from ETS than the other (heterozygous or homozygous carriers of the wild-type GSTM1 allele).
11202185	[Polymorphism of the GSMT1 gene in lung cancer resistance and susceptibility].	"The published studies of onco-associated genetic polymorphisms are characterized by insufficient interlaboratory reproducibility. The inconsistency of the results can be partially attributed to some characteristics of patients and control groups, which are used for the comparison of allele frequencies. For instance, many investigations involve so-called ""healthy donors"" as a standard. However, the efficiency of such a comparison can be questioned; indeed, as an individual life-time risk of malignancy reaches as high as 40-50%, a significant part of ""healthy donors"" would soon or later become the oncological patients. Here we tested the advantage of using ""true"" oncologically tolerant individuals as an additional control, e.g. tumor-free people, who succeeded to achieve an elderly age without signs of any neoplastic disease. GSTM1 gene polymorphism was used as a ""positive control"" for this novel design of molecular epidemiological study, as the GSTM1-null genotype displays slight but reproducible association with lung cancer risk. In the present investigation, GSTM1-deficiency was detected in 45% elderly tumor-free individuals, 55% healthy middle-aged donors, and 59% lung cancer patients. The minimal frequency (43%) of GSTM1(-) genotype was detected in elderly tumor-free smokers, and the maximal one (100%) was found in never-smoking lung cancer patients. Thus, the comparison of lung cancer patients to the ""true"" oncologically tolerant cohort (elderly tumor-free individuals, especially smokers) revealed more demonstrative deviations for the unfavorable genotype, than the traditional comparative analysis between oncological patients and healthy donors."
11328408	Glutathione S-transferase GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes in ovarian cancer: association with p53 expression and survival.	The objective of this study was to determine whether the association between GSTM1 null/GSTTI null and survival in ovarian cancer is mediated by the influence of these genes on p53 expression. In 81 women with pure invasive ovarian cancer, GSTM1 null and GSTT1 null genotypes were identified using polymerase chain reaction and p53 expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry. The association of these factors with survival was examined using Cox's proportional hazards regression models. Performance status (P < 0.001), operative stage (P = 0.004), residual disease (P = 0.001), histologic subtype (P = 0.05), tumor grade (P = 0.007), and the combined GSTMI null/GSTTl null genotype (P = 0.023) were all individually associated with survival. p53 expression was not associated with survival (P = 0.45). In a multivariate analysis, the effects of GSTM1 null/GSTT1 null on survival were lost when residual disease and tumor grade were included. The effects of p53 expression on survival were unchanged when residual disease, tumor grade, operative stage, and performance score were included. GSTM1 null/GSTT1null did not influence the effects of p53 expression on survival and vice versa. The GSTM1 null/GSTT1 null genotype was associated with response to primary chemotherapy (P = 0.007) but p53 expression was not. We conclude that the association of GSTM1 null/GSTTl null with survival appears to be mediated through different mechanisms to p53 expression in ovarian cancer and in addition, may be a better predictor of outcome.
7927352	Human glutathione S-transferase GSTM1 genetic polymorphism in Estonia.	The distribution of glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 (GSTM1) gene deletion was examined in 151 healthy, unrelated individuals from an Estonian population. The study was carried out using the polymerase chain reaction technique. The frequency of individuals with allele GSTM1*0 in homozygous state in Estonian population was 0.503.
10464625	Prevalence of recurring BRCA mutations among Ashkenazi Jewish women with breast cancer.	The BRCA1 mutations 185delAG and 5382insC and the BRCA2 mutation 6174delT have been detected in a significant proportion of Ashkenazi Jewish women with early-onset breast cancer. A group of 236 Jewish women with breast cancer was screened for the presence of these alterations. Mutations were detected in 25.0% (59/236). Among women with breast cancer diagnosed at or before the age of 45, the prevalence of these mutations was 29.1% (42/144). Among women diagnosed with breast cancer after age 45, mutations were noted in 18.5% (17/92). Among women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, the likelihood of detecting a mutation was 32.1% (53/165). BRCA1 185delAG was the most common mutation overall (40/236, 16.9%). The ratio of BRCA1 185delAG to BRCA2 6174delT was 4.0 in women with early-onset breast cancer and 1.3 in women with breast cancer diagnosed after age 45. Clinical features such as age at diagnosis, family history of breast or ovarian cancer, bilateral breast cancer, and personal history of breast and ovarian cancer increase the likelihood of detecting mutations among Ashkenazi women with breast cancer. The yield of testing is low in the absence of any of these features.
10595259	Hereditary susceptibility to breast cancer: significance of age of onset in family history and contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2.	OBJECTIVE: To correlate mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 with family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative for women diagnosed with breast cancer before age 45 who do not have a personal or family history of ovarian cancer. METHODS: Family history for women with breast cancer diagnosed before age 45 was provided by ordering physicians via a test requisition form designed for this purpose. Gene analysis was performed by dye primer sequencing for the entire coding regions of BRCA1 and BRCA2. Because a personal and family history of ovarian cancer are known to be significantly associated with mutations, women with either were excluded from analysis. RESULTS: Overall, deleterious mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 were identified in 85 of 440 women (19%) with breast cancer under 45. Mutations were identified in 73 of 276 women (26%) with a first degree family history of breast cancer compared to 12 of 164 without (7%) (P < .0001). When results were analyzed by the age of diagnosis in first degree relatives, mutations were identified in 56 of 185 women (30%) with at least one first degree relative with breast cancer diagnosed before age 50 compared with 17 of 91 women (19%), where the first degree family history of breast cancer was at or over age 50 (P = .042). CONCLUSION: Among women with breast cancer diagnosed before age 45, a first-degree relative diagnosed with the disease under age 50 is an indicator of a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 even in the absence of a family history of ovarian cancer. Therefore, women diagnosed with early-onset breast cancer should be asked about the age of onset in any first-degree relative diagnosed with the disease, as well as about any family history of ovarian cancer. Mutations in BRCA2 account for a substantial proportion of hereditary breast cancer. Therefore, studies that are limited to BRCA1 or that do not analyze by age of onset of breast cancer in relatives may underestimate the contribution of mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 to women with early onset breast cancer.
10882856	Low penetrance genes associated with increased risk for breast cancer.	Much effort in recent years has been focused on understanding the factors that contribute to breast cancer risk. Two major susceptibility alleles, BRCA1 and BRCA2, have been identified, and the prevalence and penetrance of mutations in these genes have been studied extensively. However, this work highlights the fact that only a small proportion of breast cancer is due to mutations in the genes. Evidence for additional high penetrance genes exists, but it is becoming clear that an understanding of multiple lower penetrance alleles will be necessary to fully define breast cancer risk. Work in this area has focused on the analysis of polymorphisms of potential functional significance in several classes of genes, including those involved in carcinogen metabolism, oestrogen metabolite biosynthesis, steroid hormone receptor activation and DNA damage response. These studies are reviewed and a strategy to use modification of breast cancer penetrance in families with known mutations in BRCA1 as a means of identifying additional low penetrance, or modifier, genes is discussed.
11740339	Glutathione-S-transferase M1, M3, T1 and P1 polymorphisms and susceptibility to non-small-cell lung cancer subtypes and hamartomas.	Polymorphic glutathione-S-transferase (GST) genes causing variations in enzyme activity may influence individual susceptibility to lung cancer. In this case-control study (consisting of 389 Caucasian lung cancer patients, including 151 adenocarcinomas (ACs) and 172 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), and 353 hospital control subjects without malignant disease, genotype frequencies for GSTM1, GSTM3, GSTP1 and GSTT1 were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/ restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-based methods. While adjusted odds ratios (ORs) indicated no significantly increased risk for lung cancer overall due to any single GST genotype, the risk alleles for GSTM1, GSTM3 and GSTP1 conferring reduced enzyme activity were present at higher frequency in SCC than in AC patients. This is consistent with a reduced detoxification of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from cigarette smoke that are more important for the development of SCC than for AC. An explorative data analysis also identified statistically significantly increased ORs for the combinations GSTT1 non-null and GSTP1 GG or AG for lung cancer overall (OR 2.23, CI 1.11-4.45), and for SCC (OR 2.69, CI 1.03-6.99). For lung cancer overall, and especially among SCC patients, the GSTT1 null genotype was underrepresented (SCC 11.2% v. control subjects 19%, P = 0.026, OR 0.57, CI 0.30-1.06). Additionally, in 28 patients with hamartomas, the GSTT1 null genotype was also protective (P = 0.013), while GSTP1 variant allele carriers were overrepresented (OR 2.48, CI 1.06-6.51). In conclusion, GST genotypes may act differently, either by detoxifying harmful tobacco carcinogens and/or by eliminating lung cancer chemopreventive agents. The latter role for GSTT1 would explain the observed lower risk of SCC and hamartoma associated with GSTT1 null. Further confirmatory studies are required.
12014998	Analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in breast and breast/ovarian cancer families shows population substructure in the Iberian peninsula.	An estimated 5-10% of all breast and ovarian cancers are due to an inherited predisposition, representing a rather large number of patients. In Spain 1/13-1/14 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. Two major breast cancer genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, have been identified. To date, several hundred pathogenic mutations in these two genes have been published or reported to the Breast Cancer Information Core, BIC database (http://www.nhgri.nih.gov/Intramural_research_Lab transfer/Bic/index.html). In the present study, 30 Spanish breast and breast/ovarian cancer families (29 from Galicia, NW Spain, and 1 from Catalonia, NE Spain) were screened for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The analysis of these genes was carried out by SSCP for shorter exons and direct sequencing in the case of longer ones. Mutations were found in 8 of the 30 families studied (26.66%). It is important to note that all mutations were detected within the BRCA1 gene: 330 A>G, 910_913delGTTC, 2121 C>T, 3958_3962delCTCAGinsAGGC, and 5530 T>A. The BRCA1 330 A>G mutation was found in four unrelated families and accounted for 50% of all identified mutations.
8841191	Ashkenazi Jewish population frequencies for common mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2.	BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the two major identified causes of inherited breast cancer, with mutations in either gene conferring up to 80-90% lifetime risk of breast cancer in carrier females. Mutations in BRCA1 account for approximately 45% of familial breast cancer and 90% of inherited breast/ovarian cancer, whereas mutations in BRCA2 account for a comparable percentage of inherited breast cancer cases. Over 85 distinct BRCA1 mutations and a growing list of BRCA2 mutations have been identified, with the majority resulting in protein truncation. A specific BRCA1 mutation, 185delAG, has a reported increased carrier frequency of approximately 0.9% in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, but is also found in rare non-Jewish patients with a different haplotype. The 6174delT mutation in BRCA2 was recently identified as a frequent mutation in 8 out of 107 Ashkenazi Jewish women diagnosed with breast cancer by age 50 (ref. 8), as well as in three Ashkenazi male breast cancer patients. We have conducted a large-scale population study to investigate the prevalence of specific BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals who were unselected for breast cancer. BRCA1 mutation screening on approximately 3,000 Ashkenazi Jewish samples determined a carrier frequency of 1.09% for the 185delAG mutation and 0.13% for the 5382insC mutation. BRCA2 analysis on 3,085 individuals from the same population showed a carrier frequency of 1.52% for the 6174delT mutation. This expanded population-based study confirms that the BRCA1 185delAG mutation and the BRCA2 6174delT mutation constitute the two most frequent mutation alleles predisposing to hereditary breast cancer among the Ashkenazim, and suggests a relatively lower penetrance for the 6174delT mutation in BRCA2.
8841192	The carrier frequency of the BRCA2 6174delT mutation among Ashkenazi Jewish individuals is approximately 1%.	Certain germline mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 confer a lifetime risk of developing breast cancer that may approach 90%. The BRCA1 185delAG mutation was found in 20% and the BRCA2 6174delT mutation in 8% of Ashkenazi Jewish women with early-onset breast cancer. The 185delAG mutation was observed in 0.9% of 858 Ashkenazi Jews unselected for a personal or family history of cancer. Assuming comparable age-specific penetrances, a carrier frequency of 0.3% was estimated for the 6174delT BRCA2 mutation. To test this hypothesis, we performed a population survey of 1,255 Jewish individuals. In two independent groups, a prevalence of approximately 1% (C.I. 0.6-1.5) was observed for the 6174delT mutation. The relative risk of developing breast cancer by age 42 was estimated to be 9.3 (C.I. 2.5-22.5) for 6174delT, compared to 31 (C.I. 11-77) for 185delAG. Analysis of 107 Ashkenazi Jewish women with breast cancer and a family history of breast or ovarian cancer confirmed a four-fold greater prevalence for the BRCA1 185delAG mutation compared to the BRCA2 6174delT mutation. Our findings suggest a difference in cumulative life-time penetrance for the two mutations. Genetic counseling for the one in 50 Ashkenazi Jewish individuals harbouring specific germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 must be tailored to reflect the different risks associated with the two mutations.
9029171	Polymorphism of metabolizing genes and lung cancer histology: prevalence of CYP2E1 in adenocarcinoma.	The relationship between genetic predisposition and development of specific cancers has not been adequately elucidated. In this study, the involvement of three polymorphic genes (CYP2E1, GSTM1, and GSTT1) in the development of different histological types of lung cancer was investigated. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes of lung cancer patients who have been long-term cigarette smokers (n = 52). Allelic variants of CYP2E1 were detected using PCR followed by PstI restriction enzyme digest and RFLP analysis, which detects a specific mutation causing over-expression of the gene. GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes were detected using two separate differential PCR methods. Our results indicate a 13.5% allele frequency for the CYP2E1 rare PstI site among the lung cancer patients which represents a 3.4-fold increase over the normal controls (OR = 3.5, 95% CL = 0.65-25.8). A novel observation is that all the patients with this polymorphism had adenocarcinomas only, resulting in a significant association between them (OR = 16.17, 95% CL = 0.95-73, P = 0.02). The frequency of the null GSTM1 gene was 42.3% among the lung cancer patients with no preferential tendency towards developing squamous cell carcinoma versus adenocarcinoma (OR = 1.10, 95% CL = 0.3-4.14, P = 0.5). The GSTT1 gene was absent in 21.1% of the patients with a non-significant tendency towards developing squamous cell carcinoma (OR = 1.23, 95% CL = 0.25-6.1, P = 0.5). Another important observation is the significant predominance of the three predisposing polymorphic alleles among the adenocarcinoma patients (OR = 3.4, 95% CL = 0.78-16.1, P = 0.05) compared with the squamous cell carcinoma patients. The results of this study indicate that the inheritance of several polymorphic metabolizing genes, particularly the CYP2E1 gene, contributes not only to the development of lung cancer but also to the development of specific types of cancer.
9331081	Identification of cellular TSG101 protein in multiple human breast cancer cell lines.	tsg101 was identified as a tumor susceptibility gene by homozygous functional inactivation of allelic loci in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts. The human homologue was mapped at chromosome 11p15.1-2 and found to have intragenic deletion in 7 of 15 breast cancer specimens. To further confirm the relevance of defects in this gene to breast cancer, antibodies specific for the putative gene product were prepared and used to identify cellular TSG101 protein. The antibodies recognized a 46-kDa protein in human retinoblastoma WERI-27 cells labeled with [35S]methionine. This protein was not detected with preimmune sera. In cell fractionation studies, the 46-kDa protein cofractionating with glutathione S-transferase was found mainly in the cytoplasm. Similarly, when cells were immunostained with anti-TSG101 antibodies, fluorescence was localized in the cytoplasm of most of the cells. A full-size 46-kDa TSG101 protein was detected in a panel of 10 breast cancer cell lines and 2 normal breast epithelial cell lines with the same antibodies. Consistently, the full-length TSG101 mRNA was also detected in these breast cells using reverse transcription-PCR. These results indicate that homozygous intragenic deletion of TSG101 is rare in breast cancer cells.
10022251	Polymorphisms in xenobiotic conjugation and disease predisposition.	Low activity of arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 (slow NAT2) was consistently associated with urinary bladder cancer risk. The increased cancer risk attributable to slow NAT2 was more significant when taking gene-environment interactions and gene-gene interactions into account. In urinary bladder, slow NAT2 was no risk factor in subjects who never smoked but became increasingly relevant with increasing lifetime dose of tobacco smoke expressed by an odds ratio of 2.7 for slow NAT2 in extensive smokers. The functional impact of some arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 variants is controversial. It was published that the NAT1 allele 10 was associated with high enzyme activity and that there was an overrepresentation of carriers of NAT1*10 in bladder and colon cancer, but we could only detect a moderately elevated activity of NAT1*10 and an underrepresentation of fast NAT1 alleles in bladder cancer. Recently, a C/A-polymorphism in intron 1 of cytochrome P450 1A2 was associated with high inducibility and persons with this high inducibility variant were overrepresented in bladder cancer, but only if they were smokers or if they had slow NAT2 genotypes. Numerous studies have shown that glutathione S-transferase M1 deficiency (GSTM1*0/0) increases the risk for lung and bladder cancer but the overall risk attributable to GSTM1*0/0 was only around 1.3 according to meta-analyses. The GSTM1*0/0 genotype appears to be the best established metabolic susceptibility factor. Several independent experimental approaches showed that GSTM1 decreases mutagenicity of reactive epoxides and it was shown that carriers of GSTM1*0/0 were at increased risk for several types of cancer and other diseases. There are also studies which showed no effects of GSTM1, a result which is compatible with the assumption that GSTM1*0/0 is a susceptibility factor of moderate strength. GSTM1*0/0 may, however, become a dominant risk factor in certain gene-gene combinations such as the combination with highly active CYP1A1 gene variants or in combination with specific types of exposure. Specific precautions have to be taken in the design of molecular epidemiological studies on risk factors with moderate strength; some requirements for high quality molecular epidemiological studies will be discussed in this article. Molecular epidemiology is an increasingly powerful approach to understand carcinogenesis and may be used in the future to individualize cancer prevention strategies.
12508556	[Research on breast cancer susceptibility genes].	With the increasing of the incidence rate of breast carcinoma year after year, the susceptibility genes of breast carcinoma was paid more and more attention. The study on susceptibility genes play an important role in early diagnosis and prevention for the individuals with family history of breast carcinoma, elucidation of pathologic mechanism of sporadic breast carcinoma, early diagnosis and adjudging prognosis, research on drug sensitivity, differential diagnosis of benign and malignant disease, etc. There were many studies on the high-penetrance susceptibility genes (BRCA1, BRCA2). However, some low-penetrance susceptibility gene, for example, the members of hormone metabolism related enzymes genes CYP family (CYP17, CYP19, CYP1A1, etc.), the carcinogen metabolism related gene (GSTM1, NAT1, NAT2), and DNA damage repair gene (ATM) were not clearly understood. The aim of this study was to review the present research situation of common susceptibility genes of breast carcinoma found already.
14504199	Associations between smoking, passive smoking, GSTM-1, NAT2, and rectal cancer.	Cigarette smoking has been identified as a risk factor for colon cancer, however, much less is known about the association between cigarette smoking and rectal cancer. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the associations between rectal cancer and active and passive cigarette smoking and other forms of tobacco use. We also evaluate how genetic variants of GSTM-1 and NAT2 alter these associations. A population-based case-control study of 952 incident rectal cancer cases and 1205 controls was conducted. Detailed tobacco use information was collected as part of an interviewer-administered questionnaire. DNA was extracted from blood to examine genetic variants of GSTM-1 and NAT2. Cigarette smoking was associated with an increased risk of rectal cancer in men [odds ratio (OR)=1.5, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-2.1 for current smokers; OR=1.7, 95% CI, 1.3-2.3 for smoking >20 pack-years of cigarettes relative to never-smokers]. After adjusting for active smoking, exposure to cigarette smoke of others also was associated with increased risk among men (OR=1.5, 95% CI, 1.1-2.0). Neither GSTM-1 genotype nor NAT2-imputed phenotype was independently associated with rectal cancer. However, the risk associated with smoking cigarettes among those who were GSTM-1 null relative to those who never smoked and had the GSTM-1 present genotype was OR=2.0 (95% CI, 1.2-3.3). This interaction was of borderline significance (P=0.08). Men who had the combined GSTM-1 present genotype and who were rapid acetylators had no increased risk from cigarette smoking. There were no significant associations between cigarette smoking and rectal cancer among women. This study shows that men who smoke cigarettes, especially those who smoke >20 pack-years, are at increased risk of rectal cancer. This association may be influenced by GSTM-1 genotype. Furthermore, exposure to cigarette smoke of others may increase risk of rectal cancer among men who do not smoke.
10625170	Glutathione S-transferase polymorphisms and colorectal cancer: a HuGE review.	The genes glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) (chromosome 1p13.3) and glutathione S-transferase T1 (GSTT1) (22q11.2) code for cytosolic enzymes glutathione S-transferase (GST)-mu and GST-theta, respectively, which are involved in phase 2 metabolism. Both genes may be deleted. There is geographic and ethnic variation in genotype frequencies for both genes. In developed countries, colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer. Colorectal cancer has been inconsistently associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in diet and tobacco. Because GST enzymes are involved in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolism, it has been postulated that genotype may modify colorectal cancer risk associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure. No consistent associations between GSTM1 or GSTT1 genotype and colorectal cancer have been observed. However, most studies have methodological limitations. Few have investigated gene-environment interactions. No interactions between GSTM1 or GSTT1 genotype and smoking and colorectal cancer risk have been reported. One polyp study suggests an interaction between GSTM1 genotype and smoking. Two studies suggest increased disease risk in subjects with high meat intake and GST nonnull genotype, contrary to the underlying hypothesis. One study suggests a strong inverse relation between colorectal adenomas and broccoli consumption, particularly in subjects who are GSTM1 null. These finding require confirmation. Methods for determining GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotype are well established. Population testing is not currently justified.
11773381	Thermostability of reovirus disassembly intermediates (ISVPs) correlates with genetic, biochemical, and thermodynamic properties of major surface protein mu1.	Kinetic analyses of infectivity loss during thermal inactivation of reovirus particles revealed substantial differences between virions and infectious subvirion particles (ISVPs), as well as between the ISVPs of reoviruses type 1 Lang (T1L) and type 3 Dearing (T3D). The difference in thermal inactivation of T1L and T3D ISVPs was attributed to the major surface protein mu1 by genetic analyses with reassortant viruses and recoated cores. Irreversible conformational changes in ISVP-bound mu1 were shown to accompany thermal inactivation. The thermal inactivation of ISVPs approximated first-order kinetics over a range of temperatures, permitting the use of Arrhenius plots to estimate activation enthalpies and entropies that account for the different behaviors of T1L and T3D. An effect similar to enthalpy-entropy compensation was additionally noted for the ISVPs of these two isolates. Kinetic analyses with other ISVP-like particles, including ISVPs of a previously reported thermostable mutant, provided further insights into the role of mu1 as a determinant of thermostability. Intact virions, which contain final sigma3 bound to mu1 as their major surface proteins, exhibited greater thermostability than ISVPs and underwent thermal inactivation with kinetics that deviated from first order, suggesting a role for final sigma3 in both these properties. The distinct inactivation behaviors of ISVPs are consistent with their role as an essential intermediate in reovirus entry.
12399005	Effects of the selective mu(1)-opioid receptor antagonist, naloxonazine, on cocaine-induced conditioned place preference and locomotor behavior in rats.	Administration of the non-selective opioid receptor antagonists, naloxone and naltrexone, attenuate the rewarding effects of cocaine. The relative contributions of specific opioid receptor subtypes that underlie this effect have not been well characterized. Administration of 20.0 mg/kg cocaine resulted in a conditioned place preference. Pretreatment with 20.0 mg/kg but neither 10.0 nor 1.0 mg/kg of the selective mu(1)-opioid receptor antagonist, naloxonazine, blocked cocaine-induced conditioned place preference. On the days in which rats received cocaine only, locomotor behavior was elevated. Pretreatment with the selective mu(1)-opioid receptor antagonist, naloxonazine, regardless of dose, had no effect on cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion. These findings indicate that the rewarding effects of cocaine can be blocked solely by mu(1)-opioid receptor antagonism and are consistent with the view that the locomotor and rewarding effects of drugs can be dissociated.
8627738	Mutations in the zinc-binding motif of the reovirus capsid protein delta 3 eliminate its ability to associate with capsid protein mu 1.	Reovirus capsid protein delta 3 binds both double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and zinc. Previous studies have revealed that the amino-terminal zinc finger is not required for the ability of delta 3 to bind dsRNA. We expressed wild-type and mutant delta 3 molecules by in vitro transcription/translation to evaluate the importance of the zinc finger for other functions of delta 3. delta 3 molecules with mutations in the zinc finger did not form complexes with capsid protein mu 1 but bound dsRNA more efficiently than wild-type delta 3 did. In contrast, a dsRNA-binding mutant was unimpaired in its ability to associate with mu 1. Studies with delta 3 fragments support these findings and indicate that sequences critical for delta 3's interaction with mu 1 lie in the amino terminus of the molecule. Our finding that mu 1 and dsRNA do not compete for identical binding sites on delta 3 has implications for its function as a translational regulator in infected cells.
10359546	Prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations in patients with early-onset breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are found in most families with cases of both breast and ovarian cancer or with many cases of early-onset breast cancer. However, in an outbred population, the prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in patients with breast cancer who were unselected for a family history of this disease has not been determined. METHODS: Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were detected in blood samples from two population-based series of young patients with breast cancer from Britain. RESULTS: Mutations were detected in 15 (5.9%) of 254 women diagnosed with breast cancer before age 36 years (nine [3.5%] in BRCA1 and six [2.4%] in BRCA2) and in 15 (4.1%) of 363 women diagnosed from ages 36 through 45 years (seven [1.9%] in BRCA1 and eight [2.2%] in BRCA2). Eleven percent (six of 55) of patients with a first-degree relative who developed ovarian cancer or breast cancer by age 60 years were mutation carriers, compared with 45% (five of 11) of patients with two or more affected first- or second-degree relatives. The standardized incidence ratio for breast cancer in mothers and sisters was 365 (five observed and 1.37 expected) for 30 mutation carriers and 199 (64 observed and 32.13 expected) for 587 noncarriers. If we assume recent penetrance estimates, the respective proportions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers are 3.1% and 3.0%, respectively, of patients with breast cancer who are younger than age 50 years, 0.49% and 0.84% of patients with breast cancer who are age 50 years or older, and 0.11% and 0.12% of women in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes make approximately equal contributions to early-onset breast cancer in Britain and account for a small proportion of the familial risk of breast cancer.
10472942	Glutathione S-transferase M1 genotypes and the risk of vulvar cancer: a population-based case-control study.	Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) facilitate the excretion of a variety of potential carcinogens. Some 50-60% of Caucasians are homozygous for the null allele of GSTM1, a gene responsible for the presence of one of these enzymes. The authors examined whether women with the GSTM1 null genotype are at altered risk of vulvar cancer. They obtained peripheral blood specimens from 18- to 79-year-old residents of King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties of western Washington who were diagnosed with vulvar cancer between April 1991 and June 1994. Blood specimens were also obtained from controls identified via random digit telephone dialing of western Washington households. The authors determined the GSTM1 genotype of 137 cases (120 in situ and 17 invasive cases) and 248 controls. The frequency of the GSTM1 null genotype was 46.7% among cases and 57.3% among controls. The age-adjusted odds ratio associated with the GSTM1 null genotype was 0.7 (95% confidence interval: 0.4, 1.0). Among current smokers of cigarettes, the age-adjusted odds ratio associated with the GSTM1 null genotype was 0.5 (95% confidence interval: 0.2, 0.9), differing little between heavy and light smokers. Our data suggest that women with the GSTM1 null genotype are not at increased risk of vulvar cancer.
10506113	Glutathione S-transferase-catalyzed conjugation of bioactivated aflatoxin B(1) in human lung: differential cellular distribution and lack of significance of the GSTM1 genetic polymorphism.	Epidemiological studies suggest that aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)), a mycotoxin produced by certain Aspergillus species, may play a role in human respiratory cancers in occupationally-exposed individuals. AFB(1) requires bioactivation to the corresponding exo-8,9-epoxide for carcinogenicity, and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-catalyzed conjugation of the epoxide with glutathione (GSH) is a critical determinant of susceptibility to AFB(1). Of the purified human GST enzymes studied, the polymorphic hGSTM1-1 has the highest activity towards AFB(1) exo-epoxide. The influence of the GSTM1 polymorphism on AFB(1)-GSH formation, as well as the abilities of cytosols from preparations enriched in different isolated lung cell types to conjugate AFB(1)-epoxides, were examined. In whole-lung cytosols from patients undergoing clinically indicated lobectomy, GSTM1 genotype correlated with GSTM1 phenotype as determined by [(3)H]trans-stilbene oxide conjugation: GSTM1-positive = 295 +/- 31 pmol/mg/h (n = 6); GSTM1-negative = 92.8 +/- 23.3 pmol/mg/h (n = 4) (P < 0.05). In contrast, conjugation of microsome-generated [(3)H]AFB(1)-epoxides with GSH was low and variable between patients, and did not correlate with GSTM1 genotype: GSTM1-positive = 11.9 +/- 8.1, 111 +/- 66 and 510 +/- 248 fmol/mg/h (n = 6); GSTM1-negative = 15.3 +/- 16.7, 167 +/- 225 and 540 +/- 618 fmol/mg/h (n = 4) (for 1, 10 and 100 microM [(3)H]AFB(1), respectively). GSH conjugates of AFB(1) exo-epoxide and the much less mutagenic stereoisomer AFB(1) endo-epoxide were produced in a ratio of approximately 1:1 in cytosols from both whole lung and isolated cells. Total cytosolic AFB(1)-epoxide conjugation was significantly higher in fractions enriched in alveolar type II cells (3.07 +/- 1.61 pmol/mg/h) than in unseparated lung cells (0.143 +/- 0.055 pmol/mg/h) or fractions enriched in alveolar macrophages (0. 904 +/- 0.319 pmol/mg/h; n = 4) (P < 0.05). Furthermore, AFB(1)-GSH formation and percentage of alveolar type II cells in different cell fractions were correlated (r = 0.78, P < 0.05). These results demonstrate that human lung GSTs exhibit very low conjugation activity for both AFB(1)-8,9-epoxide stereoisomers, and that this activity is heterogeneously distributed among cell types, with alveolar type II cells exhibiting relatively high activity. Of the GSTs present in human peripheral lung which contribute to AFB(1) exo- and endo-epoxide detoxification, hGSTM1-1 appears to play at most only a minor role.
11188923	[New discoveries in experimental cancer].	"This 7th International Symposium organized by the National Academy of Medicine on New directions in cancer management, was sponsored by IUCC (International Union against Cancer) and received important financial assistance from the Fritz Bender Foundation. In 1996 and 97, the first two Symposia also dealt with cancer, specifically with tumor immunology and with the relation of human breast cancer with MMTV (murine mammary tumor virus). The aim of these introductory remarks is to emphasize recent breakthroughs related to these two subjects, which are also those of my laboratory. Although with inhibitors of angiogenesis it had been possible to block neovascularization without, however, attacking the tumor, recently the addition of low but continuous chemotherapy, so-called ""metronomic therapy"", has led to the reabsorption of established tumors. On the other hand, MMTV homologous viral sequences are being detected in human mammary tumors along with occasional viral particles. Moreover, a correlation has been encountered between the presence of Mus domesticus and a high incidence of human breast cancer in Occident and its absence in Orient where there is a low incidence of this cancer. It is to be hoped that new breakthroughs--or even conclusions from this meeting--will keep adding data towards finding solutions to the difficult problem of cancer."
11424177	Role of glutathione S-transferase mu (GSTM1) in styrene-7,8-oxide toxicity and mutagenicity.	In the human glutathione S-transferase (GST) mu gene family, homozygous deletion of GSTM1 is the null phenotype (frequency of approximately 50% in Caucasians). In the current study, GSTM1 status was determined in human cell lines using reverse transcriptase, polymerase chain reaction, and immunochemistry. Cell lines were challenged with a range of doses of styrene-7,8-oxide (SO) and then toxicity and genotoxicity were monitored. Toxicity was determined by growth in flasks and genotoxicity by cloning in microplates in the presence/absence of 6-thioguanine, to detect mutations at the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) locus. A SO concentration-dependent decrease in survival was observed for all cell lines, with GSTM1-deficient lines being more sensitive. The IC(50)s of deficient and proficient cell lines were 0.45 and 0.55 mM SO, respectively. The difference between survival of GSTM1-deficient and -proficient cell lines approached statistical significance. The background mutation frequency of GSTM1-deficient cell lines was 2 x 10(-5), and that of GSTM1-proficient cell lines was 3 x 10(-6). GSTM1-deficient cell lines were significantly more sensitive than GSTM1-proficient cell lines to mutation induction for concentrations up to 2.5 mM SO (P < 0.001, regression analysis). These results suggest that cell lines containing metabolically competent GSTM1 are able to efficiently use GSTM1 to conjugate SO and reduce its hazard. This supports the epidemiological evidence that GSTM1 influences sensitivity to chemical carcinogenesis and subsequent risk of cancer induction.
8895730	Widespread loss of gelsolin in breast cancers of humans, mice, and rats.	"Down-regulation of gelsolin, an actin-binding protein, is frequently found in several types of transformed cells and tumors. The present study demonstrates that gelsolin protein and RNA were absent or markedly reduced in human breast cancer cell lines relative to ""normal"" mortal human mammary epithelial cells and benign, immortalized cell lines. Moreover, actin filaments were usually attenuated coincident with the reduction in gelsolin. Gelsolin was also missing or greatly decreased in 70% of 30 human sporadic, invasive breast carcinomas examined by immunocytochemistry and in 100% of virally induced mouse and chemically induced rat mammary carcinomas evaluated by Northern analysis. Southern analysis revealed no major mutations in the gelsolin gene of human breast cancer cells. Our results show that partial or total loss of gelsolin expression is common to the majority of breast cancers of diverse etiologies in three animal species and point to gelsolin as a candidate suppressor of breast cancer."
9855008	Associations between both genetic and environmental biomarkers and lung cancer: evidence of a greater risk of lung cancer in women smokers.	This molecular epidemiologic case-control study of lung cancer incorporated three complementary biomarkers: the glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) null genotype, a potential marker of susceptibility, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-DNA adducts (PAH-DNA) and sister chromatid exchanges (SCE), both indicators of environmentally induced genetic damage. Associations between biomarkers and lung cancer were investigated, as were possible gene-environment interactions between the GSTM1 null genotype and tobacco smoke exposure. Subjects included 136 primary non-small cell lung cancer surgical patients and 115 controls at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. Questionnaire and Tumor Registry data, pre-treatment blood samples and biomarker measurements on blood were obtained. Overall, GSTM1 null genotype was significantly associated with lung cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13-3.68]. ORs for GSTM1 and lung cancer were significant in females (2.50, 1.09-5.72) and smokers (2.25, 1.11-4.54) and not significant in males (1.4, 0.58-3.38) and non-smokers (0.88, 0.18-4.33). However, ORs for males versus females and smokers versus non-smokers did not differ significantly. The OR for GSTM1 and lung cancer in female smokers was 3.03 (1.09-8.40), compared with 1.42 (0.53-4.06) in male smokers. In contrast to PAH-DNA adducts in leukocytes, SCE did not differ between cases and controls. Neither biomarker differed significantly between the two GSTM1 genotypes. The combined effect of elevated PAH-DNA adducts and GSTM1 genotype on case-control status (16.19, 1.2-115) appeared multiplicative. Results suggest that the effect of the GSTM1 null genotype is greatest in female smokers, which is consistent with other evidence that indicates that women are at higher risk of lung cancer than males, given equal smoking. Persons with both the GSTM1 deletion and elevated PAH-DNA adducts may represent a sensitive subpopulation with respect to carcinogens in tobacco smoke and other environmental media.
10925368	Interplay between dietary inducers of GST and the GSTM-1 genotype in colon cancer.	The purpose of this study is to determine if cruciferous vegetables and coffee, two dietary inducers of glutatione-S-transferases, interact with GSTM-1 genotype to alter risk of colon cancer. Data were available on 1579 incident cases of adenocarcinoma of the colon and 1898 population-based controls. Intake of cruciferous vegetables, specific types of cruciferous vegetable, and coffee were not associated with colon cancer; GSTM-1 genotype did not modify these associations. However, age at diagnosis and cigarette smoking appeared to be important effect modifiers of the associations between GSTM-1, cruciferous vegetables and colon cancer. Among GSTM-1 null individuals, <55 years at diagnosis, we observed an inverse association between colon cancer and high levels of cruciferous vegetable intake relative to people who did not eat cruciferous vegetables (ORs 0.23 95% CI 0.10-0.54); broccoli was the cruciferous vegetable associated with the strongest inverse association (OR 0.30 95% CI 0.13-0.70). Among younger individuals who were GSTM-1 present (relative to those with GSTM-1 null), we observed an inverse association with colon cancer regardless of level of cruciferous vegetable intake (OR 0.74 95% CI 0.30-1.79 for no intake; OR 0.44 95% CI 0.21-0.92 for <4 servings/week; and OR 0. 44 95% CI 0.19-0.99 for >/=4 servings/week). These associations were further modified by cigarette smoking. People <65 years of age who smoked had a greater reduction in risk of colon cancer from consumption of cruciferous vegetables than non-smokers at the same age. In summary, although cruciferous vegetables do not appear to modify colon cancer risk in the total population, there are subgroups of the population for whom these vegetables may be important. These subgroups are defined mostly by age and smoking status.
12546524	Erythropoietin treatment in metastatic breast cancer--effects on Hb, quality of life and need for transfusion.	Erythropoietin is an effective treatment for anemia in patients with various types of cancers, but few studies have evaluated the benefit of treatment in advanced breast cancer. In this multicenter study, we investigated the influence of two different doses of epoetin-beta on the level of hemoglobin, the need for blood transfusion, quality of life and safety aspects in patients with metastatic breast cancer. A total of 180 patients were randomized to receive either 1000 IE or 5000 IE epoetin-beta subcutaneously three times per week for 24 weeks. An increase of 20 g/L was defined as a positive hemoglobin response. Blood transfusions were given, if clinically indicated. Additional laboratory values and adverse events were recorded. Quality of life was measured with the aid of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Hemoglobin levels increased significantly in both groups. In the high-dose group, the initial mean Hb value was 98 g/L (64-110), which increased to 121 g/L (83-165) by week 24. In the low-dose group, the mean Hb value was 99 g/L (77-110.5) and by week 24 it was 116 g/L (81-144). The majority of patients who responded to treatment did so during the first four weeks. After 4 weeks, 7 patients in the low-dose group and 24 patients in the high-dose group had increased their Hb values by more than 20 g/L. The need for transfusion was low and did not differ between the groups. Quality of life was significantly enhanced in both groups, and there was no difference in the global quality of life between the two study arms. Epoetin-beta is a well-tolerated, safe and effective treatment of anemia in patients with metastatic breast cancer. There were significant improvements in Hb levels and quality of life in both groups.
9298582	Molecular epidemiology of the human glutathione S-transferase genotypes GSTM1 and GSTT1 in cancer susceptibility.	The mu (GSTM1 and theta (GSTT1) members of the glutathione S-transferase multigene family are candidate cancer susceptibility genes because of their ability to regulate the conjugation of carcinogenic compounds to excretable hydrophilic metabolites. Deletion variants that are associated with a lack of enzyme function exist at both these loci. Individuals who are carriers of homozygous deletions in the GSTM1 of GSTT1 genes may have an impaired ability to metabolically eliminate carcinogenic compounds and may therefore be at increased cancer risk. Molecular epidemiological studies have provided three pieces of information about the relationship of GSTM1 and GSTT1 with cancer susceptibility. First, the frequencies of homozygous GSTM1 and GSTT1 deletion carriers is very high (i.e., 20-50%) in most populations studied to date. Second, GSTM1 and, possibly, GSTT1 may be involved in the etiology of cancer at more than one site. Third, the risk conferred to individuals who carry homozygous deletions in GSTM1 and GSTT1 appears to be small in magnitude. (e.g., odds ration of < 2). However, the magnitude of risk is larger (e.g., odds ratio of 3-5) when interactions of GSTM1 of GSTT1 with other factors (e.g., cigarette smoking) are considered. These findings have implications for studies of GSTM1 and GSTT1 in cancer susceptibility and for future applications of these biomarkers in cancer prevention of control strategies. First, molecular epidemiological studies should consider both the common frequency of deletion genotypes and the relatively low cancer risk these deletion genotypes may impart. For example, the common frequency of deletion variants may improve statistical power in some molecular epidemiological studies, but large samples may still be required to detect relatively small effect sizes or important interaction effects. Second, the fact that deletion genotypes are common implies that the proportion of cancer attributable to these variants may be large in the general population. However, these genotypes may be less suited for individual cancer risk assessment because of their relatively small contribution to the absolute risk of cancer.
9355705	Cardiac metastasis from carcinoma breast--a case report.	Secondary neoplasms of the heart are more common than primary tumours. Metastasis occurs most commonly from bronchogenic carcinoma followed by lymphoma and carcinoma breast. Most often cardiac metastasis go undetected as they are asymptomatic and occurs as a terminal event. A 51 year old lady who developed cardiac metastasis from carcinoma breast diagnosed during life is reported with brief review of the literature.
10646903	Breast cancer incidence highest in the range of one species of house mouse, Mus domesticus.	Incidence of human breast cancer (HBC) varies geographically, but to date no environmental factor has explained this variation. Previously, we reported a 44% reduction in the incidence of breast cancer in women fully immunosuppressed following organ transplantation (Stewart et al (1995) Lancet 346: 796-798). In mice infected with the mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV), immunosuppression also reduces the incidence of mammary tumours. DNA with 95% identity to MMTV is detected in 40% of human breast tumours (Wang et al (1995) Cancer Res 55: 5173-5179). These findings led us to ask whether the incidence of HBC could be correlated with the natural ranges of different species of wild mice. We found that the highest incidence of HBC worldwide occurs in lands where Mus domesticus is the resident native or introduced species of house mouse. Given the similar responses of humans and mice to immunosuppression, the near identity between human and mouse MTV DNA sequences, and the close association between HBC incidence and mouse ranges, we propose that humans acquire MMTV from mice. This zoonotic theory for a mouse-viral cause of HBC allows testable predictions and has potential importance in prevention.
11500195	Effect of glutathione S-transferase M1 genotype on progression of atherosclerosis in lifelong male smokers.	We hypothesize that smokers with the null genotype for GSTM1 (GSTM1-0), who thus lack the detoxification enzyme glutathione S-transferase mu-1, develop atherosclerosis at an increased rate compared to smokers with the positive genotype (GSTM1-1). We used data from a 2-year randomized placebo-controlled trial on the effect of vitamin E on atherosclerosis among 189 male smokers. Progression of atherosclerosis was measured by 2-year change of the common carotid intima media thickness (CCA-IMT) as measured by B-mode ultrasonography. The frequency of GSTM1-0 genotype was 0.5 in both the placebo and the vitamin E group. Smokers with GSTM1-0 genotype had a tendency to higher baseline CCA-IMT values than those with GSTM1-1 (0.97 versus 0.92 mm, P=0.09). Within the placebo group, more CCA-IMT progression was found for smokers with the GSTM1-0 than for smokers with the GSTM1-1 genotype after adjustment for baseline IMT and major CVD risk factors (0.050 versus -0.002 mm, P=0.046). In the vitamin E group no effect of GSTM1 genotype on atherosclerosis progression was found. Overall, smokers with GSTM1-0 genotype had a higher mean 2-year progression compared to those with GSTM1-1 as shown by a difference in increase of 0.042 mm (95% CI 0.006; 0.078, P=0.02). In conclusion, our data suggest that smokers lacking the detoxifying enzyme GST mu-1 develop progression of atherosclerosis at an increased rate.
12183407	Genetic and environmental determinants on tissue response to in vitro carcinogen exposure and risk of breast cancer.	To test the hypothesis that individual susceptibility to carcinogen exposure is a risk factor for breast cancer, we measured DNA adduct formation in normal breast tissues treated in vitro with 4 micro M benzo(a)pyrene in 76 cancer cases and 60 noncancer controls. We found a significantly higher level of adducts (134.6 +/- 21.2/10(9)) among cases compared with controls (66.9 +/- 7.5; P = 0.007). The level of adducts was significantly associated with the risk of breast cancer (odds ratio, 4.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 18.50; P = 0.044) after adjusting for confounders. Stratified analysis and regression analysis demonstrated that race, pack-years of smoking, family history of breast cancer, and CYP1B1 genotype were significant predictors of the level of benzo(a)pyrene-induced adducts in the breast tissues. These observations suggest that genetic susceptibility to carcinogen exposure may play an important role in breast carcinogenesis.
9406233	Modulation of antioxidant defenses during apoptosis.	Understanding the fundamental mechanism of apoptosis is crucial to developing therapeutic strategies for controlling apoptosis in diseased tissues. We are using model systems with relevance to cancer treatment to investigate the mechanism of apoptosis. Subtraction hybridization cloning was used to identify transcripts present at higher levels in regressing vs. normal prostate; these may be important for apoptosis. One of the genes cloned from regressing prostate is also upregulated in the murine W7.2 lymphocyte cell line induced to undergo apoptosis by treatment with the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone. This gene encodes a mu class glutathione S-transferase (EC 2.5.1.18), a protein that can protect the cell against oxidative stress by repairing oxidized lipids, proteins, and DNA. Glutathione S-transferase expression does not increase with dexamethasone treatment of lymphocyte cell lines expressing nonfunctional glucocorticoid receptors or a mutation in the apoptotic pathway. Other antioxidant defenses, including catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) and superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1), decline following dexamethasone treatment of W7.2 cells. Overexpression of the bcl-2 oncogene protects these cells against dexamethasone-mediated apoptosis and prevents the decrease in antioxidant enzyme activity. These findings support the hypothesis that control of the cellular redox state is important to the mechanism of glucocorticoid-mediated lymphocyte apoptosis. Another model system we are using is tumor necrosis factor-alpha treatment of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Our preliminary results suggest that, in this system, activation of nuclear factor-kappa B and increased expression of manganese superoxide dismutase may afford protection from apoptosis.
12237897	Survival in prospectively ascertained familial breast cancer: analysis of a series stratified by tumour characteristics, BRCA mutations and oophorectomy.	Dedicated clinics have been established for the early diagnosis and treatment of women at risk for inherited breast cancer, but the effects of such interventions are currently unproven. This second report on prospectively diagnosed inherited breast cancer from the European collaborating centres supports the previous conclusions and adds information on genetic heterogeneity and the effect of oophorectomy. Of 249 patients, 20% had carcinoma in situ (CIS), 54% had infiltrating cancer without spread (CaN0) and 26% had cancer with spread (CaN+). Five-year survival was 100% for CIS, 94% for CaN0 and 72% for CaN+ (p = 0.007). Thirty-six patients had BRCA1 mutations, and 8 had BRCA2 mutations. Presence of BRCA1 mutation was associated with infiltrating cancer, high grade and lack of oestrogen receptor (p < 0.05 for all 3 characteristics). For BRCA1 mutation carriers, 5-year survival was 63% vs. 91% for noncarriers (p = 0.04). For CaN0 patients, mutation carriers had 75% 5-year disease-free survival vs. 96% for noncarriers (p = 0.01). Twenty-one of the mutation carriers had undergone prophylactic oophorectomy, prior to or within 6 months of diagnosis in 13 cases. All but 1 relapse occurred in the 15 who had kept their ovaries, (p < 0.01); no relapse occurred in those who had removed the ovaries within 6 months (p = 0.04) Contralateral cancer was more frequently observed in mutation noncarriers, but this finding did not reach statistical significance. Our findings support the concept that BRCA1 cancer is biologically different from other inherited breast cancers. While current screening protocols appear satisfactory for the majority of women at risk of familial breast cancer, this may not be the case for BRCA1 mutation carriers. The observed effect of oophorectomy was striking.
12406553	Glutathione-S-transferases M1 (GSTM1) and GSTT1 genotype, smoking, consumption of alcohol and tea and risk of esophageal and stomach cancers: a case-control study of a high-incidence area in Jiangsu Province, China.	To evaluate interactions between lifestyle factors and glutathione-S-transferases M1 (GSTM1) and GSTT1 genotypes with reference to development of esophageal and stomach cancers, we conducted a case-control study of 141 cases of esophageal cancer, 153 cases of stomach cancer and 223 population-based controls in Huaian City of Jiangsu Province, China. GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes were identified by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The GSTM1 null genotype was associated with an increased odds ratio for esophageal cancer (2.17, 95% confidence interval=1.35-3.50), but not for stomach cancer. A combined effect was also observed between smoking and the GSTM1 null genotype with regard to esophageal risk. Tea drinking was a protective factor for both cancers, its effect being independent of the GSTT1 and GSTM1 genotypes. These findings suggest the GSTM1 polymorphism is involved in the susceptibility to esophageal cancer development, and tea consumption reduces the risk of esophageal and stomach cancers.
12499585	Enhanced lipid peroxidation in epileptics with null genotype of glutathione S-transferase M1 and intractable seizure.	Null genotype of glutathione S-transferase class me (GSTM1(-)) and the plasma level of malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined in normal subjects, epileptics with good seizure control and epileptics with intractable seizure. The frequency of GSTM1(-) of the epileptics with intractable seizure was significantly higher than that of the group with good seizure control and that of the normal subjects. The average plasma level of MDA of the patients with GSTM1(-) genotype was higher than that of the subjects with GSTM1(+) in either the normal or epileptic group. Thus, the GSTM1(-) genotype may be one of the genetic factors involved in the response to anticonvulsant therapy.
8744297	Modal behavior of the mu 1 Na+ channel and effects of coexpression of the beta 1-subunit.	The adult rat skeletal muscle Na+ channel alpha-subunit (mu 1) appears to gate modally with two kinetic schemes when the channel is expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In the fast mode mu 1 single channels open only once or twice per depolarizing pulse, but in the slow mode the channels demonstrate bursting behavior. Slow-mode gating was favored by hyperpolarized holding potentials and slow depolarizing rates, whereas fast-mode gating was favored by depolarized holding potentials and rapid depolarizations. Single-channel studies showed that coexpression of beta 1 reduces slow-mode gating, so that channels gate almost exclusively in the fast mode. Analysis of open-time histograms showed that mu 1 and mu 1 + beta 1 both have two open-time populations with the same mean open times (MOTs). The difference lies in the relative sizes of the long and short MOT components. When beta 1 was coexpressed with mu 1 in oocytes, the long MOT fraction was greatly reduced. It appears that although mu 1 and mu 1 + beta 1 share the same two open states, the beta 1-subunit favors the mode with the shorter open state. Examination of first latencies showed that it is likely that the rate of activation is increased upon coexpression with beta 1. Experiments also showed that the rate of activation for the fast mode of mu 1 is identical to that for mu 1 + beta 1 and is thus more rapid than the rate of activation for the slow mode. It can be concluded that beta 1 restores native-like kinetics in mu 1 by favoring the fast-gating mode.
9341158	Functional domain mapping of the clathrin-associated adaptor medium chains mu1 and mu2.	The clathrin-associated adaptors AP-1 and AP-2 are heterotetrameric complexes involved in the recognition of sorting signals present within the cytosolic domain of integral membrane proteins. The medium chains of these complexes, mu1 and mu2, have been implicated in two types of interaction: assembly with the beta1 and beta2 chains of the corresponding complexes and recognition of tyrosine-based sorting signals. In this study, we report the results of a structure-function analysis of the mu1 and mu2 chains aimed at identifying regions of the molecules that are responsible for each of the two interactions. Analyses using the yeast two-hybrid system and proteolytic digestion experiments suggest that mu1 and mu2 have a bipartite structure, with the amino-terminal one-third (residues 1-145 of mu1 and mu2) being involved in assembly with the beta chains and the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds (residues 147-423 of mu1 and 164-435 of mu2) binding tyrosine-based sorting signals. These observations support a model in which the amino-terminal one-third of mu2 is embedded within the core of the AP-2 complex, while the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of the protein are exposed to the medium, placing this region in a position to interact with tyrosine-based sorting signals.
10456688	Quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of the glutathione S-transferase GSTM1: in situ phenotyping in archival material.	1. GSTM1 is present in only approximately 50% of Caucasian individuals and deficiency of GSTM1 is associated with susceptibility to a growing number of diseases, especially cancer. Thus, a method that would allow accurate, retrospective determination of the GSTM1 phenotype in different patient populations would have many applications. 2. Developed, therefore, is a quantitative, image-analysis-based immunohistochemical technique for the analysis of GSTM1 protein in paraffin-embedded tissue samples. It was applied to the determination of the GSTM1 phenotype using liver biopsies taken from 70 patients. 3. Of the 70 cases (depending on the cut-off point), 51-54% were deficient in GSTM1. A single 27 kD band characteristic for GSTM1 was found in seven of 16 cases analysed by Western blotting using the same GSTM1 antibody as in the immunohistochemical analysis. There was a good correlation (r = 0.87) between the staining intensity of the GSTM1 band and the staining intensity evaluated by immunohistochemistry. 4. It is concluded that this quantitative immunohistochemical method permits accurate determination of the GSTM1 phenotype and is well suited for retrospective analysis of GSTM1 expression in specific tissues in situ.
7542253	Site-directed mutagenesis of the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid sequence in osteopontin destroys cell adhesion and migration functions.	"Osteopontin (OPN) is a secreted calcium-binding phosphoprotein produced in a variety of normal and pathological contexts, including tissue mineralization and cancer. OPN contains a conserved RGD (arg-gly-asp) amino acid sequence that has been implicated in binding of OPN to cell surface integrins. To determine whether the RGD sequence in OPN is required for adhesive and chemotactic functions, we have introduced two site-directed mutations in the RGD site of the mouse OPN cDNA, in which the RGD sequence was either deleted or mutated to RGE (arg-gly-glu). In order to test the effect of these mutations on OPN function, we expressed control and mutated mouse OPN in E. coli as recombinant glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-OPN fusion proteins. Control mouse GST-OPN was functional in cell adhesion assays, supporting attachment and spreading of mouse (malignant PAP2 ras-transformed NIH 3T3, and, to a lesser extent, normal NIH 3T3 fibroblasts) and human (MDA-MB-435 breast cancer, and normal gingival fibroblast) cells. In contrast, neither of the RGD-mutated OPN proteins (""delRGD"" or ""RGE"") supported adhesion of any of the cell lines, even when used at high concentrations or for long assay times. GRGDS (gly-arg-gly-asp-ser) peptides inhibited cell adhesion to intact GST-OPN, as well as to fibronectin and vitronectin. In chemotaxis assays, GST-OPN promoted directed cell migration of both malignant (PAP2, MDA-MB-435) and normal (gingival fibroblast, and NIH 3T3) cells, while RGD-mutated OPN proteins did not. Together these results suggest that the conserved RGD sequence in OPN is required for the majority of the protein's cell attachment and migration-stimulating functions."
9107426	Arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) and 2 (NAT2) polymorphisms in susceptibility to bladder cancer: the influence of smoking.	Aromatic amines are involved in the etiology of bladder cancer. These compounds are acetylated by N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) and 2 (NAT2), and epidemiological studies have shown that the slow NAT2 acetylator phenotype is associated with increased risk of bladder cancer and may be associated with decreased risk of colorectal cancer. By using PCR-RFLP analyses to identify three known slow acetylator alleles (M1, M2, and M3) and the wild-type, or fast, allele, the NAT2 genotypes were determined. No association between the NAT2 slow acetylator genotype and bladder cancer was found either by crude analyses [odds ratio (OR), 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.91-1.92) or by logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, gender, and smoking exposure (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.92-1.62). A similar observation was made when the cases were divided into incident and surviving cases. Dividing the cases by pathological classification (benign or malignant) did not alter this finding. Likewise, analyses of the NAT1 and glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1) genotypes showed no associations between the NAT1 or GSTM1 genotypes and bladder cancer risk. However, restricting the analysis to people exposed to potential bladder carcinogens (i.e., smokers) among cases and controls, a small but significant association between the slow acetylator genotype and bladder cancer risk was revealed among all cases with malignant tumors (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.02-1.80) and among incident cases with malignant tumors (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.04-2.16). The allele frequencies in the group consisting of smokers showed an overrepresentation of the NAT2 M1 (NAT2*5) allele in the incident case group. The NAT1 and GSTM1 genotypes were not associated with increased risk of bladder cancer among smokers. Analyses of genetic combinations of NAT1/NAT2 as potential risk factors for bladder cancer seem to indicate that the normal NAT1/fast NAT2 genotype may be a protective genotype compared with the other genotype combinations. Analyses of genetic combinations of NAT2/GSTM1 did not reveal any combination of NAT2 and GSTM1 genotypes associated with increased bladder cancer risk.
11588132	Dietary isothiocyanates, glutathione S-transferase -M1, -T1 polymorphisms and lung cancer risk among Chinese women in Singapore.	Chinese populations consume a diet relatively high in isothiocyanates (ITCs), a derivative of cruciferous vegetables known to have cancer-protective effects. This class of compounds is metabolized by the glutathione S-transferase family of enzymes, which are also involved in the detoxification of tobacco-related carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and alkyl halides. We evaluated the association between dietary isothiocyanate intake, GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms, and lung cancer risk in 420 Chinese women: 233 histologically confirmed lung cancer patients and 187 hospital controls. Among these, 58.8% of cases and 90.3% of controls were lifetime nonsmokers. An allele-specific PCR method was used to detect the presence or absence of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes in DNA isolated from peripheral blood. Higher weekly intake of ITCs (above the control median value of 53.0 micromol) reduced the risk of lung cancer to a greater extent in smokers [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 0.31; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.10-0.98] than nonsmokers (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.45-1.11). The inverse association was stronger among subjects with homozygous deletion of GSTM1 and/or GSTT1. Among nonsmokers with GSTM1-null genotype, higher intake of ITCs significantly reduced the risk of lung cancer (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.30-0.95), an effect not seen among those with detectable GSTM1 (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.50-2.29). Our results, in a Chinese female population, are consistent with the hypothesis that ITC is inversely related to the risk of lung cancer, and we show that among nonsmokers this effect may be primarily confined to GST-null individuals. Conjugation and elimination of ITCs is enhanced in GST-non-null relative to -null individuals, such that the GST metabolic genotype modifies the protective effect of ITCs on lung cancer development.
9800384	Glutathione S-transferase M1 and P1 genotypes and urinary excretion of 1-hydroxypyrene in coke oven workers.	The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of the GSTM1 and GSTP1 genotypes on urinary 1-hydroxypyrene, a biomarker for exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. Urine samples were collected from coke oven workers at two time points (from 66 and 46 workers, respectively) and 1-hydroxypyrene was quantitated by HPLC chromatography. The genotype of GSTM1 and GSTP1 was determined by a PCR methods discriminating between GSTM1 present or absent and three different alleles for GSTP1. The mean value of urinary 1-hydroxypyrene was higher at both time points in coke oven workers with GSTM1 gene present compared to workers having the GSTM1 null genotype, but this difference was not statistically significant. The GSTM1 and GSTP1 genotypes were not significant parameters in a multiple regression analysis with urinary 1-hydroxypyrene as the dependent variable and with GSTM1, GSTP1, exposure group and smoking habit as explanatory variables. The biomarker 1-hydroxypyrene is not or only marginally influenced by the GSTM1 genotype. No systematic influence of the GSTP1 genotypes was found.
10953966	Genetic susceptibility to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric cancer. The origin of this disease can be explained by a combination of genetic susceptibility factors and environmental exposures. For the purpose of our study it can be considered as a complex disease, caused by the ""carcinogenic"" effect of the environment modified by a series of genes. In population, these genes tend to occur in allelic forms representing functional polymorphisms thus explaining inter-individual variability in cancer susceptibility. The latter can be evaluated more realistically in childhood ALL than in sporadic cancers of the adult because of its relatively short latency period. We asked therefore, the question about the role of genes controlling the efficiency of xenobiotics metabolism in childhood leukemogenesis. Xenobiotics (drugs and carcinogens) are excreted from the body after metabolic conversion by enzymes mediating oxidation activation (Phase I) and conjugation detoxificaton (Phase II). Functional variants of these enzymes, resulting from known DNA polymorphisms in the corresponding genes, were shown to influence the risk to a variety of solid tumours in adults. A case-control study on ALL patients and healthy controls in a French-Canadian population was carried out by examining the loci of Phase I, CYP1A1 and CYP2D6, as well as Phase II enzymes, GSTM1, GSTT1, NAT1 and NAT2. The NAT2 slow-acetylator, CYP1A1*2A and GSTM1 null genotypes were shown to be significant risk determinants of ALL (OR=1.6, 1.8 and 1.8, respectively), whereas, polymorphisms in CYP2D6 and GSTT1 genes did not seem to play an important role in the aetiology of ALL. Interestingly, the risk associated with NAT2 slow-acetylators was most apparent among males homozygous for NAT1*4 (OR=3.3) whereas girls carrying the CYP1A1*4 allele were significantly underrepresented in the patient group (OR=0.2). These findings point to a gender-specific effect of DNA variants which, at least in part, may explain why ALL is more prevalent among boys. To assess gene-gene interactions, NAT2 slow-acetylators were considered together with GSTM1 null genotypes and CYP1A1*2A alleles. The combined presence of two risk-elevating genotypes appeared to confer an increased risk of ALL among the carriers (OR=2.6). This risk was increased further (OR=3.3) when all three genotypes occurred in the same individuals indicating that the combination of susceptibility variants is more predictive of risk then either of them independently. The association of leukemogenesis in children with metabolising gene variants suggests causal relation to environmental exposures."
8020149	Protection by transfected glutathione S-transferase isozymes against carcinogen-induced alkylation of cellular macromolecules in human MCF-7 cells.	Increased expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) isozymes has been correlated with development of resistance both to cytotoxic anticancer agents and to genotoxic carcinogens. While most anticancer agents are poor GST substrates, the model alkylating carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (NQO) is a good substrate for human pi class GST (hGSTP1-1) and murine GST mu-1 (mGSTM1-1), but not human GST alpha-2 (hGSTA2-2). We investigated whether expression of these GST isozymes in stably transfected clonal cell lines could protect against the genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of NQO. Compared to parental MCF-7 or pSV2neotransfected control cell lines, covalent labeling of total cellular macromolecules by [3H]NQO (0.1-1.0 mM) was reduced by 70% and 92% in hGSTP1-1- and mGSTM1-1-transfected cell lines, respectively, but was not affected in the hGSTA2-2 expressing line. The observed protection was closely correlated with the relative specific activity of each cell line for conjugation of NQO by the transfected GST isozymes and this protection was reversible by pretreatment of cells with the GST inhibitor ethacrynic acid. Similar results were obtained when covalent labeling of total cellular nucleic acid or DNA was measured. However, clonogenic survival assays indicated that the sensitivity of these cell lines to the cytotoxic effects of NQO was similar for the control and GST-transfected MCF-7 cell lines. Thus, while expression of hGSTP1-1 and mGSTM1-1 (but not hGSTA2-2) was highly protective against alkylation of cellular macromolecules by NQO, this protection was not effective against cytotoxicity induced by NQO as measured by clonogenic assay. These results indicate that expression of GST isozymes can protect differentially against the acute genotoxic and potentially mutagenic effects, as compared to the cytotoxic effects, of electrophiles that are detoxified by glutathione conjugation.
8033143	Glutathione S-transferase M1 and its variants A and B as host factors of bladder cancer susceptibility: a case-control study.	Glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) is a foreign compound-metabolizing enzyme with a heritable complete lack of activity in about 50% of Caucasians. GSTM1 deficiency may predispose individuals to urinary bladder cancer. Thus, a hospital-based case-control study was performed with 296 patients with bladder cancer and 400 controls, investigating this GSTM1 deficiency in relation to environmental risk factors and types of bladder cancer. Frequencies of the GSTM1 gene deletion (genotype, GSTM1*0/0) and of the allele variants A (mu) and B (psi) of the GSTM1-active trait were determined using an internal standard-controlled polymerase chain reaction technique. Moreover, in all patients GSTM1 expression was quantified in blood by an immunoassay. Of the cases, 59.1% had the GSTM1*0/0 genotype, in contrast to 50.7% of the controls (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence limits, 1.02-1.92; P = 0.017). The odds ratio after adjustment for age and gender by logistic regression analysis was 1.54 (95% confidence limits, 1.12-2.13). Occupational risk was defined as previous employment in occupations with known increased bladder cancer risk, but the impact of GSTM1*0/0 was not significantly different in individuals with risk jobs versus those without. The greater proportion of the GSTM1-deficient individuals in the group with cancer was due to a lower frequency of carriers of GSTM1A. The odds ratio for the subgroup of individuals with the GSTM1B phenotype versus carriers of the GSTM1A phenotype in cases versus controls was 1.65 (95% confidence limits, 0.976-2.78; two-tailed Fisher's exact P = 0.057). Analysis of functional GSTM1 activity in a subset of 370 blood samples with the model substrate trans-stilbene oxide confirmed the genetic results and showed that 9 of 10 individuals with mu/psi heterodimers (genotype, GSTM1*A/B) had activities above the median of all genetically GSTM1-active individuals (24 pmol/min/1 x 10(6) lymphocytes; P < 0.01), indicating a gene dose relationship for GSTM1. GSTM1 expression in the urinary bladder endothelium detected by immunoassay and immunohistology corresponded to the genotype of the patients. It may be concluded from this study that the heritable GSTM1 deficiency is responsible for 17% (etiological fraction; 95% confidence limits, 2-30%) of bladder cancer cases.
10207629	Glutathione S-transferase-mu (GSTM1) and -theta (GSTT1) genotypes in the etiology of prostate cancer.	The glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are involved in the metabolism of numerous potential prostate carcinogens. Common homozygous germ-line deletions exist in the genes that encode GST-mu (GSTM1) and GST-theta (GSTT1) and preclude enzyme expression. To evaluate whether GSTM1 and/or GSTT1 contribute to prostate cancer (CaP) etiology, we studied 237 incident CaP cases and 239 age- and race-matched controls. The probability of having CaP was increased in men who had nondeleted (functional) genotypes at GSTT1 (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-2.80) but not GSTM1 (odds ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-1.55). No interaction of these genes in CaP etiology was observed. GST-theta is highly expressed in the prostate and can produce genotoxic effects upon exposure to specific carcinogens. These results suggest that GSTT1 is associated with CaP risk.
10792770	A quantitative model using mean and standard deviation for evaluation of interobserver agreement in nuclear atypia scoring of breast carcinomas in a protocol study.	A quantitative model was devised for the purpose of evaluating interobserver agreement in the judgment of the nuclear atypia score of cancer cells in protocol studies. In this model, the mean nuclear atypia score (mu) among observers was considered to approximate the 'true' nuclear atypia score of the tumor, and with an identical mu the strength of interobserver agreement was evaluated by the difference between the ideal standard deviation (sigma) and the observed sigma in the slide conference session. This model was applied to the data of a total of 216 invasive ductal carcinomas acquired at eight slide conference sessions held for the standardization of nuclear atypia scoring and monitoring of interobserver agreement level for enrolled cases in a surgical adjuvant protocol on breast cancer. Compared with conventional percentage interobserver agreement and kappa statistics, the present model, named the lambda model, was more sensitive in detecting the improvement of interobserver agreement in nuclear atypia scoring with repetition of slide conference sessions. The lambda model was particularly effective for evaluating the session which included many intermediate cases with a score between 1 and 2 or between 2 and 3. Percentage interobserver agreement and kappa statistics could estimate the agreement irrespective of the number of observers, but the agreement tended to be underestimated when these intermediate cases were in the majority. The present method was considered to be complementary to conventional methods for evaluating interobserver agreement of cancer histology in protocol studies.
10868696	Indoor coal combustion emissions, GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes, and lung cancer risk: a case-control study in Xuan Wei, China.	The lung cancer mortality rate in Xuan Wei County, China is among the highest in the country and has been associated with exposure to indoor smoky coal emissions that contain high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. This risk may be modified by variation in metabolism genes, including GSTM1, which encodes an enzyme known to detoxify polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. To investigate the relationship between GST genotypes and lung cancer risk in Xuan Wei County, we analyzed GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes in a population-based case-control study. A total of 122 lung cancer patients and 122 controls, individually matched by age, sex, and home fuel type, were studied. Compared to subjects who used less than 130 tons of smoky coal during their lifetime, heavier users (> or =130 tons) had a 2.4-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.3-4.4) increased risk of lung cancer. The GSTM1-null genotype was associated with a 2.3-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.3-4.2) increased risk of lung cancer. Furthermore, there was some evidence that smoky coal use was more strongly associated with lung cancer risk among GSTM1-null versus GSTM1-positive individuals. In contrast, the GSTT1 genotype was not significantly associated with lung cancer risk. Our data suggest that the GSTM1-null genotype may enhance susceptibility to air pollution from indoor coal combustion emissions.
10996421	GSTM1 genotypes in elderly tumour-free smokers and non-smokers.	Cancer is known to be an extremely common disease, with the life-time risks reaching close to 0.5 for men and to 0.4 for women. Hence those individuals, who succeeded to achieve a reasonably old age without a history of malignancy, represent a distinct group of interest, which apparently can be defined as 'tumour-tolerant'. Focus on the genetic features of these subjects may significantly facilitate the research of cancer-predisposing polymorphisms: first, a fundamental understanding of molecular mechanisms conferring the phenomena of cancer resistance appears to be outstandingly important; second, it is promising to involve non-affected geriatric cohorts in the molecular epidemiological studies as a tumour-free control of especial value. Here we analysed the GSTM1 genotype frequencies in the individuals with seemingly different degrees of resistance or susceptibility to neoplasms, such as elderly tumour-free smokers and non-smokers (> or = 75-years-old), healthy middle-aged donors, and lung cancer patients. The proportion of GSTM1-deficient individuals gradually increased from elderly controls (70/157; 45%) to middle-aged ones (77/140; 55%) to lung cancer sufferers (34/58; 59%), showing the minimal estimates in elderly non-affected smokers (35/81; 43%) and the maximal ones in the affected non-smokers (7/7, 100%). These data have led to the two groups of conclusions. First, the broad protective role of GSTM1 has been confirmed in this report. In particular, GSTM1-deficiency appeared to reduce the chances of entering an elderly age without a history of malignancy (OR=0.66 (0.42-1.04); P=0.073). Second, the efficiency of 'tumour patients versus elderly donors' comparative analysis has been exemplified. Indeed, the long-debated fact of overrepresentation of GSTM1(-) genotypes among lung cancer sufferers was clearly demonstrated by comparison of the affected individuals to the geriatric controls (OR=1.76 (0.96-3.23); P=0.068), whereas the same patients failed to produce any convincing deviations towards the middle-aged donors (OR=1.16 (0.63-2.14); P=0.641).
9167459	Pathology of familial breast cancer: differences between breast cancers in carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and sporadic cases. Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium.	BACKGROUND: A few breast cancer cases are attributable to a hereditary predisposition to the disease. We aimed to compare the histological features of breast cancer in women carrying mutations in the susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 with controls unselected for family history. METHODS: The morphological characteristics of specimens from 440 patients with familial breast cancer, including 118 in carriers of BRCA1 mutations and 78 in carriers of BRCA2 mutations, were compared with those from 547 age-matched controls, unselected for family history, by seven pathologists. FINDINGS: Cancers in carriers of BRCA1 (p < 0.0001) and BRCA2 mutations (p = 0.04) were, on average, of a higher overall grade than in controls. For example, the proportions in grade 3 were 66% of 139, 41% of 58 and 36% of 368 specimens, respectively. However, when the three grade indices were considered independently, breast cancers in BRCA1-mutation carriers showed more pleomorphism (p = 0.006), a higher mitotic count (p < 0.0001), and less tubule formation than controls (p = 0.006), whereas cancers in BRCA2-mutation carriers showed less tubule formation (p = 0.003), but no difference in pleomorphism or mitotic count. The occurrence of invasive lobular carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma was not significantly different between carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and controls. Medullary or atypical medullary carcinoma was, however, found more often in BRCA1 (13%, p < 0.0001) than in BRCA2-mutation carriers (3%) or controls (2%). Tubular carcinoma was less common in BRCA2-mutation carriers. The few mucoid carcinomas were all in familial cases. Carriers of BRCA1 mutations showed less ductal carcinoma in situ around the invasive lesion than controls (41 vs 56%, p = 0.001). Lobular carcinoma in situ was less common in familial cancers (p = 0.013), but differences were not significant for BRCA1-mutations or BRCA2-mutation carriers, separately. INTERPRETATION: The histology of breast cancers in predisposed women differs from that in sporadic cases, and there are differences between breast cancers in carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. The findings suggest that breast cancer due to BRCA1, has a different natural history to BRCA2 or apparently sporadic disease, which may have implications for screening and management.
9882431	Distinctive structure of the human GSTM3 gene-inverted orientation relative to the mu class glutathione transferase gene cluster.	"The sequence and exon-intron structure of the human class mu GSTM3 glutathione transferase gene and its orientation with respect to the remainder of the human class mu GSTM gene cluster were determined. The GSTM3 gene is 2847 bp long and is thus considerably shorter than the other class mu genes in the cluster, which range in size from 5325 to 7212 bp. Outside the protein-coding region, the GSTM3 gene does not share significant sequence similarity with other class mu glutathione transferase genes. Identification of overlapping cosmid clones that span the region between GSTM5, the next nearest glutathione transferase gene, and GSTM3 showed that the two genes are about 20,000 bp apart. PCR primers developed from sequences 3'-downstream from the GSTM5 gene were used to identify clones containing the GSTM3 gene. Amplification with these primers showed that the orientation of the GSTM3 gene is 5'-GSTM5-3'-3'-GSTM3-5'. Long-range PCR reactions confirmed this orientation both in the GSTM-YAC2 YAC clone, which contains the five class mu glutathione transferase genes on chromosome 1, and in human DNA. This tail-to-tail orientation is consistent with an evolutionary model of class mu glutathione transferase divergence from a pair of tail-to-tail ""M1-like"" and ""M3-like"" class mu glutathione transferase genes that was present at the mammalian radiation to the current organization of multiple head-to-tail M1-like genes tail-to-tail with a single M3-like gene with distinct structural properties and expression patterns."
10445390	Polymorphism of GSTM1 gene in patients with colorectal cancer and colonic polyps.	The frequency of the GSTM1 gene in patients with nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (CRC) (n = 70) and in subjects with colonic polyps (n = 27) was evaluated and compared with healthy individuals (n = 145). Patients with CRC were divided into the three groups: patients coming from the families with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) (n = 17); patients with a high risk of HNPCC who were referred to as suspected of HNPCC (n = 25); patients with sporadic colorectal cancer without clinical features of hereditary tumours (n = 28). A simple polymerase chain reaction (PCR) - based assay to identify GSTM1 nulled and positive (non-nulled) genotype was used. No significant differences in frequency of nulled individuals were observed in both patients with HNPCC and patients suspected of HNPCC as well as in subjects with colonic polyps. The most interesting observation was made in the group of patients with sporadic CRC. Twenty individuals (71.4 %) of the group were GSTM 1 deficient which was significantly different from the control population (p < 0.04). The above data indicate that the absence of the GSTM1 gene is associated with a greater risk of sporadic colorectal cancer. There is an increase in the overall risk of approximately 2.5 as compared with the control population.
12064742	Antigen levels of urokinase type plasminogen activator and its inhibitors in primary breast cancer.	Primary Breast Cancer, Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator, Inhibitors The aim of the study was to monitor urokinase plasminogen activator antigen concentrations and its type 1 (PAI-1) and type 2 (PAI-2) inhibitors in histologically defined forms of primary breast cancer and a comparison with these antigens levels in normal tissue. Another goal was a search for a relationship/or its lack/between the occurrence of the new generation markers of neoplastic disease and a presence/or absence/of lymph node metastases. U-PA, PAI-1 and PAI-2 antigen levels were determined by ELISA tests in protein extracts of breast cancer tissues. Among the studied breast tumors 32 specimens were ductal carcinomas, 15 specimens were lobular carcinomas and the remaining 13 were other rare histological forms. In comparison to the obtained values of u-PA antigen levels in normal tissue, the values in neoplastic tissues were elevated several times: 11-fold, 6-fold and 15-fold in ductal c., lobular c. and other rare neoplasms. The values of PAI-1 antigen levels were about 20-fold higher for all studied, histologically defined primary breast cancers. The greatest differences of PAI-2 antigen levels growth was observed in histologically defined primary breast cancer forms. It was augmented 10-fold, 40-fold and 20-fold, respectively, for ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma and rare forms of neoplasms. In various forms of invasive breast cancer and those without lymph node metastases the content of u-PA, PAI-1 and PAI-2 were also significantly elevated. Among the new generation of independent markers of the neoplastic process, PAI-2 seems to be the most reliable marker for the identification of primary breast cancer. The goal of the present study was to evaluate a possible combined prognostic value of the three major components of the u-PA system (u-PA, PAI-1 and PAI-2) in patients with defined histopathological forms of primary breast cancer.
12203997	Analysis of breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 in Thai familial and isolated early-onset breast and ovarian cancer.	Here we report the study on BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in 12 Thai breast and/or ovarian cancer families and 6 early-onset breast or breast/ovarian cancer cases without a family history of cancer. Five distinct rare alterations were identified in each gene: four introducing premature stop codons, one in-frame deletion, two missense changes, two intronic alterations and one silent rare variant. The BRCA1 or BRCA2 truncating mutations were detected in four of seven patients with familial or personal history of breast and ovarian cancer, in one of four isolated early onset breast cancer cases and in none of seven breast cancer site specific families. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation yield in Thai patients is consistent with that reported from Europe and North America in similar groups of patients, being particularly high in individuals with personal or family history of breast and ovarian cancer. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 alterations found in this series are different from those identified in other Asian studies, and all but two have never been reported before. We report at least three novel deleterious mutations, the BRCA1 3300delA, BRCA1 744ins20 and BRCA2 6382delT. One in-frame deletion was also found, the BRCA2 5527del9, which seggregated within family members of breast-only cancer patients and was thought to be a cancer-related mutation. BRCA1 3300delA and Asp67Glu alterations were detected each in at least two families and thus could represent founder mutations in Thais.
12949934	Positive correlation between single or combined genotypes of CYP1A1 and GSTM1 in relation to prostate cancer in Chilean people.	BACKGROUND: The prostate cancer is a slowly progressing disease that begins decades prior to diagnosis. It has been suggested that there might be differences in susceptibility due to genetic polymorphisms in biotransformation enzyme genes. In the present work, associations between CYP1A1(Msp1), GSTM1(-/-) polymorphisms, and prostate cancer were analyzed in a case-control study. METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples, collected on EDTA. PCR-RFLP was used to determine simultaneously Msp1 and GSTM1(-/-) polymorphisms. RESULTS: In cancer patients, frequency of m2 variant allele (0.377) and GSTM1(-/-) (0.362) showed statistically significant increases compared to the control group (0.262 and 0.227, respectively). The estimate relative risks (OR) were higher for individuals carrying combined CYP1A1 and GSTM1 rare genotypes, in relation to individuals carrying CYP1A1 or GSTM1 alone. Multivariate logistic regression analysis including confounding factors (age, digital examination, and PSA antigen) showed even higher risk for individuals carrying m2m2 genotype (OR = 3.99; 95% CI, 1.27-12.54), GST(-/-) genotype (OR = 2.75; 95% CI, 1.31-5.79), and m2m2/GST(-) genotype (OR = 16.63; 95% CI, 1.67-165.48). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings suggest that Chilean people carrying single or combined GSTM1 and CYP1A1 polymorphisms are more susceptible to prostate cancer.
7614465	Pulmonary expression of glutathione S-transferase M3 in lung cancer patients: association with GSTM1 polymorphism, smoking, and asbestos exposure.	To characterize the relative roles of glutathione S-transferases (GST) M1 and M3 in the susceptibility to lung cancer, the pulmonary expression of GSTM3 was quantified immunochemically and related to the GSTM1 genotype in 100 lung cancer patients. Among active smokers and recent ex-smokers (for 6 years or less), parenchymal GSTM3 expression was lower in patients with a homozygous GSTM1 null genotype than in those who were GSTM1 positive and had similar smoking habits (P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively). However, in long-term ex-smokers (for 15 years or longer) GSTM3 was not affected by the GSTM1 genotype. Among active smokers and recent ex-smokers who were homozygous GSTM1 null, those with a definite or probable exposure to asbestos expressed GSTM3 at significantly higher levels than those for whom it was unlikely (P = 0.04). A similar effect of the homozygous GSTM1 null genotype on GSTM3 expression was not detected in the bronchial epithelium when GSTM3 was visualized immunohistochemically. Different mechanisms may result in an increased risk of either squamous cell or adenocarcinomas in patients with the homozygous GSTM1 null genotype. Low expression of GSTM3 due to smoking in the parenchymal lung of GSTM1 null individuals can theoretically favor the development of adenocarcinoma. Our data indicated a predominance of this tumor type in patients with low expression of GSTM3.
7666488	Human leukocyte glutathione S-transferase isozyme (class mu) and susceptibility to smoking-related cancers.	Glutathione S-transferase isozyme class mu from human leukocytes has been shown to be dominantly inherited and can be determined by activity measurement directed toward the substrate trans-stilbene oxide. The activity distribution of leukocyte glutathione S-transferase class mu was determined from control healthy nonsmokers, smokers, and smoking-related cancer patients. In a control healthy nonsmoker population, 54% (n = 50) of the subjects showed high levels of glutathione S-transferase class mu activity. In patients with cancers known to be related to smoking, 46% (n = 50) showed higher levels of glutathione S-transferase class mu. Noncancer smokers matched for age and smoking history with cancer patients showed an increased likelihood of having glutathione S-transferase (GST) class mu activity (76%). These results suggest that GST mu may be a cancer susceptibility marker in the case of smokers. In rats, benzo[a]pyrene (1 mg/kg, ip) administration daily for 3 d produced a significant increase in liver glutathione S-transferase class mu. Although these induction studies in experimental animals may not be relevant to humans, there is a possibility that, as in rats, this enzyme may be inducible in humans by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
8200649	Immunolocalization of aromatase and other steroidogenic enzymes in human breast disorders.	Numerous studies have shown that human breast cancer tissue has the potential to synthesize estrogen through aromatization, which may act as a local growth factor of hormone-dependent cancer cells. This study was performed to localize the site of aromatization in human breast disorders by immunohistochemistry and correlate the findings with steroid receptors, clinicopathological findings, and other steroidogenic enzymes. Specimens from 60 cases of breast disorders, including 33 cases of breast cancer and 27 cases of benign proliferative disorders, were studied immunohistochemically for aromatase. In the carcinoma cases estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) status was determined by enzyme immunoassay and immunohistochemistry, and other steroidogenic enzymes, including P450scc (side-chain cleavage), 3 beta HSD (hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase), and P450c17, were immunolocalized. Aromatase was immunolocalized in interstitial cells and adipocytes as well as other cells in both benign and malignant breast tissues. However, strong immunoreactivity was observed in adipocytes adjacent to carcinoma in all carcinoma cases and in interstitial or stromal cells around carcinomatous glands in 20 carcinoma cases. Intratumoral staining for aromatase did not correlate significantly with age, clinical stage, histopathological type, lymph nodes metastasis, or ER and PgR status. P450scc and 3 beta HSD were focally observed in 18 and 12 cases of carcinoma, respectively, but P450c17 was never observed. Aromatase expression in stromal or interstitial cells, including adipocytes, in breast cancer may be induced by carcinoma cells and locally synthesized estrogens could function as paracrine hormones. Intratumoral aromatase in human breast neoplasms correlated with malignant phenotypes but not with ER status or prognostic parameters, suggesting that other synthetic systems probably generate any biologically significant locally synthesized estrogens in hormone-dependent breast malignancy.
11320670	Primary breast tumor levels of suspected molecular determinants of cellular sensitivity to cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and certain other anticancer agents as predictors of paired metastatic tumor levels of these determinants. Rational individualization of cancer chemotherapeutic regimens.	"PURPOSE: Cyclophosphamide is one of the most frequently used agents in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and high-dose chemotherapeutic treatment of breast cancers. Preclinical models indicate that cellular sensitivity to cyclophosphamide and other oxazaphosphorines, e.g., ifosfamide, is inversely related to the cellular content of two aldehyde dehydrogenases, viz ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1, and glutathione. Breast tumor levels of these ""determinants of cellular sensitivity to the oxazaphosphorines"" are known to vary widely, and the decision as to whether or not to use an oxazaphosphorine as part of the therapeutic strategy to treat breast cancer in any given patient is likely to depend, in large part, on the levels of these determinants in that cancer. ALDH1A1, ALDH3A1, and glutathione levels can be easily quantified in primary breast tumors and in detectable metastatic breast tumors present in axillary lymph nodes because the amounts of tissue required for the desired analysis can be readily obtained, whereas these levels cannot be quantified in residual metastatic breast cancer cell populations, i.e., those that escape detection and/or that are inaccessible to surgical harvest. The inability to directly quantify residual metastatic breast cancer cell ALDH1A1, ALDH3A1, and glutathione levels would not preclude a rational decision with regard to the inclusion/exclusion of an oxazaphosphorine as part of the chemotherapeutic strategy intended to eradicate residual metastatic breast cancer cells if primary breast tumor levels of these determinants reliably predicted those in metastatic breast cancer cells. METHODS: ELISAs and spectrophotometric assays were used to quantify enzyme and glutathione levels in paired human primary and locally advanced metastatic breast tumor samples. RESULTS: Primary breast tumor ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1 levels were highly predictive of their respective levels in paired metastatic breast tumors present in axillary lymph nodes (r2 = 0.80 and 0.85, respectively). On the other hand, those of glutathione were relatively poorly predictive of its levels in paired metastatic offshoots (r2 = 0.35). Primary breast tumor levels of some additional enzymes known to catalyze the detoxification/toxification of various anticancer agents, though not of cyclophosphamide, were poorly predictive (DT-diaphorase and glutathione S-transferases alpha, mu, and pi) or not predictive (cytochrome P450 1A1) of their respective levels in paired metastatic offshoots. CONCLUSION: Since ALDH1A1, ALDH3A1 and, to a lesser extent, glutathione levels in primary breast tumors reliably predicted those in detectable and easily accessible metastatic breast cancer cell populations, viz those in axillary lymph nodes, they are also likely to be predictive of these levels in undetectable and/or relatively inaccessible metastatic breast cancer cell populations. Thus, quantification of primary breast tumor ALDH1A1, ALDH3A1 and, to a lesser extent, glutathione levels prior to the initiation of not only neoadjuvant but also adjuvant and high-dose breast cancer chemotherapy is likely to be of value in the rational design of individualized chemotherapeutic regimens intended to eradicate breast cancer cells with a minimum of untoward effects."
10566550	Effect of vitamin intervention on the relationship between GSTM1, smoking, and lung cancer risk among male smokers.	The GSTM1 (glutathione S-transferase mu-1) null genotype is suspected of increasing an individual's susceptibility to tobacco smoke carcinogens because of impaired carcinogen detoxification. We were interested in whether there were differences in lung cancer susceptibility to smoking within the GSTM1 genotypes and the impact of antioxidant supplementation on this. For this purpose, we conducted a nested lung cancer case-control study and evaluated the role of GSTM1 within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study. GSTM1 genotype status was determined for 319 cases and 333 controls using a PCR-based approach. GSTM1 was evaluated as an independent risk factor and as an effect modifier of smoking using logistic regression analyses. The GSTM1 null genotype itself was unrelated to risk of lung cancer, odds ratio (OR) = 1.09 and 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.79-1.50, but it may have modified the effect of smoking. There was a suggestion for a stronger association between years of smoking and lung cancer among the GSTM1 null genotype, but the differences between GSTM1 null and present genotypes were not statistically significant (P = 0.12). Furthermore, the smoking association was strongest among those with the GSTM1 null genotype not receiving alpha-tocopherol supplementation, whereas among those receiving alpha-tocopherol, there was no modification by GSTM1 on the association between smoking duration and lung cancer risk. Beta-carotene supplementation did not modify the relationship between GSTM1, smoking years, and lung cancer risk. In conclusion, GSTM1 is not associated with lung cancer risk in male smokers but may confer a higher susceptibility to cumulative tobacco exposure. This association may be attenuated by alpha-tocopherol but not by beta-carotene supplementation.
11443730	Evidence for further breast cancer susceptibility genes in addition to BRCA1 and BRCA2 in a population-based study.	We used data from a population based series of breast cancer patients to investigate the genetic models that can best explain familial breast cancer not due to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The data set consisted of 1,484 women diagnosed with breast cancer under age 55 registered in the East Anglia Cancer registry between 1991-1996. Blood samples taken from the patients were analysed for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. The genetic models were constructed using information on breast and ovarian cancer history in first-degree relatives and on the mutation status of the index patients. We estimated the simultaneous effects of BRCA1, BRCA2, a third hypothetical gene BRCA3, and a polygenic effect. The models were assessed by likelihood comparisons and by comparison of the observed numbers of mutations and affected relatives with the predicted numbers. BRCA1 and BRCA2 could not explain all the familial clustering of breast cancer. The best-fitting single gene model for BRCA3 was a recessive model with a disease allele frequency 24% and penetrance 42% by age 70. However, a polygenic model gave a similarly good fit. The estimated population frequencies for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were similar under both recessive and polygenic models, 0.024 and 0.041%, respectively. A dominant model for BRCA3 gave a somewhat worse fit, although the difference was not significant. The mixed recessive model was identical to the recessive model and the mixed dominant very similar to the polygenic model. The BRCA3 genetic models were robust to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 penetrance assumptions. The overall fit of all models was improved when the known effects of parity on breast and ovarian cancer risks were included in the model-in this case a polygenic model fits best. These findings suggest that a number of common, low-penetrance genes with additive effects may account for the residual non-BRCA1/2 familial aggregation of breast cancer, but Mendelian inheritance of an autosomal recessive allele cannot be ruled out.
12117698	Pooled analysis and meta-analysis of glutathione S-transferase M1 and bladder cancer: a HuGE review.	Smoking is a known risk factor for bladder cancer. The product of the GSTM1 gene, glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1), is involved in the detoxification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in tobacco smoke; a homozygous deletion of this gene in approximately 50% of Caucasians and Asians results in a lack of GSTM1 enzyme activity. Most studies examining the relation between bladder cancer and GSTM1 have reported an increased risk associated with a lack of GSTM1 activity. The authors performed meta- and pooled analyses of published and unpublished, case-control, genotype-based studies that examined this association (17 studies, 2,149 cases, 3,646 controls) and excluded studies conducted in populations with a high prevalence of exposure to known bladder cancer risk factors other than tobacco smoke. Using random effects models in the meta-analysis, the authors obtained a summary odds ratio of 1.44 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.23, 1.68) for GSTM1 null status with all studies included. Results from studies with at least 100 cases and 100 controls produced a summary odds ratio of 1.42 (95% CI: 1.26, 1.60). Pooled analyses using original data sets from 10 studies (1,496 cases and 1,444 controls) and adjusting for age, sex, and race produced similar results. There was no evidence of multiplicative interaction between the GSTM1 null genotype and ever smoking in relation to bladder cancer, although there was a suggestion of additive interaction (additive interaction = 0.45, 95% CI: -0.03, 0.93). These results indicate that, among populations studied to date, GSTM1 null status is associated with a modest increase in the risk of bladder cancer.
11227922	Peanut butter intake, GSTM1 genotype and hepatocellular carcinoma: a case-control study in Sudan.	OBJECTIVE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the major cancers in the world. In Sudan the incidence is thought to be high and increasing. This study aims to assess the association between peanut butter intake, as a source of aflatoxins, and the GSTM1 genotype in the etiology of HCC. METHOD: A case control study was conducted among 150 patients and 205 controls from two regions in Sudan. Food habits with special reference to peanut butter consumption, as well as peanut storage systems, have been investigated, as well as confounders such as hepatitis, drinking and smoking habits, and demographic characteristics. GSTM1 genotype was assessed in DNA extracted from blood samples (110 cases, 189 controls). RESULTS: A positive association was observed for highest vs. lowest quartile of peanut butter intake, humid storage system and HCC, with ORs (95% CI) being 3.0 (1.6-5.5) and 1.6 (1.1-2.5) respectively. The positive association with peanut butter intake was essentially limited to subjects with GSTM1 null genotype with OR for highest vs. lowest quartile 16.7 (2.7-105). CONCLUSION: Peanut butter consumption has been identified as a strong risk factor of HCC in a region with endemic aflatoxin contamination in Sudan and was essentially limited to subjects with the GSTM1 null genotype.
11320155	Trans-stilbene oxide-induced sister chromatid exchange in cultured human lymphocytes: influence of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes.	About 50% and 15% of Caucasians lack the glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) and T1 (GSTT1) genes and the corresponding enzyme activity, respectively. Both of these polymorphisms have been shown to affect the genotoxicity of some epoxides in cultured human lymphocytes. Especially GSTT1 appears to be important in whole-blood cultures, probably because GSTT1 activity is high in erythrocytes. The in vitro genotoxicity of trans-stilbene oxide (TSO), a model substrate for GSTM1, has been shown to depend on individual GSTM1 activity. The potential role of GSTM1 genotype, and the possible interference of GSTT1 genotype, has not previously been examined in this context. We have studied TSO-induced sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in 72 h whole-blood lymphocyte cultures from 24 healthy human donors, representing different combinations of GSTM1 and GSTT1 positive and null genotypes. TSO clearly increased SCEs in cultures of all donors. The mean number of SCEs per cell induced by 75 and 150 microM TSO was, respectively, 1.5- and 1.3-times higher in cultures of GSTM1 null than GSTM1 positive donors. In another experiment, GSTM1 null individuals showed, in comparison with GSTM1 positive subjects, a 1.8-fold SCE induction by 50 microM TSO. GSTT1 genotype did not have an unequivocal effect. Our findings suggest that the lack of the GSTM1 gene, resulting in reduced detoxification capacity, increases individual sensitivity to the genotoxic effects of TSO.
11535249	Impact of metabolic genotypes on levels of biomarkers of genotoxic exposure.	Phase I and Phase II xenobiotic-metabolising enzyme families are involved in the metabolic activation and detoxification of various classes of environmental carcinogens. Particular genetic polymorphisms of these enzymes have been shown to influence individual cancer risk. A brief overview is presented about recent research of the relationship between metabolic genotypes and internal dose, biologically effective dose and cytogenetic effects of complex and specific genotoxic exposures of human study populations, and we report our new results from two molecular epidemiological studies. We investigated the effects of multiple interactions among CYP1A1 Ile462Val, CYP1A1 MspI, CYP1B1 Leu432Val, CYP2C9 Arg144Cys, CYP2C9 Ile359Leu, NQO1 Pro189Ser, GSTM1 gene deletion and GSTP1 Ile105Val genotypes on the levels of carcinogen-DNA adducts determined by (32)P-postlabelling and PAH-DNA immunoassay in peripheral blood lymphocytes from workers occupationally exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in aluminium plants, and in bronchial tissue from smoking lung patients. A statistically significant positive linear correlation was observed between white blood cell aromatic DNA adduct and urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHPY) levels from potroom workers with GSTM1 null genotype (P=0.011). Our results suggest interactions between GSTM1 and GSTP1 alleles in modulation of urinary 1-OHPY levels and white blood cell DNA adduct levels in the PAH-exposed workers. Interactions between GSTM1 and GSTP1 alleles, in association with particular genotype combinations of CYPs, were also recognised in bronchial aromatic DNA adduct levels of smoking lung patients. The impact of single metabolic genotypes and their combinations on biomarkers of exposure was usually weak, if any, in both our studies and reports of the literature. The effect of special metabolic gene interactions may be better recognised if the compared groups of individuals are stratified for multiple potential modulators of the observable biomarker end-point, and/or if chemical structure-specific biomarker methods are applied.
12175564	Individualization of radiotherapy in breast cancer patients: possible usefulness of a DNA damage assay to measure normal cell radiosensitivity.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the distribution of sensitivities in breast cancer patients, measured using a DNA damage assay on lymphocytes, is likely to provide sufficient discrimination to enable the reliable identification of patients with abnormal sensitivities. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Radiosensitivity (x) was assessed in 226 samples of lymphocytes from unselected women with breast cancer and was quantified as the initial number of DNA double-strand breaks (dsb) induced per Gy and per DNA unit (200 Mbp). RESULTS: The existence of an inter-individual variation in the parameter (x) is described through the range (0.40-4.72 dsb/Gy/DNA unit) of values found, which have been fitted to the mathematical model defined by the log-normal distribution (mu = 0.42+/-0.03; sigma = 0.52+/-0.03; R(2)=0.9475). A total of 189 patients received radiotherapy after surgical treatment. Among them, we have detected 15 patients who developed severe skin reactions and we have compared their radiosensitivity values with the rest of patients treated. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that DNA initial damage measured on lymphocytes offers an approach to predict the acute response of human normal tissues prior to radiotherapy. Values of x higher than 3.20 dsb/Gy/DNA unit theoretically should correspond to the highly radio-sensitive patients. Using the experimental results, we have calculated the strength of the test by means of the area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (A(Z)) to determine whether the radiosensitivity assay can discriminate between patients according to their radiation response. The value found (A(Z)=0.675+/-0.072) is indicative of a fair-poor discriminating capacity of the test to identify the patients with higher risk of developing a severe acute reaction during the radiotherapy treatment.
7485742	Glutathione s-transferase genotypes as risk factors for head and neck cancer.	BACKGROUND: Several enzymatic systems, including glutathione S-transferases, are involved in the metabolism of environmental agents. The absence of glutathione S-transferases mu (GSTM1) and theta (GSTT1) results in decreased detoxification of carcinogens, for example, chemicals in cigarette smoke. These metabolic deficiencies may predispose individuals to the development of smoking-related tumors, such as cancers of the lung, head and neck, and bladder. METHODS: The glutathione S-transferase genotypes of 186 previously untreated patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and 42 healthy controls were determined with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodologies. Lymphocytes separated from heparinized peripheral blood or whole blood extracts served as sources of genomic DNA. The presence or absence of the gene-specific PCR products revealed the positive or negative genotypes, respectively. RESULTS: The absence of the GSTM1 genotype conferred an odds ratio of 2.37, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was 1.20 to 4.67. The absence of the GSTT1 gene conferred an odds ratio of 1.47 (CI 0.71 to 3.02). In the population of 42 patients and their matched 42 controls, the absence of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes conferred odds ratios of 3.10 (CI 1.24 to 7.75) and 2.18 (CI 0.91 to 5.23), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the small study size, our preliminary data suggest that genetically determined factors of carcinogen metabolism may be associated with increased risk for head and neck cancer.
12433731	The null genotype of glutathione s-transferase M1 and T1 locus increases the risk for thyroid cancer.	Susceptibility to chemical carcinogens plays an important role in the development of most cancers. Several polymorphisms of human drug-metabolizing enzymes influence this individual susceptibility. The genes that encode the isoenzymes of the glutathione s-transferase (GST) system present a polymorphic inheritance. The GST mu 1 (GSTM1) and GST theta 1 (GSTT1) genes have a null allele variant in which the entire gene is absent. The null genotype for both enzymes has been associated with many different types of tumors. To look for the influence of the inheritance pattern of these enzymes on thyroid cancer risk, we used a triplex PCR that included beta-globin gene as a DNA quality control to compare 300 normal individuals of our population to 116 goiter patients. There were 49 cases of benign and 67 cases of malignant nodules: 50 papillary and 17 follicular carcinomas. Comparison between thyroid tumor specimens and normal corresponding samples of 35 cancer patients demonstrated identical patterns, suggesting that the GST system is not involved in the process of follicular dedifferentiation. There was no statistical difference between the prevalence of the deleted alleles in the normal individuals and in the goiter patients. However, papillary carcinoma patients (10%) and follicular carcinoma patients (17%) presented a higher prevalence of the null genotype than the normal population individuals (5%; P < 0.05). We found a 2.6 increased risk of thyroid cancer in individuals with the GSTT1 and GSTM1 combined null inheritance, suggesting that this genotype may be associated with an increased susceptibility to thyroid cancer.
12579293	Glutathione S-transferase M1 associated with cancer occurrence in Korean HNPCC families carrying the hMLH1/hMSH2 mutation.	Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), an inherited cancer predisposition syndrome, has been associated with germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. However, because all mutation carriers of hMLH1/hMSH2 do not account for CRC susceptibility, modifying genes may play a role in the variation of disease expression. In this study, we determined the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes in 104 family members representing 19 Korean HNPCCs carrying hMLH1/hMSH2 mutation, and investigated the influence of GSTM1 and GSTT1 geno-/phenotype status on both age at diagnosis of CRC and cancer occurrence. The overall frequency of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 geno-/phenotype in 55 non-carriers, compared with that in mutation carriers (n=49), was not significantly different, and no significant correlation was found between mean age at diagnosis and the allelomorphs encoding the GSTM1 or GSTT1 enzymes. However, a comparison of the allele frequencies of GSTM1 in affected (n=30) and unaffected (n=19) mutation carriers revealed a significant difference, as the null allele was more prevalent in individuals with cancer (p=0.03; odds ratio, 3.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-12.7). Our results suggest that the genotypes of GSTM1 are associated with cancer occurrence in Korean HNPCC family members carrying the hMLH1/hMSH2 mutation. However, a bias due to the small sample size of this study cannot be rule out. Although evidence that GST genotypes are associated with increased cancer risk has often been controversial, the genotyping of GSTM1 could have implications for genetic counseling and the management of MMR gene mutation carriers.
10681096	Are individuals with glutathione S-transferase GSTT1 null genotype more susceptible to in vitro oxidative damage?	Recent epidemiological studies proposed that glutathione S-transferase (GST) T1 null genotype was correlated with an increased susceptibility to diseases associated with oxidative stress, including cancer. A comparative study using erythrocytes from individuals with GSTT1 null genotype was carried out to determine how resistance to oxidative stress is affected by lack of this gene, and whether the GST status of a person is an important factor in risk toward oxidant chemicals. Malondialdehyde and carbonyl levels and fluorescence and chemiluminescence formation were used as biomarkers of oxidative stress in erythrocytes exposed in vitro to cumene hydroperoxide (CumOOH), an oxidizing agent. When peroxidation-dependent changes in these parameters were compared between GSTT1 null genotype and controls, who are both GSTM1 and GSTT1 positive, no significant differences were found between the two genotypes, although the erythrocytes of the GSTT1 null group had lower GSTT1 activity toward CumOOH. Our results indicate that erythrocytes from individuals with GSTT1 null genotype are not abnormally susceptible to CumOOH-induced oxidant challenge.
7602788	[Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs)].	Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of multifunctional detoxifying enzymes that catalyse the conjugation of glutathione with large number of compounds bearing an electrophilic center, including carcinogens, and also bind a variety of nonsubstrate ligands. The transferases are widely distributed in the mammalian species and can be grouped into three classes on the basis of subunit composition: alpha (basic), mu (neutral), and pi (acidic). The liver is an organ possessing abundant GST-alpha. GST-mu is also present in the liver and lymphocytes, but this is absent in approximately 50% of the human population. GST-pi (originally found in the placenta) is widely located in the lung, kidney, GI tract, erythrocytes and cancer cells. The present review describes a new nomenclature of human GST isoenzymes and recent investigations of this enzymes, including ours. Implications of each isoenzyme are also discussed.
9150188	Expression of p53, glutathione S-transferase-pi, and Bcl-2 proteins and benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: In clinical breast cancer research, the utility of certain biomarkers as predictors of response to surgery, chemotherapy, or hormonal therapy has been studied intensively. Much less research has been done on the relevance of biologic predictors of response to radiotherapy, which represents an effective local-regional treatment for breast cancer. PURPOSE: The utility of biomarkers involved in DNA damage repair (p53 protein), control of programmed cell death (p53 and Bcl-2 proteins), and cellular detoxification (glutathione S-transferase-pi [GST-pi] enzyme) in predicting local breast cancer recurrence was analyzed retrospectively in two cohorts of breast cancer patients. These patients had had no detectable metastases in the axillary lymph nodes (i.e., node-negative) or in distant sites and had had similar distributions of clinicopathologic and biologic prognostic features. They had been treated by conservative surgery alone (139 case patients) or by conservative surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (496 case patients) during the period from 1984 through 1990. METHODS: The expression of the p53, GST-pi, and Bcl-2 proteins in the specimens of primary breast tumor obtained from these patients was determined by use of immunohistochemistry; cell proliferation activity and levels of steroid receptors were determined by use of a [3H]thymidine-labeling index assay and the dextran-coated charcoal technique, respectively. The median time of follow-up of patients was 6 years. In the analyses of patient outcomes, only local failures that presented as first events were considered. RESULTS: After surgery alone, the risk of local recurrence at 6 years was higher for patients with tumors exhibiting elevated levels of p53 and GST-pi protein expression than for patients with low levels (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-7.7, two-sided P = .012; HR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.1-6.4, two-sided P = .026, respectively). Weak or no observable expression of Bcl-2 protein was only suggestive of a higher frequency of local failures. Adjustment for patient age, tumor size, cell proliferation, and estrogen receptor status did not change these findings. Conversely, in the series of patients given conservative surgery followed by radiotherapy, there was no difference in local tumor recurrence between patients with tumors expressing or not expressing each of the three markers. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides indirect evidence of a benefit from radiation therapy in preventing local breast cancer relapse, particularly among node-negative patients with tumors that express elevated levels of the p53 or GST-pi proteins or that express little or no Bcl-2 protein.
12767525	Prognostic potential of glutathione S-transferase M1 and T1 null genotypes for gastric cancer progression.	To improve understanding of glutathione S-transferase (GST) behavior in terms of a development and prognostic factor for gastric adenocarcinoma, we investigated the association between the GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes and gastric cancer risk or the prognostic value of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes was evaluated. Using a polymerase chain reaction-based method, the frequencies of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes and prognostic factors, such as staging, differentiation, and histologic type (intestinal vs. diffuse), were evaluated in 80 patients with curatively resected primary gastric adenocarcinoma. The frequencies of GSTM1 and GSTT1 null individuals were higher in the gastric cancer group, but the differences were not statistically significant (for GSTM1 null odds ratio (OR)=0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.49-1.51 and for GSTT1, OR=0.97; 95% CI=0.55-1.71). Since the GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes are potential indicators of gastric adenocarcinoma, we examined the relationship between the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes and prognostic factors. In terms of the histologically diffuse type of cancer, GSTM1 indicated an approximately 3.24-fold increase (OR=3.24; 95% CI=1.05-10.17). With respect to gastric cancer differentiation, the frequency of the GSTM1 null genotype was linked with a statistically significant increase in risk (3.42-fold) for the high-grade type (OR=3.42; CI=1.02-13.24). Our results indicate that there is no obvious relationship between GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms and the development of gastric cancer. However, in Korean gastric adenocarcinoma patients the GSTM1 null genotype appears to be associated with a poorer prognosis.
7612694	"On the ""door-corridor"" model of gel electrophoresis. I. Equations describing the relationship between mobility and size of DNA fragments and protein-SDS complexes."	In a gel, electrophoretic mobility of a DNA fragment and a protein-SDS complex is an exponential function of the ratio between two forces, the resisting force of the gel polymers and the electrokinetic force of the migrating macromolecule. It is also proportional to the mobility of unit size of the migrating molecule, mu 1. Each gel gives an optimal resolution of macromolecules of a defined size. That size must be such that the electrokinetic force of the migrating molecule equals the gel resistance force, so that the ratio of mobility and mu 1 becomes e-1. The optima for several poly[N-acryloyl-tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane], polyacrylamide and agarose gels are given. Only two constants are sufficient for description of the relationship between mobility and size of DNA fragments and protein-SDS complexes of the sizes close to that optimally resolved. One is mu 1 and the other, ks, is the slope of the straight line which can be obtained from the size versus reciprocal of the mobility plot. The experimentally observed sigmoidal curves in the plots including the logarithm of size follow directly from the developed equations. The use of mu 1 instead of mu 0 may provide a better interpretation of the Ferguson plots.
10366541	Detoxification of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene in MCF7 breast cancer cells expressing glutathione S-transferase P1-1 and/or multidrug resistance protein 1.	We examined the roles of glutathione S-transferase (GST) P1-1 and the glutathione S-conjugate (GS-X) transporter, multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1), singly or in combination, in the detoxification of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). Derivatives of MCF7 breast carcinoma cells expressing GST P1-1 and MRP1 alone or in combination were developed. Detoxification was measured in cells as formation of the glutathione conjugate of CDNB, S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-glutathione (DNP-SG), efflux of DNP-SG, and ultimately protection from CDNB cytotoxicity. MRP1 expression in the absence of GST P1-1 confers a three- to fourfold resistance to CDNB, which is associated with a >10-fold increase in the maximum rate of DNP-SG efflux. DNP-SG efflux in MRP1-expressing MCF7 cells was ATP-dependent and exhibited an apparent Km for DNP-SG of 95 microM. MRP1 expression alone, however, had no effect on DNP-SG formation. Combined expression of GST P1-1 and MRP1 increased the rates of DNP-SG formation when cells were exposed to 10 microM CDNB. Moreover, combined expression of GSTP1-1 with MRP1 moderately augmented MRP1-mediated resistance to CDNB but only during short term (10 min) exposures to CDNB where IC50 values were in the 8-10 microM range. In contrast, expression of GST P1-1 in the absence of MRP1 slightly sensitized cells to the toxicity of CDNB (10 min exposures), despite increasing rates of DNP-SG formation. The sensitization to CDNB in cells expressing GST P1-1 alone was associated with increased intracellular accumulation of DNP-SG, indicating that DNP-SG may contribute to CDNB toxicity. The potential toxicity of DNP-SG is also suggested by the finding that inhibition of DNP-SG formation by prior glutathione depletion confers resistance to CDNB cytotoxicity in MRP1-poor MCF7 cells. Altogether, our results demonstrate that glutathione conjugation and MRP1-mediated conjugate efflux can operate together to confer resistance to CDNB. The data indicate that MRP1-mediated conjugate efflux is required for cytoprotection from CDNB because its conjugate (DNP-SG), when present at high intracellular levels, may also be toxic to cells.
9214613	Serum, plasma and paraffin-embedded tissues as sources of DNA for studying cancer susceptibility genes.	The ability to isolate DNA from archived human serum, plasma and paraffin-embedded human tissues enhances opportunities to study breast, lung and other cancer risk factors. We report herein a simple and fast protocol for the extraction of genomic DNA from these sources. Using a phenol-based extraction method, the recovery for DNA is quantitative and reproducible. DNA yields in serum (250 microl) were between 162 and 1060 ng (n = 18 subjects), in plasma (250 microl) were between 165 and 375 ng (n = 5 subjects) and in embedded tissues (5-microm thick sections for ethanol fixed, and between 5- and 20-microm sections for formaldehyde fixation) were between 1 microg and 11.7 microg (n = 32 subjects). The extraction method was combined with newly designed PCR-based assays for cancer susceptibility marker genes such as CYP1A1 (exon 7), CYP2E1 (Dra1, Rsa1), GSTM1 and NAT2 [NAT2*5A (C481T), NAT2*6A (G590A), NAT2*7A (G857A)]. Genotyping results from the serum and paraffin-embedded tissues compared favorably to results from archived freshly frozen tissues, where concordance was 98% for serum, 100% for ethanol-fixed embedded tissues, and 97% for formaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues. This facile method will allow for the use of archived tissue samples of prospective cohort and other studies where intact DNA was not previously available.
11416960	Expression of HER-2/NEU oncoprotein in familial and non-familial breast cancer.	The HER-2/neu proto-oncogene amplification or oncoprotein overexpression is an important prognostic factor and a predictive factor for resistance to endocrine therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancers. Moreover, it is an entry criterion in the assessment of patients for whom Herceptin (Trastuzumab) treatment is considered. The overexpression rate of HER-2/neu oncoprotein has been identified in 10% to 40% of human breast cancers. In Taiwan, a higher grade of pathobiologic characteristics of familial breast cancer was also noted than that found in the non-familial group. It is worthwhile to evaluate whether the overexpression is more frequent in familial breast cancers. Fifty-six familial and 111 non-familial breast cancers were studied between 1990 and 1999 to assess both the overexpression of HER-2/neu oncoprotein immunohistochemically and the correlation with the histological type, grade and stage of breast carcinoma. The overexpression rate is higher in the familial breast cancer group (50.0%) when compared with non-familial breast cancer group (36.9%), which did not prove to be statistically significant (P = 0.1068). However, when the infiltrating ductal carcinomas of both groups are compared, it is statistically significant (52.3% vs. 33.7%, P = 0.0429). Overexpression correlated with node status and histological grade of infiltrating ductal carcinomas in non-familial and overall breast cancers. It also correlated with nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic counts, but not tubule formation or tumor size. All 3 cases of Paget's disease revealed overexpression, whereas all 12 cases of mucinous and one case of metaplastic carcinoma and one case of medullary carcinoma were negative. The overexpression rate was higher both in familial and non-familial intraductal carcinomas (57.1% vs. 73.3%, P = 0.4716). No statistical difference was identified between the 2 subsets. A case of infiltrating ductal carcinoma combined with intraductal carcinoma revealed heterogeneous staining in the component of ductal carcinoma in situ, while the invasive component did not. This suggests that overexpression decreases within individual tumors as they evolve from in situ to invasive lesioins. The HER-2/neu may imply a different role in intraductal carcinoma, Paget's disease and invasive duct carcinoma. Although the overexpression rate of HER-2/neu oncoprotein of familial breast cancer was not significantly higher than that of the non-familial group, it is appropriate to evaluate the rate of HER-2/neu overexpression according to the histological type of breast cancers from familial breast cancer and non-familial breast cancer. The prognoses will be needed for future evaluation.
11857015	A comprehensive model for familial breast cancer incorporating BRCA1, BRCA2 and other genes.	In computing the probability that a woman is a BRCA1 or BRCA2 carrier for genetic counselling purposes, it is important to allow for the fact that other breast cancer susceptibility genes may exist. We used data from both a population based series of breast cancer cases and high risk families in the UK, with information on BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status, to investigate the genetic models that can best explain familial breast cancer outside BRCA1 and BRCA2 families. We also evaluated the evidence for risk modifiers in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. We estimated the simultaneous effects of BRCA1, BRCA2, a third hypothetical gene 'BRCA3', and a polygenic effect using segregation analysis. The hypergeometric polygenic model was used to approximate polygenic inheritance and the effect of risk modifiers. BRCA1 and BRCA2 could not explain all the observed familial clustering. The best fitting model for the residual familial breast cancer was the polygenic, although a model with a single recessive allele produced a similar fit. There was also significant evidence for a modifying effect of other genes on the risks of breast cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Under this model, the frequency of BRCA1 was estimated to be 0.051% (95% CI: 0.021-0.125%) and of BRCA2 0.068% (95% CI: 0.033-0.141%). The breast cancer risk by age 70 years, based on the average incidence over all modifiers was estimated to be 35.3% for BRCA1 and 50.3% for BRCA2. The corresponding ovarian cancer risks were 25.9% for BRCA1 and 9.1% for BRCA2. The findings suggest that several common, low penetrance genes with multiplicative effects on risk may account for the residual non-BRCA1/2 familial aggregation of breast cancer. The modifying effect may explain the previously reported differences between population based estimates for BRCA1/2 penetrance and estimates based on high-risk families.
7522434	Hormone-nuclear receptor interactions in health and disease. The oestrogen receptor.	During the past 30 years, we have learned a great deal about the molecular details whereby the ovarian hormone elicits the feminizing effects that Knauer described in his experiments over a century ago. The ER plays a pivotal role in this process, and potentially in many other physiological processes. The roles of variant receptors, the details of ER-mediated transactivation and the regulation of ER expression and activation are just a few of the important unresolved issues in this field. These are not trivial problems, and their solutions are likely to require much more investigation. This information will provide important clinical insight into breast cancer, lipid metabolism, bone metabolism, prostatic hyperplasia and other diseases. Armed with this basic knowledge, scientists will be better equipped to design rational therapeutic and preventive strategies to combat these major clinical problems.
12611452	Family history of breast and ovarian cancer and the risk of breast carcinoma in situ.	UNLABELLED: A family history of breast cancer is an important risk factor for breast carcinoma in situ (BCIS), however, there are no detailed analyses of its variation in effect by number, type, laterality or age at onset of affected relatives nor by association with ovarian cancer. In addition, the role of the breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, in the development of BCIS is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To better define the role of: (1) a family history of breast and ovarian cancer and (2) the cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, in the development of BCIS. METHODS: The data are 875 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and 123 lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) cases diagnosed among residents of the state of Connecticut from September 15, 1994 to March 14, 1998 and between the age of 20 and 79 years. Controls (n = 999) are female Connecticut residents collected via random-digit-dial and frequency matched to the cases by 5-year age intervals. Telephone interviews were used to collect information on risk factors and cancer screening history. Logistic regression was used to provide maximum likelihood estimates of the odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The probability of being a BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 gene carrier was calculated for each case and control, using family history of breast and ovarian cancer, age/age at diagnosis for relatives, prevalence and penetrance data for BRCA1/BRCA2, and self-report of Jewish heritage. RESULTS: Cases with DCIS or LCIS were significantly more likely to report a first degree family history of breast cancer (OR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.3, 2.1 and 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.9, respectively) than were controls. In addition, DCIS cases were 2.4 (95% Cl: 0.8, 7.2) times more likely than controls to report both an affected mother and sister. An inverse association was suggested between age at onset and DCIS risk with cases aged 49 years or younger at 2.1 (95% CI: 1.3, 3.4) times the risk of controls (95% CI) versus 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1, 2.0) for cases older than 49 years. An elevated risk of DCIS was associated with a family history of ovarian cancer but did not reach statistical significance (OR: 1.3, 95% CI: 0.7, 2.5). Approximately 3.7% and 1.9% of DCIS cases were predicted to carry a mutation in BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A family history of breast cancer is associated with an increased risk of DCIS and LCIS, particularly among women with multiple relatives affected at early ages. Statistical risk models predict a low prevalence rate of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in DCIS; these estimates await confirmation through laboratory testing.
8956789	Epithelial ovarian cancer: influence of polymorphism at the glutathione S-transferase GSTM1 and GSTT1 loci on p53 expression.	The importance of polymorphism in the glutathione S-transferase GSTM1, GSTT1 and, cytochrome P450, CYP2D6 loci in the pathogenesis of epithelial ovarian cancer has been assessed in two studies; firstly, a case-control study designed to determine the influence of these genes on susceptibility to this cancer, and secondly, the putative role of these genes in the protection of host cell DNA has been studied by comparing p53 expression in patients with different GSTM1, GSTT1 and CYP2D6 genotypes. The frequencies of GSTM1, GSTT1 and CYP2D6 genotypes in 84 cases and 325 controls were not different. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect p53 expression in 63 of these tumours. Expression was found in 23 tumours. Of the patients demonstrating immunopositivity, 20 (87%) were GSTM1 null. The frequency distributions of GSTM1 genotypes in p53-positive and -negative samples were significantly different (P = 0.002) and those for GSTT1 genotypes approached significance (exact P = 0.057). The proportion of patients with both GSTM1 null and GSTT1 null was also significantly greater in the immunopositive (4/22) than in the immunonegative group (1/40) (P = 0.0493). Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was used to detect mutations in the 23 tumour samples demonstrating p53 positivity. A shift in electrophoretic mobility of amplified fragments was found in 11 patients (exons 5, 6, 7 and 8) and these exons were sequenced. In eight samples a mutation was found. No SCCP variants were identified in the other 12 immunopositive patients. Sequencing of exons 4-9 of p53 from these tumours resulted in the detection of mutations in two patients (exons 5 and 7). Thus, in 23 patients who demonstrated immunopositivity, p53 mutations were found in nine patients with GSTM1 null (90.0%). In the 13 patients in whom no mutations were identified, 11 were GSTM1 null (84.6%). The data show that overexpression of p53 is associated with the GSTM1 null genotype. We propose the data are compatible with the view that GSTM1 and GSTT1 are critical in the detoxification of the products of oxidative stress produced during the repair of the ovarian epithelium. Thus, failure to detoxify products of this stress may result in damage to various genes in the host cell, including to p53, resulting in persistent expression of mutant protein. In other patients, oxidative stress effects damage to various genes, but not including p53, resulting in overexpression of wild-type p53.
9111645	Glutathione S-transferase activity and subunit composition in transitional cell cancer and mucosa of the human bladder.	OBJECTIVES: Clinical data indicate that drug resistance to chemotherapy may occur in all stages of transitional cell cancer (TCC). Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of detoxification enzymes composed of four different classes, denoted alpha (GSTA), mu (GSTM), pi (GSTP), and theta (GSTT), each containing one or more homo- or heterodimeric isoforms (GSTA1-1, GSTA1-2, and so forth), GSTs play a prominent role in drug detoxification and have been associated with resistance of tumor cells to anticancer agents. GST activity and isoenzyme levels were studied in TCC and normal bladder mucosa. METHODS: Enzyme activity was studied in samples of TCC (n = 37), adjacent normal bladder mucosa (n = 37), and in bladder mucosa of control patients without TCC (n = 46). GST isoenzyme composition was studied in mucosa and TCC of 14 patients and 11 controls. RESULTS: The mucosa of patients with TCC showed GST activity (191 +/- 21 nmol/min/mg cytosolic protein), similar to the mucosa of controls (176 +/- 15 nmol/min/mg). GST activity was significantly increased in TCC (666 +/- 157 nmol/min/mg) in comparison with adjacent mucosa (P < 0.003). In mucosa samples, the levels of GSTA (A1-1, A1-2, and A2-2) were below the detection limit in 92% of the samples. GSTM (GSTM1-1) was found in 9 controls and in 7 patients with TCC but not in the other 7 patients, whereas GSTP (GSTP1-1) could be detected in all samples. The levels of GSTM1-1 and GSTP1-1 were similar in mucosa of patients and controls. The mean relative increase of GSTP1-1 levels in TCC was 4.6-fold (P < 0.002). In the 7 patients with GSTM1-1-detectable expression in adjacent normal mucosa, mean GSTM1-1 levels in TCC were increased 2.8-fold compared with mean levels in normal adjacent mucosa (P < 0.02). GSTA was measured in five samples of TCC at relatively low levels. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of GSTP1-1 and GSTM1-1 may suggest that in the process of TCC carcinogenesis, a selection pressure occurs, resulting in a tumor with enhanced detoxification properties, including that of therapeutic drugs.
10077151	Glutathione S-transferase GSTM1, GSTM3, GSTP1 and GSTT1 genotypes and the risk of smoking-related oral and pharyngeal cancers.	Several polymorphic glutathione S-transferase enzymes are involved in the detoxification of active metabolites of many potential carcinogens from tobacco smoke and may therefore be important in modulating susceptibility to smoking-related cancers. As part of a hospital-based case-control study performed in France among Caucasian smokers, we studied GSTM1, GSTM3, GSTP1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphisms in 121 patients with oral cavity and pharyngeal cancers and 172 hospital controls using peripheral blood DNA. An increase in risk was found among carriers of the GSTP1 (AG or GG) genotype (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0-2.8, p = 0.07) or the GSTT1 null genotype (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-4.0, p = 0.05). The effect of these at-risk genotypes was most marked in subjects with a history of more than 30 years of smoking, among whom the respective ORs were 2.0 (95% CI 1.0-3.9) and 3.3 (95% CI 1.3-8.1), though the interaction tests between these genotypes and duration of smoking were not significant. In contrast, neither the GSTM1 null genotype nor the GSTM3 AA genotype was associated with oropharyngeal cancer risk (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.5-1.5 and OR = 1.3, 95% CI 0.7-2.3, respectively). Our results thus suggest that GSTP1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphisms modulate susceptibility to smoking-related cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx.
12195642	GSTM-1 and NAT2 and genetic alterations in colon tumors.	OBJECTIVE: Phase II metabolizing enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases and N-acetyltransferase are involved in the detoxification of carcinogens. Genetic variants of genes coding for these enzymes have been evaluated as to their association with colon cancer, both as independent risk factors and as effect modifiers for associations with diet and cigarette smoking. In this study, we evaluate associations between the GSTM-1 genotype and the NAT2-imputed phenotype and acquired mutations in tumors. METHODS: Data is taken from a set of 1836 cases and 1958 controls with colon cancer who were part of a large case-control study of colon cancer and whose tumors were previously analyzed for Ki-ras, p53, and microsatellite instability (MSI). We also evaluate the modifying effects of these genetic variants with diet and cigarette smoking, factors previously identified as being associated with specific tumor alterations. RESULTS: Neither GSTM-1 nor the NAT2-imputed phenotype was independently associated with Ki-ras, p53, or MSI. Cigarette smoking significantly increased the risk of tumors involving the MSI pathway. Additionally, cigarette smoking doubled the risk of p53 transversion mutations among those who were GSTM-1 present. Cases were slightly more likely to have a p53 mutation if they frequently consumed red meat and had the imputed NAT2 intermediate/rapid phenotype relative to slow phenotype/infrequent consumers of red meat (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3-3.0 for intermediate/rapid). CONCLUSIONS: These data provide support that diet and cigarette smoking may be associated with specific disease pathways, although GSTM-1 and NAT2 do not independently appear to alter susceptibility to these diet and lifestyle factors.
8781385	The role of individual susceptibility in cancer burden related to environmental exposure.	Individual susceptibility to cancer may result from host factors including differences n metabolism, DNA repair, altered expression of protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and nutritional status. Since most carcinogens require metabolic activation before binding to DNA, variations in an individual's metabolic phenotype that have detected in enzymes involved in activation and detoxification should play an essential role in the development of environmental cancer. This phenotypic metabolic variation has now been related to genetic polymorphisms, and many genes encoding carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes have been identified and cloned. Consequently, allelic variants or genetic defects that give rise to the observed variation and new polymorphisms have been recognized. Development of simple polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays has enabled identification of an individual's genotype for a variety of metabolic polymorphisms. Thus, recent knowledge of the genetic basis for individual metabolic variation has opened new possibilities of studies focusing on increased individual susceptibility to environmentally induced cancer, which are reviewed with special reference to smoking-induced lung cancer. Cancer susceptibility due to chemical exposure is likely to be determined by an individual's phenotype for a number of enzymes (both activating and detoxifying) relevant to that of a single carcinogen or mixtures of carcinogens. Given the number and variability in expression of carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes and the complexity of chemical exposures, assessment of a single polymorphic enzyme (genotype) may not be sufficient. Mutations in the p53 gene are among the most common genetic changes in human cancer. The frequency and type p53 mutations can act as a fingerprint of carcinogen exposure and may therefore provide information about external etiological agents, intensity of exposure, and host factors affecting the tumorigenesis process. In human lung cancer, p53 mutations (both the mutation pattern and frequency) have been linked with tobacco smoking; the type of mutation most frequently observed is G:C to T:A transversion, a mutation preferentially induced by benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide. An association between the presence of this transversion and the genotype deficient in glutathione S-transferase M1-mediated detoxification has been observed in lung cancer. Taken together, these findings suggest that determination of metabolic at risk genotypes in combination with levels of DNA adducts in target (surrogate) tissues and the p53 mutation pattern should allow the identification of susceptible individuals and subgroups in carcinogen-exposed populations.
10353781	Risk factors for detecting germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder mutations in Ashkenazi Jewish women with breast or ovarian cancer.	We ascertained 184 Ashkenazi Jewish women with breast/ovarian cancer (171 breast and 13 ovarian cancers, two of the former also had ovarian cancer) in a self-referral study. They were tested for germline founder mutations in BRCA1 (185delAG, 5382insC, 188del11) and BRCA2 (6174delT). Personal/family histories were correlated with mutation status. Logistic regression was used to develop a model to predict those breast cancer cases likely to be germline BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers in this population. The most important factors were age at diagnosis, personal/family history of ovarian cancer, or breast cancer diagnosed before 60 years in a first degree relative. A total of 15.8% of breast cancer cases, one of 13 ovarian cancer cases (7.7%), and both cases with ovarian and breast cancer carried one of the founder mutations. Age at diagnosis in carriers (44.6 years) was significantly lower than in non-carriers (52.1 years) (p<0.001), and was slightly lower in BRCA1 than BRCA2 carriers. Thirty three percent of carriers had no family history of breast or ovarian cancer in first or second degree relatives. Conversely, 12% of non-mutation carriers had strong family histories, with both a first and a second degree relative diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer. The predicted values from the logistic model can be used to define criteria for identifying Ashkenazi Jewish women with breast cancer who are at high risk of carrying BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. The following criteria would identify those at approximately 10% risk: (1) breast cancer <50 years, (2) breast cancer <60 years with a first degree relative with breast cancer <60 years, or (3) breast cancer <70 years and a first or second degree relative with ovarian cancer.
12540498	Genetic polymorphisms in GSTM1, -P1, -T1, and CYP2E1 and the risk of adult brain tumors.	GST and CYP2E1 genes are involved in metabolism of several compounds (e.g., solvents) that may play a role in brain cancer etiology. We evaluated associations between polymorphisms in these genes and adult brain tumor incidence. Cases were 782 patients with brain tumors diagnosed from 1994 to 1998 at three United States hospitals. Controls were 799 patients admitted to the same hospitals for nonmalignant conditions. DNA was extracted from blood samples that had been collected from 1277 subjects (80% of all subjects; 604 controls; 422 gliomas, 172 meningiomas, and 79 acoustic neuromas), and genotyping was successfully conducted for GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null, GSTP I105V, GSTP A114V, CYP2E1 RsaI, and CYP2E1 Ins96. The GSTP1 105 Val/Val genotype was associated with increased glioma incidence [odds ratio (OR), 1.8; 95% confidence limits (CLs), 1.2, 2.7], with the estimated effect following a trend of increasing magnitude by number of variant alleles (Ile/Ile: OR, 1.0; Ile/Val: OR, 1.3; Val/Val: OR, 2.1). The CYP2E1 RsaI variant was weakly associated with glioma (OR, 1.4; 95% CL, 0.9, 2.4) and acoustic neuroma (OR, 2.3; 95% CL, 1.0, 5.3), with some indication of stronger associations among younger subjects. Estimated effects of the gene variants differed by glioma subtype. There was evidence of supermultiplicativity of the joint effect of GSTP1 I105V and CYP2E1 RsaI variants on both glioma and acoustic neuroma, even following adjustment of estimates toward a common prior distribution using hierarchical regression models. Previously reported associations between the GSTT1 null genotype and overall glioma incidence were not replicated, but an association with meningioma was observed (OR, 1.5; 95% CL, 1.0, 2.3). These findings may provide clues to both genetic and environmental determinants of brain tumors.
9230131	Subunit diversity and tissue distribution of human glutathione S-transferases: interpretations based on electrospray ionization-MS and peptide sequence-specific antisera.	Uncertainties about the composition and identities of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) in human tissue have impeded studies on their biological functions. A rigorous protocol has therefore been developed to characterize the human proteins. Cytosolic GST subunits were resolved by reverse-phase HPLC methods, individual components were assigned to Alpha, Mu and Pi classes on the basis of their immunoreactivities, and peptide-sequence-specific antisera were used to distinguish among five different Mu-class subunits (GSTM1-GSTM5). Each subunit type was characterized and identified unambiguously by electrospray ionization-MS. Acetylation of N-terminal residues in the GSTA1, GSTA2, GSTM3 and GSTM4 subunits were the only natural post-translational modifications detected. The unique structure of GSTM3, with N- and C-terminal peptide extensions predicted from cDNA sequences, was confirmed. Only testis and brain were rich sources of GSTM3 subunits. Subunit profiles were distinct and characteristic of the particular tissue type, and this tissue specificity in GST expression was evident even in organs from different individuals. For instance, livers had relatively simple GST compositions, consisting of a preponderance of Alpha-class subunits and GSTM1 (when present). By contrast, representation of most subunit types was a characteristic feature of testis, which had the highest levels of GSTs. GSTM4 and GSTM5 subunits, here identified for the first time in human tissue extracts, were minor components, with GSTM5 found only in brain, lung and testis. Specimens devoid of GSTM1 subunits, particularly those from null-genotype individuals, were readily discerned at the protein level. Liver was the only rich source of the GSTM1 subunit (although it also constituted a major fraction of adrenal GSTs), and so the functional consequences of the GSTM1 gene deletion are likely to vary in extrahepatic tissues.
9276626	Glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) and T1 (GSTT1) polymorphisms and lung cancer risk among Northwestern Mediterraneans.	Several polymorphic genes including those encoding for glutathione S-transferases (GST) have been reported to be involved in modifying lung cancer risk in smokers. The gene GSTM1 is frequently deleted in humans and a possible association between the null genotype and lung cancer risk is controversial. Another polymorphic gene of the same supergene family, GSTT1, is also involved in the detoxification of some environmental carcinogens. Both genes were genotyped in (a) a group of lung cancer patients (n = 160); (b) a group of healthy smokers (n = 120); (c) a group of blood donors from the general population (n = 192). All patients and controls were Northwestern Mediterranean Caucasians. The results show that the GSTM1 null genotype (GSTM1*0/GSTM1*0) was slightly over represented in the lung cancer patients (frequency of 58%; OR: 1.40, 95% CI: 0.74-2.61, referred to healthy smokers). The histological type most clearly modified was small cell carcinoma (frequency of 62.2%, OR: 1.91, CI: 0.78-4.69). The subdivision of the patients with one or two copies of the GSTM1 gene according to a GSTM1*A, GSTM1*B or GSTM1*A/B genotype (frequencies of 28.2%, 11.2%, 2.5% respectively) revealed no significant differences between the cases and both control groups. The frequency of the deleted GSTT1 genotype among the lung cancer patients (24%) was not significantly increased (OR: 1.08, CI: 0.57-2.05, referred to healthy smokers). The results showed that 14.4% of the patients presented homozygous deletion of both GSTT1 and GSTM1 (12.5% among healthy smokers) suggesting no potentiation between null genotypes for lung cancer risk.
9865425	NAT2, GSTM-1, cigarette smoking, and risk of colon cancer.	Cigarette smoking has been associated inconsistently with colon cancer. The extent to which genetic profile influences susceptibility to the inducement of colon cancer by cigarette smoking is not known. In this study, we evaluated the associations between smoking cigarettes and polymorphisms of the NAT2 and GSTM-1 genes using data obtained from an incident case-control study of 1993 cases of colon cancer and 2410 age- and sex- matched controls. Neither NAT2 nor GSTM-1 polymorphisms were significantly associated with colon cancer, except among older women, in whom the intermediate/rapid imputed phenotype was associated with increased risk of colon cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.0-1.81. Using several indicators of cigarette smoking, we observed no significant interaction between these genotypes and cigarette smoking and colon cancer. The major variation in association with colon cancer was from the amount of cigarette exposure, with those smoking a pack or more of cigarettes per day being at an approximately 40% increased risk of colon cancer; this association did not vary by genotype. However, those who stopped smoking 5-14 years prior to diagnosis and who where intermediate/rapid acetylators were at a slightly greater risk than those who were slow acetylators (for men, OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.0-2.4; for women, OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.4-4.4). Associations were similar when proximal and distal tumors were examined and separated for age at the time of diagnosis. The lack of an association does not rule out the possibility of other genetic polymorphisms interacting with cigarette smoke to cause colon cancer, nor does it take into account individual phenotypic variability.
10819503	Use of the autopsy to study ontogeny and expression of the estrogen receptor gene in human breast.	Historically, autopsies have been a valuable resource for morphologic studies of the human breast, and have been used in conjunction with radiologic evaluation and epidemiology to provide information about population prevalence of pre-malignant and malignant disease. More recently, well-preserved post-mortem breast tissue has also been used to evaluate the status of genes and their expression. Using molecular techniques and immunohistochemistry, quantitation of gene expression and localization of proteins of hormone receptors, growth factor receptors, growth factors, cell-proliferation related antigens and proto-oncogenes can be evaluated in autopsy-derived breast tissue. Expression of the estrogen receptor (ER)3 gene at the mRNA and protein product levels has been evaluated in breast tissue from infants, children, adolescent girls, and adult women in various phases of the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and post-menopausal. The results of these studies support a role for the ER gene in early as well as pubescent breast development, and also in normal cyclical and abnormal cell proliferation in the terminal-duct-lobular-units (TDLU) of adult women.
8554067	A high incidence of BRCA1 mutations in 20 breast-ovarian cancer families.	We have analyzed 20 breast-ovarian cancer families, the majority of which show positive evidence of linkage to chromosome 17q12 for germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 gene. BRCA1 mutations cosegregating with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility were identified in 16 families, including 1 family with a case of male breast cancer. Nine of these mutations have not been reported previously. The majority of mutations were found to generate a premature stop codon leading to the formation of a truncated BRCA1 protein of 2%-88% of the expected normal length. Two mutations altered the RING finger domain. Sequencing of genomic DNA led to the identification of a mutation in the coding region of BRCA1 in 12 families, and cDNA analysis revealed an abnormal or missing BRCA1 transcript in 4 of the 8 remaining families. A total of eight mutations were associated with a reduced quantity of BRCA1 transcript. We were unable to detect BRCA1 mutations in 4 of the 20 families, but only 1 of these was clearly linked to BRCA1. It is expected that the majority of clear examples of the breast-ovarian syndrome will be associated with germ-line mutations in the coding region of BRCA1.
9538156	Differential transcriptional activation by the N-terminal region of BRCA1 splice variants BRCA1a and BRCA1b.	The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1, is a nuclear phosphoprotein which functions as a tumor suppressor in human breast cancer cells. BRCA1 protein contains an amino-terminal zinc finger motif and a carboxy-terminal acidic region. Recently, the carboxy-terminal region of BRCA1 and the amino-terminal region of BRCA2 proteins were shown to function as transactivation domains when fused to GAL4 DNA binding domain. We have recently isolated and characterized two new naturally occurring variants of BRCA1 (BRCA1a/p110 and BRCA1b/p100) which are phosphoproteins containing phosphotyrosine that associate with E2F transcriptional factors, cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases indicating a role for BRCA1 proteins in cell-cycle regulation. Here we show for the first time that the amino-terminal region of BRCA1a (BNT) but not BRCA1b can also function as a transcriptional activator when fused to GAL4 DNA binding domain. Thus, BRCA1/1a proteins contain two autonomous transcriptional activation domains, one at the amino-terminal region (BNT) and the other at the carboxy-terminal region (BCT). BRCA1b retains only the BCT domain since it has lost part of the potential BNT domain as a result of alternative splicing. Our results also suggest the presence of an inhibitory domain at the carboxy terminal region of BRCA1 and BRCA1a proteins (BID). Thus, BRCA1b protein may function as a dominant negative variant that could regulate the transcriptional activity of BRCA1/BRCA1a proteins and hence may serve as a marker for identifying individuals with greater potential for developing breast cancer. It may be possible that loss of transcriptional activation or protein-protein interactions in patients with mutations in the amino terminal zinc finger domain could deprive the cell of an important mechanism for regulating cell proliferation leading to the development of breast cancer.
9894790	Inherited breast cancer: an emerging picture.	A role for BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the control of genome integrity easily fits a tumor suppressor model. It is well established that mutations in DNA repair genes lead to genomic instability (138). Genomic instability may directly lead to tumorigenesis by allowing for the accumulation of mutations in key cell cycle regulators (139). The studies summarized here suggest that BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51. and BARD1 function as a biochemical complex. This complex apparently plays a role in one or more of the DNA damage response pathways. Experimental data suggest that BRCA1 and BRCA2 function as regulators of transcription. These observations highlight some of the fundamental questions that remain to be addressed in the study of the biology of these genes. Are the DNA repair and transcriptional regulatory functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 related? BRCA1 and BRCA2 may maintain the integrity of the genome by regulating expression of genes directly involved in this process. Alternatively, if the functions are not related, which is required for suppression of tumorigenesis? Researchers also are grappling with another paradox. If BRCA1 and BRCA2 are ubiquitously expressed, why do mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 lead specifically to tumors primarily of the breast and ovary, as well as a limited number of other tissues to a lesser degree? Nothing to date has been revealed that would explain how alteration of the transcriptional regulatory function and or the DNA repair function ascribed to BRCA1 and BRCA2 would result in tumor specificity as both of these functions are essential to a broad spectrum of tissues. It is possible that BRCAI and BRCA2 may regulate genes expressed only in the breast and ovary. Similarly, there may be unidentified BRCA1 and BRCA2 co-factors that are active only in the breast and ovary and, therefore, are critical to tumorigenesis. All breast cancer is genetic, although only a small fraction of cases are attributable to inherited genetic predisposition. Most breast cancer is due to genetic alterations that are specific to breast epithelial cells, many of which remain unknown. Integration of genetic approaches into research designed to elucidate biological pathways of breast cancer tumorigenesis will ultimately lead to new information critical to the development of new tools for the diagnosis and treatment of disease.
10220405	BRCA1 interacts with components of the histone deacetylase complex.	Germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 tumor-suppressor gene are associated with an increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA1 contains a carboxyl-terminal domain (BRCT) that is shared with several other proteins involved in maintaining genome integrity. In an effort to understand the function of BRCA1, we sought to isolate proteins that interact with the BRCT domain. Purified BRCT polypeptide was used as a probe to screen a human placenta cDNA expression library by Far Western analysis. Here we report that BRCA1 interacts in vivo and in vitro with the Rb-binding proteins, RbAp46 and RbAp48, as well as with Rb. Moreover, the BRCT domain associates with the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2. These results demonstrate that BRCA1 interacts with components of the histone deacetylase complex, and therefore may explain the involvement of BRCA1 in multiple processes such as transcription, DNA repair, and recombination.
10962436	Abnormal expression of BRCA1 and BRCA1-interactive DNA-repair proteins in breast carcinomas.	Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies among women. The molecular mechanisms involved in breast carcinogenesis, however, remain to be elucidated. Although somatic mutation of BRCA1 is rare, BRCA1 protein expression is reduced in about 30% of sporadic breast carcinomas (Yoshikawa et al., Clin. Cancer Res., 5:1249-1261, 1999), indicating its possible involvement even in sporadic breast carcinogenesis. Among the BRCA1-interactive proteins are hRAD51 (a human homologue of Escherichia coli rec A protein), BARD1 (BRCA1-associated RING domain 1) and p53, all of which are involved in DNA repair. We have analyzed the expression patterns of the hRAD51, BARD1 and p53 proteins in five breast cancer cell lines, including a BRCA1-deficient cell line, and in 179 breast cancer tissue samples from Japanese women, including 113 sporadic, 47 hereditary (i.e., BRCA1 status unknown), and 19 BRCA1-associated cases. Of the 179 breast carcinomas, fifty-four (30%) exhibited reduced hRAD51 expression, and sixty-two (35%) exhibited p53 overexpression. On the other hand, reduced expression level of BARD1, and of hMSH2 and hMLH1, which are components of DNA mismatch-repair pathway and are involved in colorectal carcinogenesis, was observed respectively in only 10 (6%), 8 (5%) and 3 (2%) cases. The overall frequency of sporadic breast carcinomas with abnormal expression of either BRCA1 or the BRCA1-interactive proteins was 67% (76/113). These results indicate that there may be an important role for the BRCA1-associated DNA-repair pathway, not only in BRCA1-associated breast carcinomas, but also in sporadic breast carcinomas.
11278247	The RING heterodimer BRCA1-BARD1 is a ubiquitin ligase inactivated by a breast cancer-derived mutation.	BRCA1-BARD1 constitutes a heterodimeric RING finger complex associated through its N-terminal regions. Here we demonstrate that the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimeric RING finger complex contains significant ubiquitin ligase activity that can be disrupted by a breast cancer-derived RING finger mutation in BRCA1. Whereas individually BRCA1 and BARD1 have very low ubiquitin ligase activities in vitro, BRCA1 combined with BARD1 exhibits dramatically higher activity. Bacterially purified RING finger domains comprising residues 1-304 of BRCA1 and residues 25-189 of BARD1 are capable of polymerizing ubiquitin. The steady-state level of transfected BRCA1 in vivo was increased by co-transfection of BARD1, and reciprocally that of transfected BARD1 was increased by BRCA1 in a dose-dependent manner. The breast cancer-derived BARD1-interaction-deficient mutant, BRCA1(C61G), does not exhibit ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro. These results suggest that the BRCA1-BARD1 complex contains a ubiquitin ligase activity that is important in prevention of breast and ovarian cancer development.
11573085	Structure of a BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimeric RING-RING complex.	The RING domain of the breast and ovarian cancer tumor suppressor BRCA1 interacts with multiple cognate proteins, including the RING protein BARD1. Proper function of the BRCA1 RING domain is critical, as evidenced by the many cancer-predisposing mutations found within this domain. We present the solution structure of the heterodimer formed between the RING domains of BRCA1 and BARD1. Comparison with the RING homodimer of the V(D)J recombination-activating protein RAG1 reveals the structural diversity of complexes formed by interactions between different RING domains. The BRCA1-BARD1 structure provides a model for its ubiquitin ligase activity, illustrates how the BRCA1 RING domain can be involved in associations with multiple protein partners and provides a framework for understanding cancer-causing mutations at the molecular level.
11712284	Systemic vasoconstrictor and renal vasodilator effects of PLV-2 (octapressin) in man.	The systemic and renal hemodynamic effects of PLV-2 (octapressin) were studied in patients with hypotension or decompensated cirrhosis of the liver. Low doses (0.004 to 0.02 units/min) increased renal blood flow (indicator-dilution technique), reduced renal vascular resistance, and produced a slight increase in arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance. Higher doses (0.1 to 0.5 units/min) produced a sharp increase in arterial pressure and systemic resistance while renal resistance increased moderately and renal blood flow usually was maintained above control levels. Renal fraction was increased at all dose levels. The increased renal blood flow was accompanied by more rapid intrarenal dye transit time and slight increase in renal extraction ratio of paraaminohippurate suggesting a rise in cortical blood flow. It is concluded that PLV-2 in small doses produces renal vasodilation and in larger doses preferential extra-renal vasoconstriction resulting in redistribution of blood flow to the kidney.
11773071	Identification of residues required for the interaction of BARD1 with BRCA1.	The breast and ovarian cancer predisposition gene product BRCA1, binds to BARD1 at its N terminus. In cells BRCA1 is found as a heterodimer with BARD1 and may represent the functionally active form of BRCA1. Using yeast two-hybrid and split-hybrid screens we have identified 16 independent missense mutations which prevent the ability of the BARD1 N terminus to heterodimerize with BRCA1. With reference to the recent structure of the BARD1center dotBRCA1 RING complex (Brzovic, P. S., Rajagopal, P., Hoyt, D. W., King, M-C., and Klevit, R. E. (2001) Nat. Struct. Biol. 8, 833--837) we note two classes of mutation; those that map to the hydrophobic core forming the BARD1:BRCA1 interface and are substitutions of leucine, and those that map to residues forming intramolecular contacts either in helical packing, or in the conserved zinc chelating cysteine residues of the RING itself. The directed mutation of charged residues predicted to play a role in the interaction could not alone prevent heterodimer formation suggesting that, while polar interactions may participate in the specificity of the interaction, they are not crucial. Together these data provide functional evidence for the requirement of a hydrophobic interface and illustrate that disruption of the tertiary structure by mutations away from the interface itself are able to prevent formation of the heterodimer.
11779501	Identification of BARD1 as mediator between proapoptotic stress and p53-dependent apoptosis.	The BRCA1-associated protein BARD1 is a putative tumor suppressor. We suggest that BARD1 is a mediator of apoptosis since (1) cell death in vivo (ischemic stroke) and in vitro is accompanied by increased levels of BARD1 protein and mRNA; (2) overexpression of BARD1 induces cell death with all features of apoptosis; and (3) BARD1-repressed cells are defective for the apoptotic response to genotoxic stress. The proapoptotic activity of BARD1 involves binding to and elevations of p53. BRCA1 is not required for but partially counteracts apoptosis induction by BARD1. A tumor-associated mutation Q564H of BARD1 is defective in apoptosis induction, thus suggesting a role of BARD1 in tumor suppression by mediating the signaling from proapoptotic stress toward induction of apoptosis.
11927591	Autoubiquitination of the BRCA1*BARD1 RING ubiquitin ligase.	The RING finger of BRCA1 confers ubiquitin ligase activity that is markedly enhanced when complexed with another RING-containing protein, BARD1, and is required for the function of this tumor suppressor protein in protecting genomic integrity. Here, we report that co-expression of BRCA1-(1-639) and BARD1 in bacteria can assemble a potent ubiquitin ligase activity. Purified BRCA1-(1-639)*BARD1 stimulated the Ubc5c-mediated monoubiquitination of histone H2A/H2AX in vitro, suggesting a possible role for BRCA1*BARD1 in modifying chromatin structure. Moreover, the truncated BRCA1*BARD1 complex exhibited efficient autoubiquitination activity in vitro capable of assembling non-lysine 48-linked polyubiquitin chains on both BRCA1-(1-639) and BARD1. When co-expressed in cells by transient transfection, the recombinant BRCA1-(1-300).BARD1 complex was found to be associated with polyubiquitin chains, suggesting that BRCA1-(1-300)*BARD1 was ubiquitinated in vivo as well. These results raise the possibility that BRCA1*BARD1 acts to assemble non-lysine 48-linked polyubiquitin chains that may serve as part of a signaling platform required for coordinating DNA repair-related events.
12080089	JunB potentiates function of BRCA1 activation domain 1 (AD1) through a coiled-coil-mediated interaction.	BRCA1 is involved in the regulation of multiple nuclear events including transcription. AD1, one of the two trans-activation domains in BRCA1, stimulates transcription in a cell context-dependent manner. Here, it is shown that BRCA1 interacts with Jun proteins via a coiled-coil motif in AD1 and the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) region of the Jun proteins. The Jun-interacting domain in BRCA1 is critical for AD1-mediated transcriptional activation. In particular, the strength of AD1 in transcriptional activation is limited by the JunB level and ectopic expression of JunB potentiates the transcriptional activity of AD1. Furthermore, JunB mRNA expression is down-regulated in many ovarian tumor tissues examined. Thus, the coiled-coil-mediated cooperation between BRCA1 and JunB may facilitate the function of these proteins in tissue-specific transcriptional regulation and tumor suppression.
12183411	Interaction of the EWS NH2 terminus with BARD1 links the Ewing's sarcoma gene to a common tumor suppressor pathway.	In 85% of Ewing family tumors, the NH2 terminus of EWS is fused to the DNA-binding domain of FLI1, an ets transcription factor. The resulting chimeric protein is a strong transcriptional activator with transforming activity. We report that EWS and EWS-FLI1 interact via their common NH2 terminus with the COOH terminus of BARD1, a putative tumor suppressor, in vitro and in vivo. Because BARD1 associates via its NH2-terminal RING domain with the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 that provides a platform for interactions with proteins involved in DNA repair and checkpoint control, our results provide a link between the Ewing's sarcoma gene product and the genome surveillance complex.
12431996	Enhancement of BRCA1 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity through direct interaction with the BARD1 protein.	The breast and ovarian cancer-specific tumor suppressor RING finger protein BRCA1 has been identified as an E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase through in vitro studies, which demonstrated that its RING finger domain can autoubiquitylate and monoubiquitylate histone H2A when supplied with Ub, E1, and UBC4 (E2). Here we report that the E3 ligase activity of the N-terminal 110 amino acid residues of BRCA1, which encodes a stable domain containing the RING finger, as well as that of the full-length BRCA1, was significantly enhanced by the BARD1 protein (residues 8-142), whose RING finger domain itself lacked Ub ligase activity in vitro. The results of mutagenesis studies indicate that the enhancement of BRCA1 E3 ligase activity by BARD1 depends on direct interaction between the two proteins. Using K48A and K63A Ub mutants, we found that BARD1 stimulated the formation of both Lys(48)- and Lys(63)-linked poly-Ub chains. However, the enhancement of BRCA1 autoubiquitylation by BARD1 mostly resulted in poly-Ub chains linked through Lys(63), which could potentially activate biological pathways other than BRCA1 degradation. We also found that co-expression of BRCA1 and BARD1 in living cells increased the abundance and stability of both proteins and that this depended on their ability to heterodimerize.
12470655	Identification of genes induced by BRCA1 in breast cancer cells.	Inherited mutations of the BRCA1 gene predispose to breast, ovarian, and other cancers. The role of the BRCA1 gene in the maintenance of chromosomal integrity is linked to a number of biological properties of its protein product, including transcriptional regulation. In the present study, we have used suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH) to identify genes induced by BRCA1 by comparing control MCF7 breast carcinoma cells (driver) with MCF7 cells ectopically expressing BRCA1 (tester) and generated a forward subtracted cDNA library. We screened 500 putative positive clones from this library. Two hundred and ten of these clones were positive by differential screening with forward and reverse subtracted probes and the 65 cDNA clones which showed more than fivefold increase were selected for sequencing analysis. We clustered 46 different genes that share high homology with sequences in the GenBank/EMBL databases. Among these, 30 were genes whose function had been previously identified while the remaining 16 clones were genes with unknown functions. Of particular interest, BRCA1 gene induces the expression of genes encoding DNA repair proteins RAD21 and MSH2, ERBB2/HER2 interacting protein ERBIN, meningioma-associated protein MAC30, and a candidate ovarian tumour-suppressor OVCA1. Northern and Western blot analyses confirmed that the expression of these five genes are up-regulated following BRCA1 overexpression in MCF7 and UBR60-bcl2 cells. This is the first study reporting a set of BRCA1-induced genes in breast carcinoma cells by the SSH technique. We suggest that some known genes identified in this study may provide new insights into the tumour-suppressor function of BRCA1.
12592385	Overexpression of a protein fragment of RNA helicase A causes inhibition of endogenous BRCA1 function and defects in ploidy and cytokinesis in mammary epithelial cells.	The breast- and ovarian-specific tumor suppressor, BRCA1, has been implicated to function in many nuclear processes, including DNA damage repair, recombination, transcription, ubiquitination, cell cycle checkpoint enforcement, and centrosome regulation. Utilizing a previously described interaction between BRCA1 and RNA helicase A (RHA), we have developed a dominant-negative approach to block BRCA1 function in human breast epithelial cells. Overexpression of a truncated RHA peptide that can bind to the BRCA1 carboxy-terminus prevents normal BRCA1 function, such as BRCA1 association with nuclear foci following DNA damage. Overexpression of this dominant-negative protein induces pleomorphic nuclei, aberrant mitoses with extra centrosomes, and tetraploidy. This model system allows us to observe changes to mammary epithelial cells that occur acutely following loss of BRCA1 function. Furthermore, inhibition of BRCA1 via overexpressing the RHA fragment coincides with a reduction in PARP-1 protein expression, suggesting a possible mechanism for BRCA1 in the maintenance of genomic integrity.
12832489	Loss of Bard1, the heterodimeric partner of the Brca1 tumor suppressor, results in early embryonic lethality and chromosomal instability.	The BRCA1 tumor suppressor has been implicated in many cellular pathways, but the mechanisms by which it suppresses tumor formation are not fully understood. In vivo BRCA1 forms a heterodimeric complex with the related BARD1 protein, and its enzymatic activity as a ubiquitin ligase is largely dependent upon its interaction with BARD1. To explore the genetic relationship between BRCA1 and BARD1, we have examined the phenotype of Bard1-null mice. These mice become developmentally retarded and die between embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) and E8.5. Embryonic lethality results from a severe impairment of cell proliferation that is not accompanied by increased apoptosis. In the absence of p53, the developmental defects associated with Bard1 deficiency are partly ameliorated, and the lethality of Bard1; p53-nullizygous mice is delayed until E9.5. This result, together with the increased chromosomal aneuploidy of Bard1 mutant cells, indicates a role for Bard1 in maintaining genomic stability. The striking similarities between the phenotypes of Bard1-null, Brca1-null, and double Bard1; Brca1-null mice provide strong genetic evidence that the developmental functions of Brca1 and Bard1 are mediated by the Brca1/Bard1 heterodimer.
14550946	Mutational analysis of BARD1 in familial breast cancer patients in Japan.	Since BRCA1,which is a breast cancer susceptibility gene, form heterodimers with BARD1, it is speculated that BARD1 mutations might affect the function of BRCA1, contributing to breast carcinogenesis. Thus, in the present study, we have conducted mutational analysis of BARD1 in familial breast cancer patients (n=60) who were tested negative for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations. We have been unable to show any clearly deleterious mutations but identified four missence mutations (Ser/Cys 241, Arg/Ser 378, Asn/Ser 470, Val/Met 507), one silent mutation (His/His 506), and one frameshift (in-frame) mutation (1139del21bp). Of these six mutations, one (Asn/Ser 470) was considered as a putative germline mutation since such a mutation was not observed in any of the healthy controls (n=152) but the other five mutations were considered as common genetic polymorphisms since they were frequently observed in the healthy controls. These genetic polymorphisms were further analyzed in their association with breast cancer risk by a case-control study using the population-based breast cancers (n=143) and healthy controls (n=155), which showed that carriers of the variant allele Met at codon 507 are significantly associated with the increased risk of breast cancer (adjusted odds ratio=2.05, 95% confidential interval=1.01-4.16) in postmenopausal women and that the other genetic polymorphisms are not associated with breast cancer risk. These results suggest that BARD1 mutations are responsible for, if any, a very small number of familial breast cancers. Genetic polymorphism of BARD1 (Val/Met 507) could be useful in the selection of postmenopausal women at a high risk for developing breast cancer.
7564468	Characteristic biological features of human megakaryoblastic leukaemia cell lines.	Both normal and leukaemic human megakaryocytopoiesis are stimulated by several cytokines, including stem cell factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3, GM-CSF/interleukin-3 fusion protein, interleukin-6, interleukin-11, basic fibroblast growth factor and thrombopoietin, but are inhibited by tumour necrosis factor-alpha, platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin, thrombin, interleukin-4, interferon-alpha and interferon-gamma. Human megakaryoblastic leukaemia cell lines have common biological features, including high expression of the megakaryocytic specific antigen: CD41; high expression of the early myeloid antigens: CD34 and CD33; constitutive expression of interleukin-6 and platelet-derived growth factor; complex karyotype picture; expression of c-kit: the stem cell factor receptor; growth-dependency or -stimulation by stem cell factor, interleukin-3 and/or GM-CSF; megakaryoblastic differentiation by phorbol-myristate-acetate; and in vivo tumorigenicity in mice is associated with marked fibrosis. Only a few agents including phorbol-myristate-acetate; vitamin D3, interferon-alpha, interferon-beta 2, erythropoietin and thrombin have been reported to induce megakaryocytic differentiation in the human megakaryoblastic leukaemia cells.
7929128	Characterization of the oligodeoxynucleotide-mediated inhibition of interferon-gamma-induced major histocompatibility complex class I and intercellular adhesion molecule-1.	The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I and II genes and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) are regulated by interferon-gamma in a variety of cell types. We have previously shown that the oligodeoxynucleotide 5'-GGG GTT GGT TGT GTT GGG TGT TGT GT-RNH2 (oligo I) inhibits the interferon-gamma-mediated enhancement of MHC Class I and ICAM-1 proteins in the K562 cell line. We have now investigated the mechanism of action of oligo I and report that it acts by inhibiting the binding of interferon-gamma to cells. We also show that the dose-response curves, the selectivity profile, and the kinetics of oligo I are consistent with this novel mechanism of action. The dose-response curves for oligo I, obtained using antibodies against the MHC Class I heavy chain, beta 2-microglobulin, or ICAM-1, are almost superimposable at each observation time. MHC Class I induction by 6400 units/ml interferon-alpha or interferon-beta or ICAM-1 enhancement by 800 units/ml tumor necrosis factor-alpha is not inhibited by oligo I. However, the synergistic induction of MHC Class I by mixtures of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma is inhibited. Oligo I belongs to a class of active oligodeoxynucleotides that inhibits interferon-gamma-induced MHC Class I and ICAM-1 in K562 cells. The activity and potency is sequence-dependent, but remarkably different sequences can have comparable effects. The activity of oligo I in the HeLa S3 cell line inhibits the interferon-gamma-mediated enhancement of both ICAM-1 and MHC Class II DR and the interferon-gamma-mediated reduction in transferrin receptor expression. Thus, oligo I appears to specifically inhibit interferon-gamma-induced changes in protein expression, which is consistent with oligo I acting at an early step(s) in the induction process. Taken together, our results show that oligo I exerts its effects by inhibiting the association of interferon-gamma with the cell surface, which is a novel mechanism of action for oligodeoxynucleotides.
9342365	Cell cycle-dependent colocalization of BARD1 and BRCA1 proteins in discrete nuclear domains.	"Germ-line mutations of the BRCA1 gene predispose women to early-onset breast and ovarian cancer by compromising the gene's presumptive function as a tumor suppressor. Although the biochemical properties of BRCA1 polypeptides are not understood, their expression pattern and subcellular localization suggest a role in cell-cycle regulation. When resting cells are induced to proliferate, the steady-state levels of BRCA1 increase in late G1 and reach a maximum during S phase. Moreover, in S phase cells, BRCA1 polypeptides are hyperphosphorylated and accumulate into discrete subnuclear foci termed ""BRCA1 nuclear dots."" BRCA1 associates in vivo with a structurally related protein termed BARD1. Here we show that the steady-state levels of BARD1, unlike those of BRCA1, remain relatively constant during cell cycle progression. However, immunostaining revealed that BARD1 resides within BRCA1 nuclear dots during S phase of the cell cycle, but not during the G1 phase. Nevertheless, BARD1 polypeptides are found exclusively in the nuclear fractions of both G1- and S-phase cells. Therefore, progression to S phase is accompanied by the aggregation of nuclear BARD1 polypeptides into BRCA1 nuclear dots. This cell cycle-dependent colocalization of BARD1 and BRCA1 indicates a role for BARD1 in BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression."
9425226	Mutations in the BRCA1-associated RING domain (BARD1) gene in primary breast, ovarian and uterine cancers.	Germline alterations of BRCA1 result in susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. The protein encoded by BRCA1 interacts in vivo with the BRCA1-associated RING domain (BARD1) protein. Accordingly, BARD1 is likely to be a critical factor in BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression and may also serve as a target for tumorigenic lesions in some human cancers. We have now determined the genomic structure of BARD1 and performed a mutational analysis of 58 ovarian tumors, 50 breast tumors and 60 uterine tumors. Seven polymorphisms were detected within the 2.34 kb coding sequence of BARD1 . Somatically acquired missense mutations were observed in one breast carcinoma and one endometrial tumor; in at least one of these cases, tumor formation was accompanied by loss of the wild-type BARD1 allele, following the paradigm for known tumor suppressor genes. In addition, a germline alteration of BARD1 was identified in a clear cell ovarian tumor (Gln564His); again, loss of the wild-type BARD1 allele was observed in the malignant cells of this patient. The Gln564His patient was also diagnosed with two other primary cancers: a synchronous lobular breast carcinoma and a stage IA clear cell endometrioid cancer confined to an endometrial polyp 6 years earlier. These findings suggest an occasional role for BARD1 mutations in the development of sporadic and hereditary tumors.
9679765	Down-regulation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in human ovarian cancer cells exposed to adriamycin and ultraviolet radiation.	Germ-line mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes predispose women to develop cancers of the breast and ovary, but the biologic functions of these genes remains unclear. We have investigated the responses of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene products to cytotoxic agents in 3 human ovarian cancer cell lines: SK-OV-3 (which contains a p53 deletion mutation), CAOV-3 (which over-expresses a mutant p53) and PA-1 (which expresses wild-type p53). In screening studies, we determined the effects of 7 different agents on BRCA1 and BRCA2 expression. We found that Adriamycin (ADR) and ultraviolet (UV)radiation significantly down-regulated BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNA expression in SK-OV-3 cells. On the other hand, camptothecin, nitrogen mustard, taxol, vincristine and etoposide had no effect on BRCA1 or BRCA2 mRNA levels at doses that yielded degrees of cytotoxicity similar to or greater than ADR. The down-regulation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNAs was dose and time dependent; significant down-regulation was first observed at 8-16 hr after exposure to ADR. BRCA1 protein levels were also down-regulated following treatment of SK-OV-3 cells with ADR. Similar results were observed in CAOV-3 and PA-1 cells treated with ADR, and this finding could not be directly attributed to ADR-induced changes in the cell cycle distribution. The ADR doses required for significant decreases of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were about 10-15, 5-10 and 2 microM, respectively, for SK-OV-3, CAOV-3 and PA-1; the IC50 doses for loss of cell viability (determined by Trypan blue dye exclusion) were 23, 14 and 0.4 microM, respectively. Thus, at equitoxic doses of ADR, PA-1 cells were more resistant to down-regulation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 than SK-OV-3 or CAOV-3. Our findings suggest that 1) BRCA1 and BRCA2 expression in human ovarian cancer cell lines is selectively down-regulated by 2 DNA-damaging agents (ADR and UV radiation); 2) these responses are not due to non-specific cytotoxicity; and 3) the BRCA1 and BRCA2 responses may be dependent, in part, on the p53 functional status of the cells. We speculate that the down-regulation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 may be part of a cellular survival response activated by certain forms of DNA damage.
10477523	Functional interaction of BRCA1-associated BARD1 with polyadenylation factor CstF-50.	Polyadenylation of messenger RNA precursors requires a complex protein machinery that is closely integrated with the even more complex transcriptional apparatus. Here a polyadenylation factor, CstF-50 (cleavage stimulation factor), is shown to interact in vitro and in intact cells with a nuclear protein of previously unknown function, BRCA1-associated RING domain protein (BARD1). The BARD1-CstF-50 interaction inhibits polyadenylation in vitro. BARD1, like CstF-50, also interacts with RNA polymerase II. These results indicate that BARD1-mediated inhibition of polyadenylation may prevent inappropriate RNA processing during transcription, perhaps at sites of DNA repair, and they reveal an unanticipated integration of diverse nuclear events.
10918303	Roles of BRCA1 and its interacting proteins.	Germline mutations of BRCA1 predispose women to breast and ovarian cancers. BRCA1 contains several functional domains that interact directly or indirectly with a variety of molecules, including tumor suppressors (p53, RB, BRCA2 and ATM), oncogenes (c-Myc, casein kinase II and E2F), DNA damage repair proteins (RAD50 and RAD51), cell-cycle regulators (cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases), transcriptional activators and repressors (RNA polymerase II, RHA, histone deacetylase complex and CtIP) and others. Mounting evidence indicates that these physical associations are not artifacts; rather, BRCA1 is likely to serve as an important central component in multiple biological pathways that regulate cell-cycle progression, centrosome duplication, DNA damage repair, cell growth and apoptosis, and transcriptional activation and repression. This review examines our understanding of the significance of the interactions between BRCA1 and other proteins, through which BRCA1 maintains genome integrity and represses tumor formation.

11156388	Identification of an apoptotic cleavage product of BARD1 as an autoantigen: a potential factor in the antitumoral response mediated by apoptotic bodies.	We have shown previously that rats can be cured from induced peritoneal colon carcinomatosis by injections of apoptotic bodies derived from tumor cells and interleukin 2. This curative treatment generated a tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cell response associated with a humoral response. Autoantibodies from sera of cured rats strongly recognized a Mr 67,000 protein from apoptotic bodies and weakly reacted with a protein of Mr approximately 97,000 in PROb parental cells. We now show that these autoantibodies are directed against BARD1, originally identified as a protein interacting with the product of the breast cancer gene 1, BRCA1. We demonstrate that the Mr 67,000 antigen is a cleaved form of BARD1 present in apoptotic bodies derived from rat and human colon and mammary carcinoma cell lines. Moreover, we show that the cleavage site of BARD1 is located NH2 terminally but downstream of the RING domain essential for BARD1 and BRCA1 protein interaction. In vitro studies using [35S]methionine-labeled human BARD1 and apoptotic cellular extracts derived from SW48 carcinoma cells indicate that BARD1 proteolysis occurs at an early stage of apoptosis and in a cell cycle-dependent manner. This hydrolysis is inhibited by EGTA, and the calpain inhibitor I, N-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal, but not by several caspases inhibitors, suggesting that BARD1 is hydrolyzed by the calcium-dependent cysteine proteases, calpains. Thus, the highly immunogenic form of cleaved BARD1 could contribute to the antitumoral response mediated by apoptotic bodies.
11257228	The BARD1-CstF-50 interaction links mRNA 3' end formation to DNA damage and tumor suppression.	The mRNA polyadenylation factor CstF interacts with the BRCA1-associated protein BARD1, and this interaction represses the nuclear mRNA polyadenylation machinery in vitro. Given the suspected role of BRCA1/BARD1 in DNA repair, we tested whether inhibition of mRNA processing is linked to DNA damage. Strikingly, we found that 3' cleavage in extracts from cells treated with hydroxyurea or ultraviolet light was strongly, but transiently, inhibited. Although no changes were detected in CstF, BARD1, and BRCA1 protein levels, increased amounts of a CstF/BARD1/BRCA1 complex were detected. Supporting the physiological significance of these results, a previously identified tumor-associated germline mutation in BARD1 (Gln564His) reduced binding to CstF and abrogated inhibition of polyadenylation. Together these results indicate a link between mRNA 3' processing and DNA repair and tumor suppression.
11807980	Germline mutations of the BRCA1-associated ring domain (BARD1) gene in breast and breast/ovarian families negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2 alterations.	BARD1 (BRCA1-associated RING domain) was identified by yeast two-hybrid screening as a protein interacting with BRCA1. Somatic and germline mutations of BARD1 have been detected in sporadic breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers. The present study represents the first description of BARD1 germline mutations in hereditary breast and breast/ovarian cancer patients. We analyzed the BARD1 gene in 40 families with hereditary breast and breast/ovarian cancer, tested negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. A mutational analysis by PCR-SSCP on the coding region and the exon-intron splice boundaries of the BARD1 gene yielded four different germline mutations. A group of 20 patients diagnosed with sporadic breast cancer below the age of 40 was also examined and only one germline mutation was found. A study of loss of heterozygosity at the BARD1 locus in neoplastic tissues from patients with BARD1 germline mutations was carried out. In all cases, we were unable to find any evidence for allelic deletions. The involvement of BARD1 mutations in the susceptibility to hereditary breast and breast/ovarian cancer is discussed.
11925436	BARD1 induces BRCA1 intranuclear foci formation by increasing RING-dependent BRCA1 nuclear import and inhibiting BRCA1 nuclear export.	BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor with several important nuclear functions. BRCA1 has no known cytoplasmic functions. We show here that the two previously identified nuclear localization signals (NLSs) are insufficient for nuclear localization of BRCA1 due to the opposing action of an NH2-terminal nuclear export signal. In transfected breast cancer cells, BRCA1 nuclear localization requires both the NLSs and NH2-terminal RING domain region; mutating either of these sequences shifts BRCA1 to the cytoplasm. The BRCA1 RING element mediates nuclear import via association with BARD1, and this is not affected by cancer-associated RING mutations. Moreover, BARD1 directly masks the BRCA1 nuclear export signal, and the resulting block to nuclear export is requisite for efficient import and nuclear localization of ectopic and endogenous BRCA1. Our results explain why BRCA1 exon 11 splice variants, which lack the NLSs but retain the RING domain, are frequently detected in the nucleus and in nuclear foci in vivo. In fact, co-expression of BARD1 promoted formation of DNA damage-induced nuclear foci comprising ectopic wild-type or NLS-deficient BRCA1, implicating BARD1 in nuclear targeting of BRCA1 for DNA repair. Our identification of BARD1 as a BRCA1 nuclear chaperone has regulatory implications for its reported effects on BRCA1 protein stability, ubiquitin ligase activity, and DNA repair.
12559046	Regulation of BRCA1 expression and its relationship to sporadic breast cancer.	Germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 tumour suppressor gene contribute to familial breast tumour formation, but there is no evidence for direct mutation of the BRCA1 gene in the sporadic form of the disease. In contrast, decreased expression of the BRCA1 gene has been shown to be common in sporadic tumours, and the magnitude of the decrease correlates with disease progression. BRCA1 expression is also tightly regulated during normal breast development. Determining how these developmental regulators of BRCA1 expression are co-opted during breast tumourigenesis could lead to a better understanding of sporadic breast cancer aetiology and the generation of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing sporadic breast tumour progression.
9645467	Staurosporine-sensitive protein phosphorylation is required for postreplication DNA repair in human cells.	DNA repair is an important factor of stability of pro- and eukaryotic genomes which plays a central role in mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. Genetic control of nucleotide excision repair (NER) in mammalian cells is well studied, but little is known about molecular mechanisms of postreplication repair (PRR) which allows bypass of base lesions in template strands after DNA replication. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae PRR is controlled by the RAD61RAD18 pathway which involves POL30 gene encoding proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and in human cells PCNA is known to be closely associated with the newly replicated chromatin where PRR probably takes place. In UV-irradiated human cells distinct PCNA foci may be detected in some cells which accumulate phosphorylated breast cancer susceptibility protein BRCA1 and another protein BARD1. Human PCNA is also known to be phosphorylated after UV-irradiation. In this study we found that the known inhibitor of protein kinases staurosporine supresses PRR in NER-deficient cells which is consistent with the view that BRCA1 and PCNA are required for PRR. We also have shown that the distinct PCNA foci in UV-irradiated NER-deficient cells are actually associated with the newly replicated chromatin. Since RAD18 protein is not essential for normal DNA replication and directly controls PRR in yeast, we analysed whether this protein as well as its human homologs (HR18A and HR18B) have common domains with BRCA1 and BARD1. It is found that HR18A has a subregion of homology to BARD1 and HR18A-to BRCA1. Taken together the results indicate that BRCA1 and BARD1 may be involved in PRR in human cells.
11410366	Sequence, chromosomal location and expression analysis of the murine homologue of human RAD51L2/RAD51C.	The Rad51 protein has been shown to play a vital role in the DNA repair process. In humans, its interaction with proteins like BRCA1 and BRCA2 has provided an insight into the mechanism of how these molecules function as tumor suppressors. Several members of the Rad51-like family have been recently identified, including RAD51L2. This gene has been found to be amplified in breast tumors suggesting its role in tumor progression. Here, we describe the cloning of the murine homologue of the human RAD51L2/RAD51C gene. Sequence analysis has revealed that the murine Rad51l2 protein is 86% identical and 93% similar to its human homologue. In spite of such high sequence conservation, the murine protein lacks the first nine amino acids present in the human protein. We have cloned and confirmed the sequence of the 5' end of the murine Rad51l2 cDNA using 5' RACE technique as well as by sequencing the genomic region flanking the first exon of the murine Rad51l2 gene. Northern analysis shows that Rad51l2 is expressed in several adult tissues as well as in embryos at various developmental stages. The murine Rad51l2 gene maps to chromosome 11 and is located in the syntenic region of human chromosome 17q22-23, where the human RAD51L2 is present.
11593018	Functional communication between endogenous BRCA1 and its partner, BARD1, during Xenopus laevis development.	The breast and ovarian susceptibility protein 1 (BRCA1) heterodimerizes with its structural relative, the BRCA1-associated RING domain protein (BARD1), which may have tumor suppressing function in its own right. Both proteins have evolved from a common evolutionary ancestor, and both exist in Xenopus laevis where, similar to their mammalian homologs, they form functional heterodimers. Depleting frog embryos of either BARD1 or BRCA1 led to similar and widely defective developmental phenotypes as well as depletion of the other polypeptide due to its decreased stability. Thus, each protein, in part, controls the abundance, stability, and function of the other, and these effects are heterodimerization-dependent. The interdependent nature of BRCA1 and BARD1 function supports the view that BARD1/BRCA1 heterodimers play a major role in breast and ovarian cancer suppression.
11879553	Distinct functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in double-strand break repair.	Individuals carrying BRCA mutations are predisposed to breast cancer. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are required for homologous recombination and DNA break repair, leading to the suggestion that they act in concert. However, direct evidence of a stable BRCA1/BRCA2 complex has not been demonstrated. Rather, the two proteins have been found as constituents of discrete, but perhaps nonexclusive complexes that are critical for repair. We discuss the interaction of BRCA1 with the BACH1 and BARD1 proteins, and suggest that the pleiotropic nature of mutations in BRCA1 may be associated with defects in protein--protein interactions. In contrast, the role of BRCA2 in DNA repair may be more defined by its direct interaction with the RAD51 recombinase.
11943588	BRCA1-dependent and independent functions of BARD1.	Breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1)-associated RING domain (BARD1) was discovered as a protein interacting with the RING domain of BRCA1. It is structurally homologous to BRCA1 with which it shares the conserved RING finger and BRCT domains. BARD1 is strongly expressed in spleen and testis, correlated with the expression of BRCA1. Co-localization of BARD1 with BRCA1 and other repair proteins indicate a function in DNA repair. A potential role of BARD1-BRCA1 complexes in ubiquitination of RNA Pol II, and the interaction of BARD1 with polyadenylation factor CstF-50, thus inhibiting mRNA processing, provide mechanisms for tumor suppression. BRCA1-independent functions of BARD1 were first noted by its inordinate expression in hormonally regulated uterine tissue. BARD1 repression lead to a premalignant phenotype in mammary gland epithelial cells. The interaction of BARD1 with NF-kappaB, suggests modulation of transcriptional activity independent of BRCA1. Elevated BARD1 expression in apoptotic tumor cells was found associated with anti-BARD1 immune response thus leading to new therapeutic approaches.
12024016	Constitutive association of BRCA1 and c-Abl and its ATM-dependent disruption after irradiation.	BRCA1 plays an important role in mechanisms of response to double-strand breaks, participating in genome surveillance, DNA repair, and cell cycle checkpoint arrests. Here, we identify a constitutive BRCA1-c-Abl complex and provide evidence for a direct interaction between the PXXP motif in the C terminus of BRCA1 and the SH3 domain of c-Abl. Following exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), the BRCA1-c-Abl complex is disrupted in an ATM-dependent manner, which correlates temporally with ATM-dependent phosphorylation of BRCA1 and ATM-dependent enhancement of the tyrosine kinase activity of c-Abl. The BRCA1-c-Abl interaction is affected by radiation-induced modification to both BRCA1 and c-Abl. We show that the C terminus of BRCA1 is phosphorylated by c-Abl in vitro. In vivo, BRCA1 is phosphorylated at tyrosine residues in an ATM-dependent, radiation-dependent manner. Tyrosine phosphorylation of BRCA1, however, is not required for the disruption of the BRCA1-c-Abl complex. BRCA1-mutated cells exhibit constitutively high c-Abl kinase activity that is not further increased on exposure to IR. We suggest a model in which BRCA1 acts in concert with ATM to regulate c-Abl tyrosine kinase activity.
12154023	The BRCA1 and BARD1 association with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme.	We have previously shown that endogenous BRCA1 and overexpressed epitope-tagged BRCA1 are present in the transcription complex called the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (holo-pol). In this study, we further characterized BRCA1 association with the holo-pol by overexpressing deletion mutants of epitope-tagged BRCA1. We found that BRCA1-associated RING domain protein (BARD1) is a component of the holo-pol complex. Deletion of the BRCA1 NH(2) terminus, which is bound by BARD1 as well as other proteins, eliminates >98% of BRCA1 association with the holo-pol. In contrast with earlier observations, deletion of the COOH terminus of BRCA1 did not affect significantly the association with holo-pol. Immunocytochemistry of expressed full-length and deletion mutants of BRCA1 showed that the NH(2) terminus of BRCA1 is important for nuclear dot formation in S-phase. An intact BRCA1 NH(2) terminus is required for the association with holo-pol and for subnuclear localization in S-phase foci. Taken together, these data support a role for BRCA1 regulation of holo-pol function.
9133444	Developmental expression of Brca2 colocalizes with Brca1 and is associated with proliferation and differentiation in multiple tissues.	Germline mutations in the putative tumor suppressor gene, BRCA1, predispose women to dramatically elevated risks of breast cancer, while germline mutations in the structurally unrelated gene, BRCA2, predispose both men and women to breast cancer. Recent studies have suggested an important developmental role for the murine homologue of BRCA1 in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation. At the present time, however, little is known about the developmental role of BRCA2 or the regulation of its expression in vivo. We have determined the spatial and temporal pattern of expression of the murine homologue of BRCA2 during fetal development, in adult tissues, and in the mammary gland during postnatal development. Our results indicate that Brca2 mRNA expression is highest in proliferating cellular compartments, particularly those undergoing differentiation. In the breast, Brca2 expression is developmentally regulated and is induced during puberty and pregnancy and as a result of parity. Surprisingly, in multiple fetal and adult tissues the spatial and temporal pattern of Brca2 mRNA expression is virtually indistinguishable from that of Brca1, despite the fact that these genes display no homology. These observations suggest that Brca2 is involved in the processes of proliferation and differentiation in the mammary gland and other tissues, and that Brca1 and Brca2 mRNA expression may be regulated by similar pathways and stimuli in multiple cell types. Interestingly, however, our analysis reveals that Brca1 and Brca2 expression are differentially regulated during the development of specific endocrine target tissues, such as the testis during spermatogenesis and the breast during pregnancy. In addition, the ratio of mRNA expression in the mammary glands of adult females relative to adult males is significantly greater for Brca1 than for Brca2. These observations imply that Brca1 and Brca2 mRNA expression are differentially regulated by sex hormones. In order to test this hypothesis, we have analyzed the expression of these two breast cancer susceptibility genes in ovariectomized mice treated with 17beta-estradiol and progesterone. Our results demonstrate that the up-regulation of mRNA expression in the breast by ovarian hormones is significantly greater for Brca1 than for Brca2. These observations suggest that the gender-specific differences in phenotype associated with germline mutations in BRCA2 versus BRCA1 may be related to the differential regulation of these genes by sex hormones.
10195418	The functions of breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) product and its associated proteins.	About half of the familial breast cancer cases are found to bear mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1). The majority of BRCA1 mutations produce a truncated protein and BRCA1-associated breast tumors exhibit a number of defined tumor phenotypes. The function of BRCA1 has been examined in gene knockout mice in which the nullizygous mice die early in utero, but this lethality can be partially rescued by a nullizygous p53 mutation. Wild-type BRCA1 protein binds to a number of cellular proteins, including DNA repair protein Rad51, tumor suppressor p53, RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, RNA helicase A, CtBP-interacting protein, c-myc, BRCA1-associated RING domain protein (BARD1), BRCA2 protein, etc. These proteins likely mediate the involvement of BRCA1 in DNA repair, transcriptional transactivation, and cell cycle control. Overall, BRCA1 protein may act as a converging vehicle for cell regulatory proteins to associate with. Therefore, mutations in BRCA1 may affect the composition of these complexes on which dysregulation of cellular functions with eventual development of malignancy is expected.
10959425	Repression of the putative tumor suppressor gene Bard1 or expression of Notch4(int-3) oncogene subvert the morphogenetic properties of mammary epithelial cells.	We have investigated whether repression of the putative tumor suppressor gene BARD1 or expression of the Notch4(int-3) oncogene in non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells affects their in vitro morphogenetic properties. Bard1 (Brca1-associated ring domain) is a protein interacting with Brca1 and thought to be involved in Brca1-mediated tumor suppression. To investigate the potential role of Bard1 in mammary gland development, we repressed its expression in TAC-2 cells, a murine mammary epithelial cell line which, when grown in three-dimensional collagen gels, forms branching ducts in response to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and alveolar-like cysts in response to hydrocortisone. Whereas Bard1 repression did not markedly modify the tubulogenic response of TAC-2 cells to HGF, it dramatically altered cyst development, resulting in the formation of compact cell aggregates devoid of central lumen. In addition, when grown to post-confluence in two-dimensional cultures, Bard1-suppressed TAC-2 cells overcame contact-inhibition of cell proliferation and formed multiple cell layers. The Notch4(int-3) oncogene, which codes for a constitutively activated form of the Notch4 receptor, has been reported to induce undifferentiated carcinomas when expressed in the mammary gland. The potential effect of activated Notch4 on mammary gland morphogenesis was investigated by retroviral expression of the oncogene in TAC-2 cells. Notch4(int-3) expression was found to significantly reduce HGF-induced tubulogenesis and to markedly inhibit hydrocortisone-induced cyst formation. In addition, Notch4(int-3) expressing TAC-2 cells formed multilayers in post-confluent cultures and exhibited an invasive behavior when grown on the surface of collagen gels. Taken together, these results indicate that both repression of Bard1 and expression of Notch4(int-3) disrupt cyst morphogenesis and induce an invasive phenotype in TAC-2 mammary epithelial cells.
11712283	Atrioventricular pressure half-time. Measure of mitral valve orifice area.	In 20 patients studied by cardiac catheterization, the time required for the diastolic left atrioventricular pressure difference to fall to half its initial value (half-time) varied with the anatomic severity of the valvular stenosis. In mild mitral stenosis, the half-time was approximately 100 msec; in moderate stenosis, it was about 200 msec; and it was 300 msec or longer in severe stenosis. The half-time at the nonstenotic mitral valve was less than 25 msec. Although exercise increased the atrioventricular pressure gradient, heart rate, and cardiac output significantly, the half-time was affected only slightly. Mitral regurgitation of various severities did not affect the half-time. The half-time appears to vary inversely with the anatomic orifice area of the mitral valve. The determination of the half-time obviates the need for the commonly used exercise test for the evaluation of mitral stenosis.
11712286	Studies on coumarin anticoagulant drugs. Initiation of warfarin therapy without a loading dose.	Thirty normal subjects were given a single loading dose of warfarin sodium, 1.5 mg/kg of body weight. The drug was metabolized slowly (mean biological half-life, 47 hr) and showed a prolonged biological effect (over 6 days). In two separate experiments no loading dose was given; instead, daily doses of 15 mg and 10 mg were administered to 15 of the subjects. The prothrombin complex responses were compared with those obtained in the same subjects after the large loading dose. The mean time in days to reach the therapeutic range (prothrombin complex activity < 35% of normal) was 1.1 days with the dose of 1.5 mg/kg of body weight, 2.7 days with the dose of 15 mg/day, and 5.2 days with 10 mg/day. With all three methods the therapeutic range was reached soon after a level of warfarin of 2 mg/L plasma was attained. The rates of fall of the four vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X) with the large loading dose and with the daily dosage of 15 mg were compared in six of the subjects. With the loading dose, factor VII activity was less during the first 48 hr, but there was no other significant difference between the two methods of drug administration in the amount of reduction of any of the four factors. Since the role of factor VII in thrombogenesis is questioned, these results provide a rational basis for the induction of prophylactic anticoagulant therapy without large loading doses of warfarin. Avoidance of the customary loading dose should reduce the danger of hemorrhage, particularly in patients who are sensitive to the drug because of advanced age, sepsis, liver disease, congestive heart failure, or recent surgery or trauma.
12890688	The BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer assembles polyubiquitin chains through an unconventional linkage involving lysine residue K6 of ubiquitin.	The BRCA1 tumor suppressor forms a heterodimer with the BARD1 protein, and the resulting complex functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes the synthesis of polyubiquitin chains. In theory, polyubiquitination can occur by isopeptide bond formation at any of the seven lysine residues of ubiquitin. The isopeptide linkage of a polyubiquitin chain is a particularly important determinant of its cellular function, such that K48-linked chains commonly target proteins for proteasomal degradation, while K63 chains serve non-proteolytic roles in various signaling pathways. To determine the isopeptide linkage formed by BRCA1/BARD1-dependent polyubiquitination, we purified a full-length heterodimeric complex and compared its linkage specificity with that of E6-AP, an E3 ligase known to induce proteolysis of its cellular substrates. Using a comprehensive mutation analysis, we found that E6-AP catalyzes the synthesis of K48-linked polyubiquitin chains. In contrast, however, the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer directs polymerization of ubiquitin primarily through an unconventional linkage involving lysine residue K6. Although heterologous substrates of BRCA1/BARD1 are not known, BRCA1 autoubiquitination occurs principally by conjugation with K6-linked polymers. The ability of BRCA1/BARD1 to form K6-linked polyubiquitin chains suggests that it may impart unique cellular properties to its natural enzymatic substrates.
14560035	BARD1 participates with BRCA1 in homology-directed repair of chromosome breaks.	The BRCA1 tumor suppressor has been implicated in the maintenance of chromosomal stability through homology-directed repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Much of the BRCA1 in cells forms a heterodimeric complex with a structurally related protein BARD1. We report that expression of truncated mouse or human BARD1 peptides capable of interacting with Brca1 results in a homologous-repair deficiency. Repair is mildly reduced in Brca1 wild-type cells and severely reduced in cells that harbor a Brca1 splice product deleted for exon 11. Nuclear localization of the Brca1 or BARD1 peptides is not compromised, implying that the repair deficiency is caused by a more direct effect on repair. The tumor suppressor activity of BRCA1 may require the participation of BARD1 to maintain chromosome integrity through the homologous-repair pathway.
8080686	Oestrogen-regulated genes in breast cancer: association of pLIV1 with lymph node involvement.	In order to isolate markers of oestrogen responsiveness in breast cancer, we have cloned a number of oestrogen-regulated genes. Two of these, pLIV1 and pLIV2 (pS2), have been shown to be predominantly expressed in oestrogen receptor (ER)+ tumours. In this study, we examined their expression in relation to various clinical and histopathological features of breast cancer, and showed that pLIV1, but not pS2, is significantly associated with lymph node involvement (P < 0.01), while pS2 is more frequently observed in premenopausal patients (P < 0.05). Subdivision of the pLIV1 data by ER and nodal status of the tumour identified a highly significant association between pLIV1 expression and lymph node involvement in ER-positive disease, with 15/24 (63%) ER+ pLIV1+ tumours showing nodal involvement. Conversely, 20/23 (87%) ER+ pLIV1- patients were lymph node-negative (P < 0.001). Subdivision of the pS2 data by ER status did not reach significance. The application of pLIV1 as a marker of lymph node involvement was further exemplified in small tumours (< < 2 cm), where 11/12 (92%) lymph node-positive patients expressed pLIV1, while 17/22 (77%) node-negative patients were pLIV1 negative (P < 0.001). Similarly, pLIV1 expression identified lymph node involvement in moderately differentiated tumours (P < 0.01), but was independent of vascular invasion. pLIV1 may, therefore, represent a candidate gene for metastatic spread in ER+ breast cancer.
8541881	Inherited breast and ovarian cancer.	An estimated 5 to 10% of all breast and ovarian cancer is attributable to inherited mutations in two highly penetrant autosomal dominant susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. BRCA1 confers higher risk of ovarian cancer and BRCA2 much higher risk of male breast cancer. With the exception of missense mutations in the RING finger near the amino terminus of BRCA1, virtually all germline mutations in the gene cause the novel BRCA1 protein to be prematurely truncated. Approximately 90% of breast tumors in BRCA1 families, 50% of unselected breast tumors and 65-80% of unselected ovarian tumors have lost one allele of BRCA1 by somatic deletion. Very few tumors have detectable somatic point mutations in BRCA1. Inhibition of BRCA1 expression in mammary epithelial cell lines also suggests that BRCA1 may act as a tumor suppressor. The biological function of BRCA1 is still unknown, although identification of a patient homozygous for an inherited BRCA1 mutation suggests that the gene's function may be essential only to specific tissues. At least two other genes, P53 and the androgen receptor, are responsible for inherited predisposition to breast cancer in rare families. Several epidemiologic studies suggest that individuals carrying rare alleles at a minisatellite flanking the HRAS locus are at increased risk of cancer, including breast cancer. Finally, preliminary epidemiologic studies also suggest that individuals heterozygous for mutations in the ataxia telangiectasia gene may be at increased risk of breast cancer.
8944023	Identification of a RING protein that can interact in vivo with the BRCA1 gene product.	The hereditary breast and ovarian cancer gene, BRCA1, encodes a large polypeptide that contains the cysteine-rich RING motif, a zinc-binding domain found in a variety of regulatory proteins. Here we describe a novel protein that interacts in vivo with the N-terminal region of BRCA1. This BRCA1-associated RING domain (BARD1) protein contains an N-terminal RING motif, three tandem ankyrin repeats, and a C-terminal sequence with significant homology to the phylogenetically conserved BRCT domains that lie near the C terminus of BRCA1. The BARD1/BRCA1 interaction is disrupted by BRCA1 missense mutations that segregate with breast cancer susceptibility, indicating that BARD1 may be involved in mediating tumour suppression by BRCA1.
8986808	HMG I(Y) interferes with the DNA binding of NF-AT factors and the induction of the interleukin 4 promoter in T cells.	HMG I(Y) proteins bind to double-stranded A + T oligonucleotides longer than three base pairs. Such motifs form part of numerous NF-AT-binding sites of lymphokine promoters, including the interleukin 4 (IL-4) promoter. NF-AT factors share short homologous peptide sequences in their DNA-binding domain with NF-kappa B factors and bind to certain NF-kappa B sites. It has been shown that HMG I(Y) proteins enhance NF-kappa B binding to the interferon beta promoter and virus-mediated interferon beta promoter induction. We show that HMG I(Y) proteins exert an opposite effect on the DNA binding of NF-AT factors and the induction of the IL-4 promoter in T lymphocytes. Introduction of mutations into a high-affinity HMG I(Y)-binding site of the IL-4 promoter, which decreased HMG I(Y)-binding to a NF-AT-binding sequence, the Pu-bB (or P) site, distinctly increased the induction of the IL-4 promoter in Jurkat T leukemia cells. High concentrations of HMG I(Y) proteins are able to displace NF-ATp from its binding to the Pu-bB site. High HMG I(Y) concentrations are typical for Jurkat cells and peripheral blood T lymphocytes, whereas E14 T lymphoma cells and certain T helper type 2 cell clones contain relatively low HMG I(Y) concentrations. Our results indicate that HMG I(Y) proteins do not cooperate, but instead compete with NF-AT factors for the binding to DNA even though NF-AT factors share some DNA-binding to DNA even though NF-AT factors share some DNA-binding properties with NF-kB factors. This competition between HMG I(Y) and NF-AT proteins for DNA binding might be due to common contacts with minor groove nucleotides of DNA and may be one mechanism contributing to the selective IL-4 expression in certain T lymphocyte populations, such as T helper type 2 cells.
11712287	Analysis of T-wave abnormalities associated with myocardial infarction using a theoretic model.	The physiological basis of serial T-wave abnormalities associated with myocardial infarction was studied. After coronary artery ligation in dogs, ventricular functional refractory periods (FRPs) were measured at five to eight epicardial, intramural, and endocardial sites. FRPs measured during acute ischemia shortened an average of 26 msec. FRPs measured 24 to 72 hr after coronary ligation were 24 msec longer at ischemic than at nonischemic sites. Alterations of recovery times were analyzed in terms of a repolarization model which related the form of the action potential downstroke to the form of the T wave of the body surface ECG. Observed FRPs were used to infer action potential duration and T waves were derived. Shortening FRPs in the anterolateral wall of the ventricle increased the amplitude of derived T waves in the X lead and caused T-wave inversion in the Z lead. Prolonging FRPs in the same area caused T-wave inversion in lead X and increased T amplitude in lead Z. The form of derived T waves qualitatively corresponded to serial T-wave abnormalities seen in patients with myocardial infarction.
11840342	Expression and regulation of Cyr61 in human breast cancer cell lines.	We have shown that Cyr61, an angiogenic regulator, is overexpressed in invasive and metastatic human breast cancer cells and tumor biopsies. We have further demonstrated that Cyr61 promotes acquisition of estrogen-independence and anti-estrogen resistance in vivo in breast cancer cells. Moreover, we have demonstrated that Cyr61 induces tumor formation and tumor vascularization in vivo, events mediated through the activation of the MAPK and the Akt signaling pathways. Here we investigate how Cyr61 expression is regulated in both estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cells. We demonstrate that Cyr61 mRNA and protein expression is inducible by estrogen and anti-estrogens in ER-positive breast cancer cells. We show that a labile protein as well as a negative regulator might be involved in Cyr61 expression in estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells. Other important regulators of Cyr61 expression in breast cancer cells that we found are the phorbol ester TPA, vitamin D, and retinoic acid. TPA causes positive regulation of Cyr61 expression in ER-positive MCF-7 cells. Vitamin D induces a transient stimulatory effect on Cyr61 gene expression. Lastly, retinoic acid has a negative effect on Cyr61 expression and downregulates its expression in MCF-7 cells. Interestingly, most of these effects are not seen in aggressive breast cancer cells that do not express ER and express high levels of Cyr61, such as the MDA-MB-231 cells. Our results are in agreement with our knowledge that Cyr61 promotes tumor growth, and that tumor-promoting agents have a positive impact on cells that express low levels of Cyr61, such as the ER-positive breast cancer cells; however, these agents have no significant effect on cells that express high levels of Cyr61. Our findings suggest an association between increased Cyr61 expression and an aggressive phenotype of breast cancer cells.
12140767	The docking protein Gab2 is overexpressed and estrogen regulated in human breast cancer.	Grb2-associated binder 2 (Gab2) is a recently identified member of the Gab/Daughter of sevenless family of docking proteins, which localize, amplify and integrate signaling pathways activated by various receptors including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). To date, Gab2 signaling has been primarily investigated in hematopoietic cells. Here we report marked overexpression of Gab2 in a subset of breast cancer cell lines relative to normal breast epithelial strains and a trend for increased Gab2 expression in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive lines. Overexpression relative to normal ductal epithelium was also observed in some primary breast cancers. In MCF-7 breast cancer cells Gab2 was markedly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to heregulin and also following EGF, insulin or bFGF administration, indicating that a variety of RTKs implicated in breast cancer development or progression couple to this docking protein. In hormone-responsive breast cancer cells, GAB2 mRNA and protein expression were induced by estradiol in a manner sensitive to the pure anti-estrogen ICI 182780, indicating that this regulation is mediated via the ER. Gab2 therefore represents a novel link between steroid and growth factor signaling in breast cancer, and when overexpressed, may modulate the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to these important growth regulators.
12732733	Binding and recognition in the assembly of an active BRCA1/BARD1 ubiquitin-ligase complex.	BRCA1 is a breast and ovarian cancer tumor suppressor protein that associates with BARD1 to form a RINGRING heterodimer. The BRCA1BARD1 RING complex functions as an ubiquitin (Ub) ligase with activity substantially greater than individual BRCA1 or BARD1 subunits. By using NMR spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis, we have mapped the binding site on the BRCA1BARD1 heterodimer for the Ub-conjugating enzyme UbcH5c. The results demonstrate that UbcH5c binds only to the BRCA1 RING domain and not the BARD1 RING. The binding interface is formed by the first and second Zn(2+)-loops and central alpha-helix of the BRCA1 RING domain, a region disrupted by cancer-predisposing mutations. Unexpectedly, a second Ub-conjugating enzyme, UbcH7, also interacts with the BRCA1BARD1 complex with similar affinity, although it is not active in Ub-ligase activity assays. Thus, binding alone is not sufficient for BRCA1-dependent Ub-ligase activity.
7538666	CD40 on human endothelial cells: inducibility by cytokines and functional regulation of adhesion molecule expression.	Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (EC) constitutively express a low level of CD40 antigen as detected by monoclonal antibody binding and fluorescence flow cytometric quantitation. The level of expression on EC is increased about 3-fold following 24 h treatment with optimal concentrations of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1, interferon beta, or interferon gamma; both interferons show greater than additive induction of CD40 when combined with tumor necrosis factor or interleukin 1. Expression of CD40 increases within 8 h of cytokine treatment and continues to increase through 72 h. A trimeric form of recombinant murine CD40 ligand acts on human EC to increase expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules, including E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1. CD40 may be detected immunocytochemically on human microvascular EC in normal skin. We conclude that endothelial CD40 may play a role as a signaling receptor in the development of T-cell-mediated inflammatory reactions.
7844566	Interferon-beta strong cytopathic effect on human papillomavirus type 16-immortalized HPK-IA cell line, unexpectedly not shared by interferon-alpha.	We report a novel, unusually severe cytopathic effect of interferon-beta (IFN-beta). Data concerning antibody neutralization, induction and recovery time course, CPE50 dose, impact on oxidative metabolic activity and 1D SDS-PAGE total cellular protein analysis are provided for preliminary characterization. This cytopathic effect appears to be linked to human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) genome presence as it is markedly evident in the HPV-16-immortalized HPK-IA cell line, but is not induced in diploid keratinocytes. It is also not induced in highly malignant SiHa cells suggesting that it also requires a fairly conserved phenotype. This effect is unexpectedly not shared by IFN-alpha pointing to a discrimination between IFN-alpha and -beta signal despite the well-known sharing of a common receptor. It remains to be clarified whether this divergence, undetectable in other cellular systems, represents a direct effect of viral presence or a non-specific consequence of cellular homoeostatic disregulation induced by the papillomavirus genome.
9254622	Sequential metal binding by the RING finger domain of BRCA1.	Analysis of the amino acid sequence encoded by the familial breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA1 [Miki et al. (1994) Science 266, 66-71], revealed the presence of an amino-terminal RING finger domain, a zinc binding motif found in a variety of proteins. Previously determined structures of two RING finger peptides from other proteins revealed that each RING finger sequence forms a single domain that includes two interleaved metal binding sites. One is a four-cysteine site comprised of metal binding residues 1, 2, 5, and 6 (in terms of position along the amino acid sequence) (site 1) and the other is a three-cysteine, one-histidine site involving metal binding residues 3, 4, 7, and 8 (site 2). We have characterized the metal binding and metal-dependent folding properties of peptides encompassing the BRCA1 RING finger. Using cobalt(II) as a spectroscopic probe, we have found that metal binding is sequential, with site 1 becoming nearly fully occupied prior to metal binding to site 2. More detailed thermodynamic analysis as well as studies of a variant peptide revealed that metal binding appears to be anticooperative with dissociation constants of 3 x 10(-8) M for site 1, 5 x 10(-7) M for site 2 with site 1 unoccupied, and 8 x 10(-6) M for site 2 when site 1 is occupied. Circular dichroism spectroscopic studies revealed that the BRCA1 RING finger peptide is somewhat structured at pH 7 in the absence of metal ions, with further structural changes occurring after the metal binding.
9738006	The C-terminal (BRCT) domains of BRCA1 interact in vivo with CtIP, a protein implicated in the CtBP pathway of transcriptional repression.	The BRCA1 tumor suppressor encodes a polypeptide with two recognizable protein motifs: a RING domain near the N terminus and two tandem BRCT domains at the C terminus. Studies of tumor-associated mutations indicate that the RING and BRCT sequences are required for BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression. In addition, recent work has shown that BRCA1 is a potent regulator of RNA transcription and that the BRCT domains are also essential for this activity. Therefore, we used the Sos recruitment system to screen for proteins that bind this critical region of BRCA1. Our results show that the BRCT domains interact in vivo with CtIP, a protein originally identified on the basis of its association with the CtBP transcriptional co-repressor. This finding suggests that BRCA1 regulates gene expression, at least in part, by modulating CtBP-mediated transcriptional repression. Moreover, the in vivo interaction between BRCA1 and CtIP is completely ablated by each of three independent tumor-associated mutations affecting the BRCT motifs of BRCA1. These results indicate that the BRCA1-CtIP interaction may be required for tumor suppression by BRCA1.
9922477	In acute lymphoblastic leukemia deletion of the tumor suppressor gene P16 is associated with abnormal interferon genes.	The putative tumor-suppressor gene p16 was mapped to human chromosome 9p21, close to the interferon alpha cluster. The frequency and association of gene alterations of p16, interferon alpha and interferon beta were investigated in a total of 39 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) patients. Of these, 10 patients (25.6%) presented abnormalities of at least one of the three genes studied. In 32 ALL cases studies of the three genes could be accomplished. In 23 out of 32 ALL cases the 3 genes studied were normally preserved. In the remaining 9 ALL, p16 was affected in 8 cases by homozygous deletions. In 2 patients, p16 deletion was associated with homozygous deletions for interferon alpha and interferon beta genes and in 1 case with total deletion of interferon beta 1 gene and partial deletion of interferon alpha. In the remaining 5 cases, p16 was the only gene deleted with no alteration of type I interferon genes. These data indicate that p16 gene is deleted in a higher frequency than type I interferon genes in ALL. Moreover, within the ALL group with p16 gene deletion, 37.5% are associated with interferon deletions and in general, ALL with alpha and/or beta interferon gene deletions are associated with p16 deletions. Therefore, p16 gene deletion with preserved type I interferon genes in some ALL suggests that the absence of this cdk inhibitor may disturb the normal cell cycle and favor blast transformation.
10518542	BRCA1-associated growth arrest is RB-dependent.	BRCA1 is a susceptibility gene for breast and ovarian cancer with growth-inhibitory activity for which the mechanism of action remains unclear. When introduced into cells, BRCA1 inhibits growth of some but not all cell lines. In an attempt to uncover the mechanism of growth suppression by BRCA1, we examined a panel of cell lines for their ability to reduce colony outgrowth in response to BRCA1 overexpression. Of all variables tested, only those cells with wild-type pRb were sensitive to BRCA1-induced growth suppression. In cells with an intact rb gene, inactivation of pRb by HPV E7 abrogates the growth arrest imposed by BRCA1. In accordance with these observations, we found that BRCA1 could not suppress BrdUrd uptake in primary fibroblasts from rb-/- mice and exhibited an intermediate ability to inhibit DNA synthesis in rb+/- as compared with rb+/+ cells. We further found that the BRCA1 protein complexes with the hypophosphorylated form of pRb. This binding is localized to amino acids 304-394 of BRCA1 protein and requires the ABC domain of pRb. In-frame deletion of BRCA1 fragment involved in interaction with pRb completely abolished the growth-suppressive property of BRCA1. Although it has been reported that BRCA1 interacts with p53, we find the p53 status did not affect the ability of BRCA1 to suppress colony formation. Our data suggest that the growth suppressor function of BRCA1 depends, at least in part, on Rb.
8764100	BRCA1 is a 220-kDa nuclear phosphoprotein that is expressed and phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner.	Mouse polyclonal antibodies, raised against three regions of the human BRCA1 protein, were characterized and revealed BRCA1 as a 220-kDa nuclear phosphoprotein in normal cells. All three antisera recognize both in vitro-translated and recombinant, baculovirus-derived BRCA1, which co-migrate with BRCA1 from the human breast epithelia cell line, HBL100. BRCA1 expression and phosphorylation are shown to be cell cycle dependent, with greatest expression and phosphorylation occurring in S and M phases. Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and other kinases associated with cyclins D and A are shown to bind to and phosphorylate BRCA1, suggesting that the biological activity of BRCA1 may be regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases.
8780884	BRCA1 expression is induced before DNA synthesis in both normal and tumor-derived breast cells.	Insight into the function of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene may be gained by studying its regulation. In this study, the expression of BRCA1 was examined as a function of the cell cycle in normal and tumor-derived breast epithelial cells. Cells arrested in G(zero) or early in G1 contained low levels of BRCA1 mRNA. After release, populations of cells reached maximal levels of BRCA1 in late G1 and S phase. Induction of BRCA1 was shown to occur before the onset of DNA synthesis by synchronizing cells at the G1-S boundary. Levels of the BRCA1 protein were regulated in a similar manner. No difference was observed between primary cultures of normal mammary epithelial cells and immortalized tumor-derived cell lines. These results suggest that BRCA1 may function at the G1-S checkpoint.
10356923	[The role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in hereditary breast cancer].	From 5% to 10% of breast cancer cases result from an inherited predisposition. The majority of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer can be accounted for by mutation in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in transcription regulation. Although this role could be consistent with the reported localisation of the BRCA1/BRCA2 protein to the nucleus. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 may play an as yet undefined protective role in cells, as it is expressed in epithelial cells undergoing high levels of proliferation associated with differentiation.
11136250	Identification of Id4 as a regulator of BRCA1 expression by using a ribozyme-library-based inverse genomics approach.	"Expression of the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 is down-regulated in sporadic breast and ovarian cancer cases. Therefore, the identification of genes involved in the regulation of BRCA1 expression might lead to new insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of these tumors. In the present study, an ""inverse genomics"" approach based on a randomized ribozyme gene library was applied to identify cellular genes regulating BRCA1 expression. A ribozyme gene library with randomized target recognition sequences was introduced into human ovarian cancer-derived cells stably expressing a selectable marker [enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)] under the control of the BRCA1 promoter. Cells in which BRCA1 expression was upregulated by particular ribozymes were selected through their concomitant increase in EGFP expression. The cellular target gene of one ribozyme was identified to be the dominant negative transcriptional regulator Id4. Modulation of Id4 expression resulted in inversely regulated expression of BRCA1. In addition, increase in Id4 expression was associated with the ability of cells to exhibit anchorage-independent growth, demonstrating the biological relevance of this gene. Our data suggest that Id4 is a crucial gene regulating BRCA1 expression and might therefore be important for the BRCA1 regulatory pathway involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic breast and ovarian cancer."
11331335	BRCA1/2 testing: complex themes in result interpretation.	Since the cloning of BRCA1 and BRCA2, genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility has become more widespread. However, interpretation of test results is not always straightforward. To illustrate this point, five vignettes adapted from actual cases are presented. As these cases demonstrate, in many high-risk families, a deleterious mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 is not identified in an affected proband. There are several potential explanations for such a finding, namely that an undetected mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 may exist, or there could be a mutation in a rare or undiscovered gene. In addition, the possibility that women with breast cancer represent sporadic cases within hereditary cancer families must also be considered. Finally, the occurrence of BRCA1/2 variants of uncertain significance, often missense mutations, further complicates the risk assessment. In some of these instances, extending testing to relatives can be helpful to clarify results. When hereditary breast cancer cannot be ruled out, individuals may still be at increased risk for cancer and therefore need to obtain appropriate surveillance. The process of genetic counseling is critical both before and after testing to ensure that patients understand the potential medical and psychosocial implications of testing and are aware of available options and resources. A multidisciplinary approach to service delivery, which includes clinicians in genetics and oncology, can facilitate patients' decision making and provide continued access to information and support.
11521194	Disruption of BRCA1 LXCXE motif alters BRCA1 functional activity and regulation of RB family but not RB protein binding.	The tumor suppressor activity of the BRCA1 gene product is due, in part, to functional interactions with other tumor suppressors, including p53 and the retinoblastoma (RB) protein. RB binding sites on BRCA1 were identified in the C-terminal BRCT domain (Yarden and Brody, 1999) and in the N-terminus (aa 304-394) (Aprelikova et al., 1999). The N-terminal site contains a consensus RB binding motif, LXCXE (aa 358-362), but the role of this motif in RB binding and BRCA1 functional activity is unclear. In both in vitro and in vivo assays, we found that the BRCA1:RB interaction does not require the BRCA1 LXCXE motif, nor does it require an intact A/B binding pocket of RB. In addition, nuclear co-localization of the endogenous BRCA1 and RB proteins was observed. Over-expression of wild-type BRCA1 (wtBRCA1) did not cause cell cycle arrest but did cause down-regulation of expression of RB, p107, p130, and other proteins (e.g., p300), associated with increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. In contrast, expression of a full-length BRCA1 with an LXCXE inactivating mutation (LXCXE-->RXRXH) failed to down-regulate RB, blocked the down-regulation of RB by wtBRCA1, induced chemoresistance, and abrogated the ability of BRCA1 to mediate tumor growth suppression of DU-145 prostate cancer cells. wtBRCA1-induced chemosensitivity was partially reversed by expression of either Rb or p300 and fully reversed by co-expression of Rb plus p300. Our findings suggest that: (1) disruption of the LXCXE motif within the N-terminal RB binding region alters the biologic function of BRCA1; and (2) over-expression of BRCA1 inhibits the expression of RB and RB family (p107 and p130) proteins.
12215246	Genetic testing for women previously diagnosed with breast/ovarian cancer: examining the impact of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation searching.	This study sought to investigate the impact of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation searching on women previously diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer. In-depth interviews were undertaken with 30 women who had undergone a BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation search within the clinical setting. The main reasons reported for undergoing mutation searching were: to provide genetic information for other family members, general altruism, curiosity about the aetiology of cancer, and to provide information to facilitate risk management decisions. In the main, the process of undergoing genetic testing was not experienced as anxiety provoking. The benefit of receiving a result confirming the presence of a genetic mutation was seen as an end to uncertainty, whereas the costs included difficulties in disclosing information to kin and potentially increased anxiety about one's own or others' cancer risks. Women receiving an inconclusive test result reported a range of emotional reactions. There was evidence that some women misunderstood the meaning of this result, interpreting it as definitive confirmation that a cancer-predisposing mutation was not present within the family. It is concluded that women with cancer who participate in BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing need to receive clear information about the meaning and implications of the different types of test results. Some recommendations for clinical practice are discussed.
8674108	The tumor suppressor gene Brca1 is required for embryonic cellular proliferation in the mouse.	Mutations of the BRCA1 gone in humans are associated with predisposition to breast and ovarian cancers. We show here that Brca1+/- mice are normal and fertile and lack tumors by age eleven months. Homozygous Brca1(5-6) mutant mice die before day 7.5 of embryogenesis. Mutant embryos are poorly developed, with no evidence of mesoderm formation. The extraembryonic region is abnormal, but aggregation with wild-type tetraploid embryos does not rescue the lethality. In vivo, mutant embryos do not exhibit increased apoptosis but show reduced cell proliferation accompanied by decreased expression of cyclin E and mdm-2, a regulator of p53 activity. The expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is dramatically increased in the mutant embryos. Buttressing these in vivo observations is the fact that mutant blastocyst growth is grossly impaired in vitro. Thus, the death of Brca1(5-6) mutant embryos prior to gastrulation may be due to a failure of the proliferative burst required for the development of the different germ layers.
9798686	Conservation of function and primary structure in the BRCA1-associated RING domain (BARD1) protein.	The BRCA1 gene encodes a tumor suppressor that has been implicated in hereditary forms of breast and ovarian cancer. During S phase of the cell cycle, BRCA1 polypeptides are found in discrete nuclear bodies ('BRCA1 nuclear dots') together with HsRad51, a human homolog of the E. coli recA protein, and BARD1, a protein that interacts with BRCA1 to form a stable heterodimer. BARD1 is structurally similar to BRCA1 in that both molecules harbor an amino-terminal RING domain and two carboxy-terminal BRCT domains. Here we describe the amino acid sequence and expression pattern of murine Bard1. A comparison of the mouse and human sequences reveals that the recognizable protein motifs of BARD1 are well conserved, including the RING domain, the three tandem ankyrin repeats, and, to a lesser extent, the two BRCT domains. However, the remaining sequences of BARD1 display a markedly lower degree of phylogenetic conservation, comparable to those reported for BRCA1 and BRCA2. Moreover, murine Bard1 retains the ability to associate in vivo with BRCA1, and its expression pattern in adult mice mirrors that of Brca1, with elevated levels of RNA transcripts found in the testes and spleen. These data suggest that BRCA1 and BARD1 have co-evolved to participate in a common pathway of tumor suppression.
10580847	Is TP53 dysfunction required for BRCA1-associated carcinogenesis?	The identification of the breast/ovarian susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2 was an important advancement in the field of breast and ovarian cancer research. About 40-50% of site specific hereditary breast cancers and up to 80% of hereditary breast-ovarian cancers result from mutations in the BRCA1 gene. Although BRCA1 mediates multiple functions in the cell, including a role in DNA damage repair and gene transcription, the role of BRCA1 has not completely been elucidated yet. It has been suggested that mutational inactivation of TP53 may be required for BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis. Several studies have shown that TP53 is more frequently inactivated in BRCA1-associated tumors than in sporadic breast or ovarian cancer. Up to 90% of BRCA1-associated tumors harbor either a TP53 mutation and/or TP53 protein accumulation. The remaining tumors may well have other alterations affecting the cell cycle checkpoint. Loss of this checkpoint may be obligatory for BRCA1-tumorigenesis. In this review, we discuss recent advances in BRCA1-research and stress the pivotal role TP53 may play in BRCA1-associated carcinogenesis.
11712282	Effects of acetylcholine on regional pulmonary blood flow in patients with mitral stenosis.	The effect of acetylcholine was studied on the region of increased vascular resistance at the lung bases in patients with mitral stenosis. The patients had moderate elevations of pulmonary artery pressure. The distribution of blood flow and ventilation were measured in both lungs of 10 patients using radioactive xenon-133 and a scanning technique. Acetylcholine was then infused into one main pulmonary artery, and the distribution of blood flow and ventilation were measured again. One lung served as a control during the drug infusion. There was a small but significant increase in perfusion to the dependent lung zone during the drug infusion without a change in pulmonary artery pressure indicating localized vasodilation. Relative underperfusion was still present during the acetylcholine administration which indicated that increased vasomotor tone was not the principal pathophysiological mechanism for the increased vascular resistance. There was a decrease in ventilation to the lower zone of the lung receiving acetylcholine.
11712297	Phonocardiographic diagnosis of aortic ball variance.	Fatty infiltration causing changes in the silastic poppet of the Model 1000 series Starr-Edwards aortic valve prostheses (ball variance) has been detected with increasing frequency and can result in sudden death. Phonocardiograms were recorded on 12 patients with ball variance confirmed by operation and of 31 controls. Ten of the 12 patients with ball variance were distinguished from the controls by an aortic opening sound (AO) less than half as intense as the aortic closure sound (AC) at the second right intercostal space (AO/AC ratio less than 0.5). Both AO and AC were decreased in two patients with ball variance, with the loss of the characteristic high frequency and amplitude of these sounds. The only patient having a diminished AO/AC ratio (0.42) without ball variance at reoperation had a clot extending over the aortic valve struts. The phonocardiographic findings have been the most reliable objective evidence of ball variance in patients with Starr-Edwards aortic prosthesis of the Model 1000 series.
12887909	BRCA1-independent ubiquitination of FANCD2.	Monoubiquitination of the FANCD2 protein is a key step in the Fanconi anemia (FA) tumor suppressor pathway, coinciding with this molecule's accumulation at sites of genome damage. Strong circumstantial evidence points to a requirement for the BRCA1 gene product in this step. Here, we show that the purified BRCA1/BARD1 complex, together with E1 and UbcH5a, is sufficient to reconstitute the monoubiquitination of FANCD2 in vitro. Although siRNA-mediated knockdown of BRCA1 in human cells results in defective targeting of FANCD2 to sites of DNA damage, it does not lead to a defect in FANCD2 ubiquitination. Furthermore, ablation of the RING finger domains of either BRCA1 or BARD1 in the chicken B cell line DT40 also leaves FANCD2 modification intact. Consequently, while BRCA1 affects the accumulation of FANCD2 at sites of DNA damage, BRCA1/BARD1 E3 ligase activity is not essential for the monoubiquitination of FANCD2.
7759542	Regulation of Wnt5a mRNA expression in human mammary epithelial cells by cell shape, confluence, and hepatocyte growth factor.	The Wnts are a family of genes with a role in cell fate and morphological development in numerous embryonic and adult tissues. In mouse mammary tissue a subset of the Wnts have a function in the normal development of the gland, and aberrant expression of Wnts normally silent in this tissue causes mammary carcinomas. We have previously shown that Wnt5a expression is elevated in the epithelial component of proliferative lesions of human breast and have therefore examined the regulation of Wnt5a mRNA expression in the human mammary epithelial cell line HB2, which has a luminal phenotype and thus represents the most commonly transformed cell type in human breast cancer. Wnt5a was up-regulated 30-fold at confluence. This up-regulation was induced specifically by confluence and not by the growth arrest that accompanied it. In addition, Wnt5a was down-regulated 3-fold by changes in cell shape associated with the transition from growth on a two-dimensional surface (flat cell morphology) to growth in three-dimensional gels (spherical cell morphology). Cytoskeletal disruption with non-toxic doses of colchicine also induced a spherical morphology and brought about a dose-dependent down-regulation of Wnt5a. Wnt5a was also down-regulated 10-fold during the hepatocyte growth factor-induced branching of HB2 cell aggregates in collagen gels. The down-regulation of Wnt5a preceded the branching process. A similar result was obtained with primary human breast epithelial populations and the breast cancer cell line MDA468. We conclude that regulation of Wnt5a expression is a down-stream effect of signaling by hepatocyte growth factor. These results are consistent with a role for Wnt5a in mammary epithelial cell motility and are in accord with Xwnt5a's function in embryonal cell migration. If Wnt5a's function in human mammary epithelial cells is similar to that of Xwnt5a, its up-regulation at confluence may be a mechanism for inhibition of cell migration beyond confluence.
9261099	Complex regulation of the BRCA1 gene.	We have analyzed the promoter region of the human BRCA1 gene in detail and demonstrate that the expression of the BRCA1 gene is under complex regulation. First, its transcription is under the control of two promoters generating two distinct transcripts alpha and beta, and second, promoter alpha is shared with the adjacent NBR2 gene and is bi-directional. Both promoter alpha and promoter beta are responsive to estrogen stimulation. We also discerned that there are striking differences in both the genomic organization and immediate cis-control elements of the BRCA1 gene between humans and mice.
9812072	Preliminary clinical experience with the Bard XT coronary stent.	BACKGROUND: The Bard XT stent is a balloon expandable stent with a new design, consisting of discrete zigzag modules welded onto a flexible longitudinal spine. METHODS: To assess the safety and efficacy of this recently introduced coronary stent, we studied 81 patients (107 lesions) who underwent implantation of 108 such stents (66% elective). RESULTS: Primary success in stent delivery was 97.1% and angiographic success was achieved in all cases. Reference segment diameter was 2.69+/-1.4 mm and average lesion length 10.9 mm. Mean minimal luminal diameter before the procedure was 0.79+/-1.11 mm and increased to 2.55+/-1.09 mm after stenting. Diameter stenosis decreased from 76%+/-24% to 9%+/-12%. One Q wave and 1 non-Q-wave myocardial infarction occurred but no other significant complications were observed. At 1-month follow-up, angiographically documented subacute thrombosis occurred in 2 cases at days 1 and 3. Conclusions These preliminary data suggest that the Bard XT stent has a promising design for the safe and effective treatment of coronary lesions, even in the presence of high-risk clinical and unfavorable angiographic characteristics.
11526114	BRCA1 RING domain cancer-predisposing mutations. Structural consequences and effects on protein-protein interactions.	Cancer-predisposing missense mutations in the RING domain of BRCA1 primarily target Zn(2+)-liganding residues. Here we report on the structural consequences of such mutations introduced into the second Zn(2+) site (Site II) of the BRCA1 RING domain and their effect on the interaction with the BARD1 RING domain. Each of the BRCA1 Site II mutants still interact and form a stable heterodimer with BARD1. Limited proteolysis of BRCA1/BARD1 complexes, monitored by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectrometry, show that the mutations cause a local structural perturbation that is primarily confined to the second Zn(2+) binding loop of the BRCA1 subunit. These findings are consistent with the structure of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer, which shows this region is well removed from the helices required for dimerization with BARD1. Instead, the mutations alter a region of BRCA1 that appears to be required for interaction with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes.
10030809	The genetic basis of breast cancer and its clinical implications.	While it has long been recognized that a proportion of breast cancer cases are the result of an inherited familial predisposition, precise knowledge of the underlying genetic processes has been lacking. Recent advances in molecular biology, however, have shown that hereditary breast cancer may eventuate as a result of mutations on several specific gene loci including BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM gene, PTEN and p53. Several other less frequently occurring predisposition genes such as the androgen receptor gene (AR), the HNPCC genes and the oestrogen receptor gene may also be involved, but to a lesser extent. Overall, approximately 5-10% of all breast cancers are thought to involve one of these inherited predisposition genes, with BRCA1 and BRCA2 being responsible for as much as 90% of this group. Because of the complex nature of genetic testing, mutation analysis is not presently routinely available outside genetic counselling clinics. In this review the current knowledge and role of each predisposition gene is outlined and the management implications of genetic testing for members of breast cancer families for both affected and non-affected members are discussed. The need to provide comprehensive counselling for women with an inherited predisposition to breast cancer has seen the evolution of the familial cancer clinic, involving a multidisciplinary specialist team approach. Familial cancer clinics will provide individuals with information about their risk of developing breast cancer and offer advice regarding further management strategies. It is important that surgeons, who have traditionally played a key role in breast cancer treatment, remain cognizant of these advances in genetic molecular biology, and in so doing continue to remain key participants in the conduct of breast cancer management.
10764408	Transient induction of cytokine production in human myocardial fibroblasts by coxsackievirus B3.	Cytokine expression in enterovirus infections of the heart may trigger inflammation and have detrimental effects on myocytes. However, the induction of cytokines in human myocardial cells by cardiotropic enteroviruses, for example, Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), was not yet demonstrated. Fibroblasts are the predominant cell type of the myocardial interstitium before inflammatory infiltration develops. Hence, we investigated, by enzyme immunoassays, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), whether CVB3 induces cytokine expression in cultured human myocardial fibroblasts. As early as 3 hours after infection, RT-qPCR demonstrated a 2-fold increase of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 mRNA compared with basal transcription, resulting in a significant increase of IL-6 and IL-8 to a median level of 1500 pg/mL (range, 1246 to 1858) and 529 pg/mL (range, 428 to 601) in culture supernatants, respectively. IL-6 and IL-8 expression returned to basal levels within 3 and 5 days, respectively, despite a persistent (carrier-state) CVB3 infection. For comparison, IL-6 and IL-8 were induced in dermal fibroblasts later than 3 days after CVB3 infection. Although the low-level IL-1alpha transcription of myocardial fibroblasts was not significantly increased, IL-1alpha was released from cells to culture supernatants 5 days after infection. Furthermore, a suppression of interferon-beta transcription was demonstrated up to 24 hours after CVB3 infection of myocardial fibroblasts by highly sensitive NASBA. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a heart-specific pattern of a rapid and transient induction of proinflammatory cytokines after CVB3 infection, whereas the expression of protective interferon-beta was suppressed by CVB3.
12351678	Biochemical purification and pharmacological inhibition of a mammalian prolyl hydroxylase acting on hypoxia-inducible factor.	The product of the von Hippel-Lindau gene, pVHL, targets the alpha subunits of the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for polyubiquitination in the presence of oxygen. The binding of pVHL to HIF is governed by the enzymatic hydroxylation of conserved prolyl residues within peptidic motifs present in the HIFalpha family members. By using a biochemical purification strategy, we have identified a human homolog of Caenorhabditis elegans Egl9 as a HIF prolyl hydroxylase. In addition, we studied the activity of a structurally diverse collection of low molecular weight inhibitors of procollagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase as potential inhibitors of the HIF hydroxylase. A model compound of this series stabilized HIF in a variety of cells, leading to the increased production of its downstream target, vascular endothelial growth factor.
12914511	Human gene patents: the possible impacts on genetic services healthcare.	The patent system has been seen as a critical factor driving innovation in clinical medicine, particularly in medical devices and diagnostic assays. The licence terms and business model proposed by Myriad Genetics Inc. for testing the hereditary breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 could stifle innovation (particularly if other companies adopt similar business models), and are likely to limit the ability to provide high quality public genetic testing services in Australia. Under the Myriad model, testing for the BRCA1 gene would be undertaken by an organisation removed from the integrated public healthcare system. Based on overseas experience, Australia can expect a 2-3-fold increase in the cost of this testing, which will provide only partial information on the hereditary breast cancer status of the patient. Commercial exploitation of gene patents needs to be regulated to balance the patent holders' right to profit from their inventions (necessary to drive further innovation) and the public policy objective of high quality, equitable healthcare.
8917547	Brca2 is coordinately regulated with Brca1 during proliferation and differentiation in mammary epithelial cells.	We have analyzed the expression of the breast cancer susceptibility gene, Brca2, in mammary epithelial cells as a function of proliferation and differentiation. Our results demonstrate that Brca2 mRNA expression is tightly regulated during mammary epithelial proliferation and differentiation, and that this regulation occurs coordinately with Brca1. Specifically, Brca2 mRNA expression is up-regulated in rapidly proliferating cells; is down-regulated in response to serum deprivation; is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner, peaking at the G1/S boundary; and is up-regulated in differentiating mammary epithelial cells in response to glucocorticoids. In each case, an identical pattern of expression was observed for Brca1. These results indicate that proliferative stimuli modulate the mRNA expression of these two breast cancer susceptibility genes. In addition, the coordinate regulation of Brca1 and Brca2 revealed by these experiments suggests that these genes are induced by, and may function in, overlapping regulatory pathways involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation.
9215675	Isolation and characterisation of the NBR2 gene which lies head to head with the human BRCA1 gene.	To study the regulation of BRCA1 gene expression and the potential importance of dysregulation of this gene in breast and ovarian cancer, we have examined the 5' region of the human BRCA1 gene in detail. We have identified a new gene, NBR2, which is partially related to the NBR1 gene (formerly known as 1A1-3B and mapping directly adjacent to the pseudo-BRCA1 gene) and which lies head to head with the BRCA1 gene. The physical distance between the transcription start sites of the NBR2 and BRCA1 genes is 218 bp, suggesting that regulation of the expression of both genes may be co-ordinated through a bi-directional promoter. The NBR2 gene contains five exons spanning a genomic region of approximately 30 kb between the BRCA1 and pseudo-BRCA1 genes. Northern analysis showed that the NBR2 gene is expressed in all the tissues examined. The NBR2 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 112 amino acids and is predicted to encode a protein of approximately 12 kDa. Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of the NBR2 gene failed to identify any mutations in either breast or ovarian cancer, suggesting that if the NBR2 gene is involved in the development of these cancers, other mechanisms for tumorigenesis may exist. Hybridisation of NBR2 probes to zoo blots showed that the NBR2 gene is present in human and other primates. No hybridisation to DNA from other species was observed, suggesting that genomic elements controlling BRCA1 expression may differ between species.
10964110	Methylation of the BRCA1 promoter is associated with decreased BRCA1 mRNA levels in clinical breast cancer specimens.	Functional inactivation of BRCA1 is an important mechanism involved in breast cancer pathogenesis. Mutation is often responsible for BRCA1 inactivation in familial breast cancer, but is not responsible for the decreased levels of BRCA1 seen in a subset of sporadic breast cancer patients. To determine if aberrant cytosine methylation of the BRCA1 promoter is associated with decreased BRCA1 gene expression in human breast cancer, high resolution bisulfite sequence analysis was used to analyze the cytosine methylation status of the BRCA1 promoter in 21 axillary node negative breast cancer patients with known levels of BRCA1 expression. Aberrant cytosine methylation of the BRCA1 promoter was detected in three of 21 patient specimens. These three specimens also expressed the lowest levels of BRCA1. Results from this analysis show that aberrant cytosine methylation of the BRCA1 promoter is directly correlated with decreased levels of BRCA1 expression in human breast cancer, and suggest that epigenetic silencing may be one mechanism of transcriptional inactivation of BRCA1 in sporadic mammary carcinogenesis.
10991937	Identification of a functional nuclear export sequence in BRCA1.	Germ-line mutations in the tumor suppressor gene Brca1 confer increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancers. BRCA1 is a 1863-amino acid protein with roles in transcriptional regulation and the cellular responses to DNA damage. Given its function in these nuclear processes, the subcellular localization of BRCA1 is an important issue and has been the object of recent controversy. BRCA1 contains two nuclear localization signals and is most frequently detected in the cell nucleus by immunofluorescence microscopy. In this study, we show that BRCA1 is a nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling protein, capable of both entering and exiting the nucleus. We identified a functional Rev-type nuclear export sequence ((81)QLVEELLKIICAFQLDTGL) near the amino terminus of BRCA1 that facilitates export via the CRM1/exportin pathway. Mutational inactivation of this nuclear export sequence, or treatment of cells with the CRM1-specific export inhibitor leptomycin B, induced nuclear accumulation of ectopic full-length BRCA1. Moreover, overexpression of the CRM1 export receptor resulted in decreased nuclear localization of endogenous BRCA1. The unexpected ability of BRCA1 to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm may have implications for the regulation and function of this tumor suppressor.
11090615	Sequence-specific transcriptional corepressor function for BRCA1 through a novel zinc finger protein, ZBRK1.	BRCA1 has been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of DNA damage-inducible genes that function in cell cycle arrest. To explore the mechanistic basis for this regulation, a novel human gene, ZBRK1, which encodes a 60 kDa protein with an N-terminal KRAB domain and eight central zinc fingers, was identified by virtue of its interaction with BRCA1 in vitro and in vivo. ZBRK1 binds to a specific sequence, GGGxxx CAGxxxTTT, within GADD45 intron 3 that supports the assembly of a nuclear complex minimally containing both ZBRK1 and BRCA1. ZBRK1 represses transcription through this recognition sequence in a BRCA1-dependent manner. These results thus reveal a novel corepressor function for BRCA1 and provide a mechanistic basis for the biological activity of BRCA1 through sequence-specific transcriptional regulation.
11790560	The BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer, a tumor suppressor complex with ubiquitin E3 ligase activity.	Although the protein product of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene has been implicated in a surprisingly diverse array of biological processes, the molecular mechanism by which BRCA1 loss promotes tumor formation remains unclear. Nonetheless, a pivotal advance has been achieved by recent studies that establish BRCA1 and its partner polypeptide BARD1 as enzymatic mediators of protein ubiquitination. The potent ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer may be responsible for many of the biological properties attributed to BRCA1, including its ability to suppress tumor formation in normal cells.
11799689	Acid-base relationships in the blood of the toad, Bufo marinus. I. The effects of environmental CO2.	An abrupt increase in ambient CO2 resulted in a marked respiratory acidosis which took place within 30 min. During this time there was a considerable reduction in the PCO2 difference between arterial blood and inspired gas caused by an increase in ventilations. Prolonged CO2 exposure (24 h) showed that there was some compensation for the acidosis in that plasma bicarbonate concentrations increased substantially. At the same time, however, the PCO2 of arterial blood always rose so that the net result was usually only a small increase in pH. Upon return to air, the blood was backtitrated along a buffer line elevated above and parallel to that seen during the initial response to hypercapnia. The fall in arterial blood PCO2 during the early stages of recovery often led to pH values higher than those seen in the untreated animal. After 48 h in air, recovery had gone further with PCO2, pH and [HCO3-] levels approaching but rarely reaching the pre-exposure values.
10910365	Functional link of BRCA1 and ataxia telangiectasia gene product in DNA damage response.	BRCA1 encodes a familial breast cancer suppressor that has a critical role in cellular responses to DNA damage. Mouse cells deficient for Brca1 show genetic instability, defective G2-M checkpoint control and reduced homologous recombination. BRCA1 also directly interacts with proteins of the DNA repair machinery and regulates expression of both the p21 and GADD45 genes. However, it remains unclear how DNA damage signals are transmitted to modulate the repair function of BRCA1. Here we show that the BRCA1-associated protein CtIP becomes hyperphosphorylated and dissociated from BRCA1 upon ionizing radiation. This phosphorylation event requires the protein kinase (ATM) that is mutated in the disease ataxia telangiectasia. ATM phosphorylates CtIP at serine residues 664 and 745, and mutation of these sites to alanine abrogates the dissociation of BRCA1 from CtIP, resulting in persistent repression of BRCA1-dependent induction of GADD45 upon ionizing radiation. We conclude that ATM, by phosphorylating CtIP upon ionizing radiation, may modulate BRCA1-mediated regulation of the DNA damage-response GADD45 gene, thus providing a potential link between ATM deficiency and breast cancer.
12637547	Ets-2 and components of mammalian SWI/SNF form a repressor complex that negatively regulates the BRCA1 promoter.	Ets-2 is a transcriptional activator that can be modulated by ras-dependent phosphorylation. Evidence is presented indicating that ets-2 can also act as a transcriptional repressor. In the breast cancer cell line MCF-7, exogenous ets-2 repressed the activity of a BRCA1 promoter-luciferase reporter dependent on a conserved ets-2-binding site in this promoter. Conditional overproduction of ets-2 in MCF-7 cells resulted in repression of endogenous BRCA1 mRNA expression. To address the mechanism by which ets-2 could act as a repressor, a biochemical approach was used to identify proteins that interacted with the ets-2 pointed domain. From this analysis, components of the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex were found to interact with ets-2. Brg-1, the ATP-hydrolyzing component of the SWI/SNF complex, along with the BAF57/p50 and Ini1 subunits could be co-immunoprecipitated from cells with ets-2. The pointed domain of ets-2 directly interacted in vitro with the C-terminal region of Brg-1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The combination of Brg-1 and ets-2 could repress the BRCA1 promoter reporter in transfection assays. These results support a role for ets-2 as a repressor and indicate that components of the mammalian SNF/SWI complex are required as co-repressors.
12810625	Both DNA topoisomerase II-binding protein 1 and BRCA1 regulate the G2-M cell cycle checkpoint.	Cell cycle checkpoints play a central role in genomic stability. The human DNA topoisomerase II-binding protein 1 (TopBP1) protein contains eight BRCA1 COOH terminus motifs and shares similarities with Cut5, a yeast checkpoint Rad protein. TopBP1 also shares many features with BRCA1. We report that, when expression of TopBP1 protein is inhibited in BRCA1 mutant cells, mimicking a TopBP1, BRCA1 double-negative condition, the G(2)-M checkpoint is strongly abrogated and apoptosis is increased after ionizing radiation. However, a BRCA1-negative or a TopBP1-negative background resulted in only partial abrogation of the G(2)-M checkpoint. The BRCA1 mutant and TopBP1-reduced condition specifically destroys regulation of the Chk1 kinase but not the Chk2 kinase, suggesting involvement in the ataxia telangiectasia-related pathway. These results indicate that both TopBP1 and BRCA1 specifically regulate the G(2)-M checkpoint, partially compensating each function.
10531328	Transcription of BRCA1 is dependent on the formation of a specific protein-DNA complex on the minimal BRCA1 Bi-directional promoter.	BRCA1 is the first tumor suppressor gene linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Its involvement in sporadic breast cancer, however, remains unclear. Recent studies showed that a loss or lowered expression of BRCA1 is not uncommon in nonfamilial breast cancers. In addition, there have been cases of inherited BRCA1-linked breast cancer with as yet unidentified mutation. Misregulation of BRCA1 at the transcription level is a possible mechanism for loss of BRCA1 expression. To understand transcriptional regulation of the BRCA1 gene, we cloned and examined the BRCA1 promoter, by both functional reporter gene analyses and protein-DNA complex formation electrophorectic mobility shift assays. A bi-directional promoter could be located within a 229-base pair (bp) intergenic region between BRCA1 and its neighboring gene, NBR2. Deletion analyses further delineated a minimal 56-bp EcoRI-HaeIII fragment, which could drive transcription in the NBR2 gene direction 2-4-fold higher than in the BRCA1 direction in all cell lines tested. Furthermore, transcriptional activity in the BRCA1 direction was undetectable in the muscle cell line C2C12, whereas activity in the NBR2 direction was maintained. These results were consistent with the expression pattern of the respective genes. A specific protein-DNA complex was detected when nuclear extracts from HeLa cells and Caco2, a colon cell line, were incubated with the 56-bp minimal promoter. This protein binding activity was further localized to an 18-bp fragment and might involve a tissue-specific factor, because binding was not detected in the C2C12 cell line. The correlation of the detection of this protein-DNA complex only in those cell lines that expressed the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in the BRCA1 direction suggests a significant positive role of this complex in the transcription of the BRCA1 gene.
10962562	BRCA1 activation of the GADD45 promoter.	Breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 has been implicated in the control of gene regulation and such regulated genes are thought to mediate the biological role of BRCA1. Overexpression of BRCA1 induces GADD45, a p53-regulated and stress-inducible gene. However, the molecular mechanism by which BRCA1 induces the expression GADD45 remains unclear. In this report, we have shown that the GADD45 promoter is strongly activated following expression of wild-type BRCA1. In contrast, both the tumor-derived BRCA1 mutants (p1749R and Y1853insA) and truncated BRCA1 mutant protein (Delta500 - 1863 BRCA1), which lack transactivation activity, were unable to activate the GADD45 promoter, indicating that the BRCA1-mediated activation of the GADD45 promoter requires normal transcriptional properties of BRCA1. BRCA1 did not induce the c-Jun and c-fos promoters, which rules out a general effect of BRCA1 on other immediate-responsive genes. Expression of the human papillomavirus E6 and the dominant-negative mutant p53 proteins had no effect on the induction of the GADD45 promoter by BRCA1, suggesting that activation of the GADD45 promoter by BRCA1 is independent of cellular p53 function. With the 5'-deletion analysis, the BRCA1-responsive element of the GADD45 promoter was mapped at the region from -121 to -75. Disruption of this region resulted in the abrogation of BRCA1 activation of the GADD45 promoter. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the mechanism by which BRCA1 induces GADD45 is mainly through the transactivation of the GADD45 promoter, further demonstrating the evidence that GADD45 acts as one of the BRCA1-regulated genes. Oncogene (2000) 19, 4050 - 4057.
11106241	BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in breast cancer families with multiple primary cancers.	Ninety-eight women ascertained from high-risk breast/ovarian cancer clinics with breast cancer reporting at least one other primary cancer in themselves or in a relative with breast cancer were compared with 99 women with breast cancer who reported a family history of breast cancer only. All DNA was screened for coding region mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 using heteroduplex analysis, followed by direct sequencing. Our data indicate that 42.9% of families reporting breast and any second nonbreast type of primary cancer in the same individual had a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, as compared with the 12.1% of families reporting breast cancer only (P < 0.001). Among the 66 women reporting breast cancer and a nonovarian second primary cancer, 15 (22.7%) had mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (P = 0.04). Among the 32 families where ovarian cancer was the second primary cancer, 27 (84.4%) had a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (P < 0.001). BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were twice as common in the presence of a reported second nonovarian cancer. These data suggest that the presence of multiple primary cancer of any kind may predict for an increased likelihood of finding a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and supports previous studies suggesting that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations may be associated with an increased susceptibility to cancers other than breast and ovarian cancer.
14583453	Phytoestrogen-rich diets modulate expression of Brca1 and Brca2 tumor suppressor genes in mammary glands of female Wistar rats.	Phytoestrogens are natural compounds with anticancer, proliferation, differentiation, and chemopreventive effects, for which several mechanisms have been proposed. In the present study, modulation of Brca1 and Brca2 expression by different phytoestrogen-rich diets has been investigated in ovariectomized Wistar rats. Two hundred mammary glands were harvested in three independent experiments. Brca1 and Brca2 mRNAs were quantified by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, and their proteins by immunohistochemistry. The first experiment compared the influence of different phytoestrogens [flax-seed, isoflavones (IFs), or rutin]. A 10% increase in Brca1 mRNA expression was shown after flax-seed consumption, whereas no variation was noted for Brca2 mRNA, nor for Brca1 and Brca2 proteins. In the second experiment, two soy IFs sources (Novasoy or Soylife) were given at different concentrations to the animals. Only Brca2 mRNA was increased and only at high doses. Finally, the effect of IFs was compared with that of estradiol. An increase in mRNA for both genes was noted after estradiol treatment and with the highest dose of IFs. In conclusion, our results show that IFs, given in the diet at different doses, are able to increase Brca1 and Brca2 mRNA in ovariectomized female Wistar rat. However, no variation in Brca1 or Brca2 protein expression was demonstrated, whatever the experimental conditions were.
9832560	In vitro repression of Brca1-associated RING domain gene, Bard1, induces phenotypic changes in mammary epithelial cells.	BRCA1-associated RING domain (BARD1) was identified as a protein interacting with the breast cancer gene product BRCA1. The identification of tumorigenic missense mutations within BRCA1 that impair the formation of BARD1-BRCA1 complexes, and of BARD1 mutations in breast carcinomas, sustain the view that BARD1 is involved in BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression. We have cloned the murine Bard1 gene and determined that its expression in different tissues correlates with the expression profile of Brca1. To investigate the function of Bard1, we have reduced Bard1 gene expression in TAC-2 cells, a murine mammary epithelial cell line that retains morphogenetic properties characteristic of normal breast epithelium. Partial repression of Bard1, achieved by the transfection of TAC-2 cells with plasmids constitutively expressing ribozymes or antisense RNAs, resulted in marked phenotypic changes, consisting of altered cell shape, increased cell size, high frequency of multinucleated cells, and aberrant cell cycle progression. Furthermore, Bard1-repressed cell clones overcame contact inhibition of cell proliferation when grown in monolayer cultures and lost the capacity to form luminal structures in three-dimensional collagen gels. These results demonstrate that Bard1 repression induces complex changes in mammary epithelial cell properties which are suggestive of a premalignant phenotype.
9836472	BRCA1 and BRCA2 in breast cancer families from Wales: moderate mutation frequency and two recurrent mutations in BRCA1.	Mutations in the BRCA1/BRCA2 genes account for varying proportions of breast cancer families studied, and demonstrate considerable variation in mutational spectra coincident with ethnic and geographical diversity. We have screened for mutations in 17 families from Wales with two or more cases of breast cancer under age 50 and/or ovarian cancer. Eight out of 17 (47%) families had demonstrable mutations. Six out of 17 (35%) carried BRCA1 mutations and 2 out of 17 (12%) carried BRCA2 mutations. Two recurrent mutations in BRCA1 were identified, which appear to represent founder mutations in this population. These data support the existence of additional breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes.
10819536	Localization of BRCA1 protein at the cellular level.	Based on its amino acid sequence and the existence of three nuclear localization signal (NLS)3 regions, BRCA1 is likely to be a cell cycle-dependent nuclear protein, regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk) and associated with nuclear proteins such as Rad51 and BARD1, involved in transcription regulation and participating in DNA replication checkpoints. However, many authors have also described a cytoplasmic expression pattern. Moreover, BRCA1 was present not only in a dot like pattern in the nucleus but also associated with a channel-like system of cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum invaginating into the nucleus. BRCA1 expression patterns can also be influenced by alternative splice variants and by cell cycle-dependent expression level and localization. Further ultrastructural and confocal studies using C-terminal antibodies, that do not react with C-terminal truncated form of BRCA1 should shed new light upon the exact localization of BRCA1.
11250682	The pathology of familial breast cancer: How do the functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 relate to breast tumour pathology?	Women with mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 are thought to be tumour suppressor genes since the wild type alleles of these genes are lost in tumours from heterozygous carriers. Several functions have been proposed for the proteins encoded by these genes which could explain their roles in tumour suppression. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been suggested to have a role in transcriptional regulation and several potential BRCA1 target genes have been identified. The nature of these genes suggests that loss of BRCA1 could lead to inappropriate proliferation, consistent with the high mitotic grade of BRCA1-associated tumours. BRCA1 and BRCA2 have also been implicated in DNA repair and regulation of centrosome number. Loss of either of these functions would be expected to lead to chromosomal instability, which is observed in BRCA1 and BRCA2-associated tumours. Taken together, these studies give an insight into the pathogenesis of BRCA-associated tumours and will inform future therapeutic strategies.
8588979	Interferon beta mediated intracellular signalling traffic in human lymphocytes.	The early molecular mechanisms activated by the treatment of human lymphocytes with human interferon beta have been studied. These identify an early increase with respect to control, in diacylglycerol (DG) levels as response to interferon treatment. Such a DG production was derived from the rapid and sequential activation of phosphoinositide specific phospholipase C and phospholipase D pathway. This suggests that a synergistic involvement of phosphatidylinositol-bis-phosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis and phosphatidylcholine (PC) breakdown provide early molecular events upon the interaction between interferon beta and its cell surface receptors. This finally leads to the slowing down of cell growth.
10074913	Quantification of BRCA1 protein in sporadic breast carcinoma with or without loss of heterozygosity of the BRCA1 gene.	In sporadic breast cancer, no mutations of the BRCA1 gene have been reported so far, whereas BRCA1 mRNA is markedly decreased in invasive breast cancer. To elucidate the contribution of the BRCA1 gene in sporadic breast cancer, we quantified the BRCA1 protein, using [125I] labeling of whole-cell proteins, lentil-lectin affinity chromatography, immunoprecipitation by anti-BRCA1 antibodies (C-20, D-20, I-20 and K-18), purification of the immune complex by protein A affinity chromatography and chromato-focusing. As loss of 1 allele may lead to a decreased expression of the gene, 10 tumors were previously checked for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the BRCA1 gene, using 3 intragenic microsatellite markers. Our results indicated that the BRCA1 gene product was decreased in the 4 tumors with LOH compared with matched normal breast tissues. Reduced amounts of BRCA1 protein were also detected in 3 of 6 tumors without LOH. Our quantitative method allowed us to demonstrate that the BRCA1 protein level was decreased in sporadic invasive breast carcinomas with or without LOH of the BRCA1 gene, implying multiple mechanisms of BRCA1 expression down-regulation in these tumors. Our data suggest that the amount of BRCA1 protein present may play an important role in human sporadic breast carcinoma.
10963625	Estrogen receptor-mediated processes in normal and cancer cells.	The role of estrogens in breast and other cancers has been extensively investigated for many years, and historically most of these studies have focused on the hormonal regulation of cell proliferation. The most recent work in this area has focused on the expression of genes likely to mediate proliferation (e.g., growth factors, proto-oncogenes, etc.) and their regulation by the classic nuclear estrogen receptor, ER-alpha. In this chapter, we present a synopsis of several new developments in this area of ER-regulated gene expression. These developments include the following: 1) the selective activation of ER domains by partial estrogen antagonists, such as tamoxifen and other ligands; 2) the effects of ER-alpha overexpression and gene knockout on the development of breast and uterine cancers in experimental animal models; 3) mechanisms by which steroid hormones regulate programmed cell death, cell cycle progression, cell-substratum interactions, and genomic instability in cancer cells; 4) identification of nuclear proteins that interact with the ER in the presence of agonists and antagonists, the effect of ligand binding on the receptor structure, and the interactions of liganded and nonliganded receptors with coactivators, corepressors, and other regulatory proteins; and 5) the biochemical properties, cellular distribution, and potential biologic roles for the newly discovered ER-beta. Although there is an increasing interest in understanding the role of estrogens as endogenous carcinogens, it remains clear that ER-mediated regulation of gene expression plays many significant roles in normal and cancer cells, and increased knowledge of the mechanisms involved will improve our overall understanding of hormonal carcinogenesis.
11504724	Redistribution of BRCA1 among four different protein complexes following replication blockage.	The BRCA1 protein is known to participate in multiple cellular processes. In these experiments, we resolved four distinct BRCA1-containing complexes. We found BRCA1 associated with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (holo-pol), a large mass complex called the fraction 5 complex, the Rad50-Mre11-Nbs1 complex, and a complex that has not been described previously. We observed this new complex after treating cells with hydroxyurea, suggesting that the hydroxyurea-induced complex (HUIC) is involved with the response to DNA replication blockage. After hydroxyurea treatment of cells, BRCA1 content decreased in the holo-pol and the fraction 5 complex, and BRCA1 was redistributed to the HUIC. The HUIC was shown not to contain a number of holo-pol components or the Rad50-Mre11-Nbs1 complex but was associated with the BRCA1-associated RING domain protein BARD1. These data suggest that BRCA1 participates in multiple cellular processes by multiple protein complexes and that the BRCA1 content of these complexes is dynamically altered after DNA replication blockage.
12640109	Negative regulation of BRCA1 gene expression by HMGA1 proteins accounts for the reduced BRCA1 protein levels in sporadic breast carcinoma.	A drastic reduction in BRCA1 gene expression is a characteristic feature of aggressive sporadic breast carcinoma. However, the mechanisms underlying BRCA1 downregulation in breast cancer are not well understood. Here we report that both in vitro and in vivo HMGA1b protein binds to and inhibits the activity of both human and mouse BRCA1 promoters. Consistently, murine embryonic stem (ES) cells with the Hmga1 gene deleted display higher Brca1 mRNA and protein levels than do wild-type ES cells. Stable transfection of MCF-7 cells with the HMGA1b cDNA results in a decrease of BRCA1 gene expression and in a lack of BRCA1 induction after estrogen treatment. Finally, we found an inverse correlation between HMGA1 and BRCA1 mRNA and protein expression in human mammary carcinoma cell lines and tissues. These data indicate that HMGA1 proteins are involved in transcriptional regulation of the BRCA1 gene, and their overexpression may have a role in BRCA1 downregulation observed in aggressive mammary carcinomas.
10995872	Heregulin regulates the actin cytoskeleton and promotes invasive properties in breast cancer cell lines.	The metastatic process requires changes in tumor cell adhesion properties, cell motility and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. The erbB2 proto-oncogene is overexpressed in approximately 30% of breast cancers and is a major prognostic parameter when present in invasive disease. A ligand for the erbB2 receptor has not yet been identified but it can be activated by heterodimerization with heregulin (HRG)-stimulated erbB3 and erbB4 receptors. The HRGs are a family of polypeptide growth factors that have been shown to play a role in embryogenesis, tumor formation, growth and differentiation of breast cancer cells. The erbB3 and erbB4 receptors are involved in transregulation of erbB2 signaling. The work presented here suggests biological roles for HRG including regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and induction of motility and invasion in breast cancer cells. HRG-expressing breast cancer cell lines are characterized by low erbB receptor levels and a high invasive and metastatic index, while those which overexpress erbB2 demonstrate minimal invasive potential in vitro and are non-tumorigenic in vivo. Treatment of the highly tumorigenic and metastatic HRG-expressing breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 with an HRG-neutralizing antibody significantly inhibited proliferation in culture and motility in the Boyden chamber assay. Addition of exogenous HRG to non-invasive erbB2 overexpressing cells (SKBr-3) at low concentrations induced formation of pseudopodia, enhanced phagocytic activity and increased chemomigration and invasion in the Boyden chamber assay. The specificity of the chemomigration response to HRG is demonstrated by inhibition with the anti-HRG neutralizing antibody. These results suggest that either HRG can act as an autocrine or paracrine ligand to promote the invasive behavior of breast cancer cells in vitro or thus may enhance the metastatic process in vivo.
11777551	Chemokine receptor expression on B cells and effect of interferon-beta in multiple sclerosis.	We investigated the B-cell expression of chemokine receptors CXCR3, CXCR5 and CCR5 in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients in relapse of multiple sclerosis (MS) and in neurological controls. Chemokine receptor expression was also studied in interferon-beta-treated patients with relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS. We observed significantly higher expression of CXCR3 on B cells in the CSF in active MS than in controls. Patients with active MS also had higher B-cell expression of CCR5 in blood. No major differences between RRMS and SPMS patients were detected, and chemokine receptor expression was not affected by interferon-beta treatment.
11785521	Behavioral regulation of the milieu interne in man and rat.	"In regulating the internal homeostatic environment mammals, by necessity, employ behavioral strategies that differ from the tactics used in coping with contingencies in the external environment. When an animal consumes a meal, the palatability of that meal is automatically adjusted in accordance with the ultimate internal effects of that meal. If the meal causes toxicosis, the animal acquires an aversion for the taste of the meal; conversely, if recuperation follows ingestion of the meal, the taste of that meal is enhanced. Unlike the learning that occurs when externally referred visual and auditory signals are followed by punishment in the form of peripheral pain or reward in the form of food in the mouth, conditioning to the homeostatic effects of food can occur in a single trial and rarely requires more than three to five trials, even though the ultimate effects of the meal are delayed for hours. Paradoxically, the animal need not be aware of the ultimate internal effect in the same sense that it is aware of external contingencies. For example, an aversion can be acquired even if the animal is unconscious when the agent of illness is administered. Thus, the way in which food-effects are stored in memory may be fundamentally different from the way in which memories of specific time-space strategies devised for external contingencies are stored. This separation of function is indicated by limbic lesions which disrupt conditioning to a buzzer that is followed by shock and facilitate conditioning to a taste that is followed by illness. Operationally speaking, one can describe both aversion conditioning and buzzer-shock conditioning in the spacetime associationistic terms of classical conditioning. However, psychologically speaking, one must realize that in aversion conditioning the animal does not act as if it were acquiring an ""if-then"" strategy. It acts as if a hedonic shift, or a change in the incentive value of the flavor were taking place. Such hedonic shifts are critical in regulation of the internal milieu. When an animal is in need of calories, food tends to be more palatable; as the caloric deficit is restored, food becomes less palatable. If the animal's body temperature is below optimum, a warm stimulus applied to the skin is pleasant. When body temperature is too high, the converse is true. In this way, homeostatic states monitored by internal receptors produce changes in the incentive values of external stimuli sensed by the peripheral receptors, and guide feeding behavior. In mammals at least, the gustatory system, which provides sensory control of feeding, sends fibers to the nucleus solitarius. This brainstem relay station also receives fibers from the viscera and the internal monitors of the area postrema. Ascending fibers bifurcate at the level of the pons and project toward the feeding areas of the hypothalamus and the cortex. The olfactory system which primarily projects to the limbic system does not play a primary role in adjusting food incentives. Rather, it plays a secondary role in the activation of feeding, as do other external sensory systems. This specialized conditioning mechanism, which specifically adjusts gustatory hedonic values through delayed visceral feedback, is widespread among animals, including man and rat. These two species are remarkably similar in their thresholds and preferences for gustatory stimuli. The behavioral similarities are based on the animals' having similar gustatory systems, similar convergence of gustatory and internal afferents to the nucleus solitarius, and similar midbrain regulatory mechanisms. Thus, it is not surprising that the feeding of obese rats with internal hypothalamic damage resembles the feeding of obese human beings insensitive to the internal signs of this caloric state. Obviously, man has a highly specialized form of symbolic communication and the rat does not, yet man's cognitive specialization does not prevent him from developing aversions to food consumed before illness even when he knows that his illness was not caused by food (43)."
11799687	Metabolic sources of heat and power in tuna muscles. II. Enzyme and metabolite profiles.	Tuna appear able to maintain their muscles at 5-10 degrees C above ambient by balancing heat produced in situ and conserved by a counter-current heat exchanger with heat lost to the sea. Metabolite profiles under three different activity states (rest, burst swimming, and steady state swimming during feeding frenzies at sea) were used to identify which metabolic processes in white and red muscles could account for observed excess temperatures. During burst swimming, transient changes in metabolite levels indicate that the metabolism of both red and white muscle contributes to powering burst swimming; red muscle work is sustained mainly by oxidative metabolism while white muscle work depends upon an intense anaerobic glycolysis. The rate of metabolism in red muscle is easily high enough to account for the measured (10 degrees C) increase in temperature at this time. However, in white muscle, anaerobic glycolysis can account for only about a 2 degrees C maximum rise in temperature. The highest sustained swimming speeds and the highest muscle temperatures in skipjack are found during feeding frenzies at sea. As in burst swimming, during steady-state swimming red muscle temperatures can be accounted for by oxidative metabolism. In the case of white muscle, the lactate measurements indicate that anaerobic glycolysis could only lead to a 0.3 degree C temperature rise. However, if the fraction of utilized glycogen that is not fermented (about 60%) is assumed to be fully oxidized, enough heat is generated to raise white muscle temperatures by over 10 degrees C. The observed excess temperature at this time is about 8-10 degrees C, showing that anarerobic carbohydrate metabolism in white muscle is probably the major heat source during feeding frenzies. These interpretations are fully consistent with enzyme profiles of red and white muscles in tuna. They do not, however, explain why tuna have warm muscles. The latter problem is briefly discussed.
14550570	BRCA1 interacts with FHL2 and enhances FHL2 transactivation function.	Germ-line mutations in BRCA1 are associated with an increased lifetime risk of developing breast and/or ovarian tumors. The BRCA1 gene product is a 220-kDa protein that contains a tandem of two BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domains required for transcription. In an attempt to understand how BRCA1 exerts its function through BRCT domains, we search for partners of the BRCT domains of BRCA1. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified the four and a half LIM-only protein 2 (FHL2) as a novel BRCA1 interacting protein. We demonstrate that BRCA1 and FHL2 can physically associate in vitro, in yeast, and in human cells. BRCA1 interacted with FHL2 through its second BRCT domain and the interaction of FHL2 with BRCA1 requires the last three LIM domains of FHL2. BRCA1 enhanced FHL2-mediated transcriptional activity in transient transfections. Tumor-derived transactivation-deficient BRCA1 mutants showed a reduced ability to enhance transactivation by FHL2. Lack of BRCA1 binding sites in the FHL2 completely abolished the FHL2 transactivation function. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that FHL2 mRNA levels may be downregulated in many breast cancer cell lines. These results suggest that the BRCA1-FHL2 interaction may be involved in transcriptional regulation and play a significant role in cancer cell growth.
7887918	Phosphorylation of the adenomatous polyposis coli protein and its possible regulatory effects in cells.	The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene is etiologically associated with familial adenomatous polyposis and gastrointestinal malignancies, but its cellular function and role in tumorigenesis are unclear. Recent reports indicate that wild-type, but not mutant, APC gene product (APC) is associated with and promotes the assembly of cytoskeletal microtubules in vitro, suggesting that this mechanism has importance in tumor development. Because other microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) undergo phosphorylation in their normal functioning, we postulated that APC is a phosphoprotein. HCT116 cells, containing full-length APC protein, were [32P]-prelabeled, and a 300-kDa band corresponding to phosphorylated APC was immunoprecipitated using each of three different anti-APC antibodies. High voltage electrophoresis of [32P]-labeled APC showed the presence of phospho-serine and phospho-threonine residues. Further immunoprecipitation analyses showed phosphorylation of i) full-length APC in human lymphoblastoid cells and ii) carboxyl-truncated APC in SW480 and DiFi colon carcinoma cells. Thus, APC is probably a phosphoprotein in normal and malignant tissues. We hypothesize a mechanism whereby phosphorylation of APC may play a regulatory role in its interaction with microtubules. This may involve phosphorylation of (Ser/Thr)-Pro amino acid motifs in APC's basic domain. We propose that deletion of this domain disrupts APC binding to microtubules, explaining how APC mutations are linked to cancer development.
8033082	Wild-type but not mutant APC associates with the microtubule cytoskeleton.	The adenomatous polyposis coli protein (APC) is mutated in familial adenomatous polyposis patients as well as in sporadic colorectal tumors. In an attempt to further understand the function of APC, the subcellular localization of APC was examined. Wild-type and mutant forms of APC were expressed in mammalian cells and protein detected by immunofluorescence using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. Staining of wildtype APC protein revealed a filamentous network which extended throughout the cytoplasm and colocalized with microtubules. In striking contrast, mutant APC protein gave a diffuse cytoplasmic staining pattern. Treatment with a microtubule depolymerizing agent, nocodazole, caused APC as well as tubulin to become diffusely cytoplasmic. In addition, immunoperoxidase staining of transfected APC protein followed by transmission electron microscopy revealed staining of microtubules. These results suggest that wild-type but not mutant APC protein may be associated with the microtubule cytoskeleton.
8033083	The APC gene product associates with microtubules in vivo and promotes their assembly in vitro.	Defects in the APC gene occur frequently in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis coli and are associated with the progression of sporadic tumors of the colon and stomach. We examined the subcellular location of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein resulting from transient expression of full length and partial APC complementary DNAs in epithelial cells. Immunofluorescent detection revealed an association of APC with cytoplasmic microtubules. Expression of partial complementary DNA constructs indicated that the carboxy-terminal region of the APC protein, typically deleted in cancers, is essential for this association. The same APC polypeptides that associated with microtubules in vivo also dramatically promoted their assembly in vitro. These results suggest that wild-type APC protein binds to and affects the assembly of microtubules, whereas the mutants identified in tumors have lost this activity.
8242605	A rapid screening method to detect nonsense and frameshift mutations: identification of disease-causing APC alleles.	A functional screen for nonsense and frameshift mutations has been devised that allows genes of interest to be scanned in segments. This assay is based on the cloning of these segments in-frame with a colorimetric marker gene (lacZ) followed by screening for the level of functional activity from the marker polypeptide (beta-galactosidase). Individuals at risk for any one of a number of genetic diseases, in particular familial adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), can be quickly screened for chain-terminating mutations introduced by stops and frameshifts. At present, scanning of the APC gene for mutation requires significant effort because it is a large gene and most APC mutations are unique. Therefore, this assay offers a powerful option for the diagnosis of this and other genetic diseases, as well as great potential for the development of a similar rapid screen to detect APC mutations in colorectal adenomas and carcinomas.
8636161	Biochemical characterization of ezrin-actin interaction.	The highly related actin isoforms are thought to have different functions. We recently demonstrated a polarized distribution of actin isoforms in gastric parietal cells and association of gastric ezrin with the cytoplasmic beta-actin isoform (Yao, X., Chaponnier, C., Gabbiani, G., and Forte, J. G. (1995) Mol. Biol. Cell. 6, 541-557). Here we used ultrastructural immunocytochemistry to verify that beta-actin is located within canalicular microvilli and the apical cortex of parietal cells, similar to the localization reported for ezrin. Furthermore, we tested whether ezrin binds preferentially to cytoplasmic beta-actin compared with the skeletal muscle alpha-actin isoform. Purified cytoplasmic beta-actin (from erythrocytes) and skeletal alpha-actin were assembled with gastric ezrin. Co-sedimentation experiments showed that gastric ezrin selectively co-pelleted with the beta-actin isoform and only very poorly with alpha-actin. Binding of erythrocytic beta-actin to ezrin is saturable with a molar ratio of approximately 1:10 (ezrin:actin) and a dissociation constant approximately 4.6 x 10(-8) M. In addition, ezrin promoted pyrene-labeled actin assembly, with predominant effects on filament elongation and a distinct preference for beta-actin compared with alpha-actin. Given these isoform-selective associations, we speculate that actin isoforms might segregate into different functional domains and exert specificity by interacting with isoform-orientated binding proteins.
9266414	Immunological aspects of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis and their application for new therapeutic strategies.	The etiology of multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), is not yet known. Immunological, clinical and pathological studies suggest, however, that T lymphocytes directed against myelin antigens are involved in the pathogenesis of MS. The examination of an experimental animal model for MS, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), demonstrated that myelin basic protein-(MBP) or proteolipidprotein-(PLP) specific T cells mediate the destruction of CNS myelin. In recent years, elegant studies in EAE showed that encephalitogenic T cells recognize short peptides of MBP or PLP in the context of MHC/HLA-class II molecules, express a restricted number of T cell receptor (TCR) molecules and secrete interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha/beta. Understanding the pathogenetic steps of demyelination at the molecular level led to highly specific immunotherapies of EAE targeting each individual molecule. MBP- and PLP-specific T cells with similar properties could also be isolated from MS patients and control individuals. Due to their heterogeneity in terms of specificity, function and TCR usage, it was difficult, however, to draw definite conclusions from these results, so far. The recent approval of interferon-beta, a cytokine that antagonizes a number of the effects of interferon-gamma, for the treatment of MS has raised great interest in examining novel strategies for immunotherapies in MS. The basic concepts as well as the current candidates for such new immunotherapies will be outlined in this brief article.
10694935	The adenomatous polyposis coli protein.	Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are associated with most colorectal cancers. The APC protein has been implicated in many aspects of tumour development. This article will discuss recent data suggesting that APC may have multiple functions in the cell. First, APC is a component of the Wnt signalling pathway; second, APC may have a role in cell migration; finally, APC may regulate proliferation and apoptosis.
10731146	Molecular linkage underlying microtubule orientation toward cortical sites in yeast.	Selective microtubule orientation toward spatially defined cortical sites is critical to polarized cellular processes as diverse as axon outgrowth and T cell cytotoxicity. In yeast, oriented cytoplasmic microtubules align the mitotic spindle between mother and bud. The cortical marker protein Kar9 localizes to the bud tip and is required for the orientation of microtubules toward this region. Here, we show that Kar9 directs microtubule orientation by acting through Bim1, a conserved microtubule-binding protein. Bim1 homolog EB1 was originally identified through its interaction with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor, raising the possibility that an APC-EB1 linkage orients microtubules in higher cells.
10903136	Conformational changes in activated protein C caused by binding of the first epidermal growth factor-like module of protein S.	The first epidermal growth factor-like module of human plasma protein S (EGF1, residues 76-116) was chemically synthesized and tested for its ability to inhibit the anticoagulant cofactor activity of protein S for the anticoagulant protease, activated protein C (APC). EGF1 completely inhibited the stimulation of APC activity by protein S in plasma coagulation assays, with 50% inhibition at approx. 1 microM+ EGF1, suggesting direct binding of EGF1 to APC. To investigate a direct interaction between EGF1 and APC, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments were employed. APC labelled in the active site with fluorescein as the donor, and phospholipid vesicles containing octadecylrhodamine as the acceptor, showed that EGF1 association with APC caused an increase in energy transfer consistent with a relocation of the active site of APC from 94 A (9.4 nm) to 85 A above the phospholipid surface (assuming kappa(2)=2/3). An identical increase in energy transfer between the APC active site-bound fluorescein and phospholipid-bound rhodamine was obtained upon association of protein S or protein S-C4b-binding protein complex with APC. The latter suggests the presence of a ternary complex of protein S-C4b-binding protein with APC on the phospholipid surface. To confirm a direct interaction of EGF1 with APC, rhodamine was covalently attached to the alpha-N-terminus of EGF1, and binding of the labelled EGF1 to APC was directly demonstrated using FRET. The data suggested a separation between the active site of APC and the N-terminus of EGF1 of 76 A (kappa(2)=2/3), placing the APC-bound protein S-EGF1 close to, but above, the phospholipid surface and near the two EGF domains of APC. Thus we provide direct evidence for binding of protein S-EGF1 to APC and show that it induces a conformational change in APC.
11237529	The many faces of the tumor suppressor gene APC.	Inactivation of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein is a critical early step in the development of familial and sporadic colon cancer. Close examination of the function of APC has shown that it is a multifunctional protein involved in a wide variety of processes, including regulation of cell proliferation, cell migration, cell adhesion, cytoskeletal reorganization, and chromosomal stability. Tantalizing clues to the different functions of APC have been provided by the identification of proteins interacting with several discrete motifs within APC. Each of these putative functions could link APC inactivation with tumorigenesis. Here, we will summarize recent findings regarding the diverse role of APC. We will emphasize the interaction of APC with different binding partners, the role of these complex interactions for normal functioning of the cell, and how disruption of these interactions may play a role in tumor development. The rapid progress made recently shows the many faces of APC, leading to a constant reappreciation of this multitasking tumor suppressor protein.
11248549	Regulating cellular actin assembly.	Cellular actin assembly is tightly regulated. The study of pathogen motility has led to the identification of several cellular factors that are critical for controlling this process. Pathogens such as Listeria require Ena/VASP and Arp2/3 proteins to translate actin polymerization into movement. Recent work has extended these observations and uncovered some similarities and surprising differences in the way cells and pathogens utilize the actin cytoskeleton.
11731323	Modular complexes that regulate actin assembly in budding yeast.	The actin cytoskeleton of budding yeast contains an extensive set of actin-associated proteins with conserved mammalian counterparts. For more than 20 years, yeast has been used as a model organism to dissect the in vivo functions of these factors, revealing an intricate web of genetic interactions in the cell. Now, a surge of biochemical reports is defining the physical interactions and activities of these proteins and providing mechanistic insights into their cellular roles. The emerging view is that most actin-associated proteins do not act alone but, rather, associate to form modular protein complexes that regulate actin assembly and organization.
11752272	MagnaportheDB: a federated solution for integrating physical and genetic map data with BAC end derived sequences for the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea.	We have created a federated database for genome studies of Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of rice blast disease, by integrating end sequence data from BAC clones, genetic marker data and BAC contig assembly data. A library of 9216 BAC clones providing >25-fold coverage of the entire genome was end sequenced and fingerprinted by HindIII digestion. The Image/FPC software package was then used to generate an assembly of 188 contigs covering >95% of the genome. The database contains the results of this assembly integrated with hybridization data of genetic markers to the BAC library. AceDB was used for the core database engine and a MySQL relational database, populated with numerical representations of BAC clones within FPC contigs, was used to create appropriately scaled images. The database is being used to facilitate sequencing efforts. The database also allows researchers mapping known genes or other sequences of interest, rapid and easy access to the fundamental organization of the M.grisea genome. This database, MagnaportheDB, can be accessed on the web at http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/fungal_genomics/mgdatabase/int.htm.
12058019	The adenomatous polyposis coli protein unambiguously localizes to microtubule plus ends and is involved in establishing parallel arrays of microtubule bundles in highly polarized epithelial cells.	Loss of full-length adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein correlates with the development of colon cancers in familial and sporadic cases. In addition to its role in regulating beta-catenin levels in the Wnt signaling pathway, the APC protein is implicated in regulating cytoskeletal organization. APC stabilizes microtubules in vivo and in vitro, and this may play a role in cell migration (Näthke, I.S., C.L. Adams, P. Polakis, J.H. Sellin, and W.J. Nelson. 1996. J. Cell Biol. 134:165-179; Mimori-Kiyosue, Y., N. Shiina, and S. Tsukita. 2000. J. Cell Biol. 148:505-517; Zumbrunn, J., K. Inoshita, A.A. Hyman, and I.S. Näthke. 2001. Curr. Biol. 11:44-49) and in the attachment of microtubules to kinetochores during mitosis (Fodde, R., J. Kuipers, C. Rosenberg, R. Smits, M. Kielman, C. Gaspar, J.H. van Es, C. Breukel, J. Wiegant, R.H. Giles, and H. Clevers. 2001. Nat. Cell Biol. 3:433-438; Kaplan, K.B., A. Burds, J.R. Swedlow, S.S. Bekir, P.K. Sorger, and I.S. Näthke. 2001. Nat. Cell Biol. 3:429-432). The localization of endogenous APC protein is complex: actin- and microtubule-dependent pools of APC have been identified in cultured cells (Näthke et al., 1996; Mimori-Kiyosue et al., 2000; Reinacher-Schick, A., and B.M. Gumbiner. 2001. J. Cell Biol. 152:491-502; Rosin-Arbesfeld, R., G. Ihrke, and M. Bienz. 2001. EMBO J. 20:5929-5939). However, the localization of APC in tissues has not been identified at high resolution. Here, we show that in fully polarized epithelial cells from the inner ear, endogenous APC protein associates with the plus ends of microtubules located at the basal plasma membrane. Consistent with a role for APC in supporting the cytoskeletal organization of epithelial cells in vivo, the number of microtubules is significantly reduced in apico-basal arrays of microtubule bundles isolated from mice heterozygous for APC.
12589682	Dynamic properties of APC-decorated microtubules in living cells.	The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour suppressor protein is a component of the Wnt signalling pathway in which it plays a major role in controlling nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and hence in the modulation of beta-catenin-regulated gene transcription. APC also associates with microtubules at the ends of cytoplasmic extensions in epithelial cells, a distribution that can be reproduced in COS cells ectopically expressing APC. To examine the effect of APC on microtubule properties, we monitored directly the behaviour of APC and of APC-decorated microtubules by time-lapse imaging of cytoplasmic extensions in live COS cells expressing APC tagged with a green fluorescent protein. On the proximal part of microtubules, APC was visualised as particulate material moving unidirectionally towards the plus end of microtubules. The distal parts of microtubules were uniformly decorated by APC and were animated by a motile behaviour in the form of aperiodic bending. This behaviour is likely to be the consequence of compression forces acting on microtubules encountering obstacles while elongating. The majority of APC-decorated microtubules in transfected COS cells was sensitive to depolymerisation by nocodazole, but they contained detyrosinated and acetylated alpha-tubulin, suggesting a reduction in the rate of subunit exchange at their growing end. Taken together, these results demonstrate that microtubule domains uniformly decorated by APC display dynamic and motile properties that may be significant for the postulated role of APC in targeting microtubules to specialised membrane sites.
7953530	Identification of six Tcp-1-related genes encoding divergent subunits of the TCP-1-containing chaperonin.	BACKGROUND: TCP-1 is a 60 kD subunit of a cytosolic hetero-oligomeric chaperone that is known to be involved in the folding of actin and tubulin. This protein is a member of the chaperonin family, which includes Escherichia coli GroEL, the mitochondrial heat-shock protein Hsp60, the plastid Rubisco-subunit-binding protein and the archaebacterial protein TF55. These chaperonins assist the folding of proteins upon ATP hydrolysis. RESULTS: Using two-dimensional gel analysis, we have identified nine different subunits of TCP-1-containing chaperonin complexes from mammalian testis and seven different subunits of such complexes from mouse F9 cells. We have isolated full-length mouse cDNAs encoding six novel TCP-1-related polypeptides and show that these cDNAs encode subunits of the TCP-1-containing cytosolic chaperonin. These subunits are between 531 and 545 residues in length. Their sequences are 25-36% identical to one another, 27-35% identical to that of TCP-1 and 32-39% identical to that of the archaebacterial chaperonin, TF55. We have named these genes, Cctb, Cctg, Cctd, Ccte, Cctz and Ccth, which encode the CCT beta, CCT gamma, CCT delta, CCT epsilon, CCT zeta and CCT eta subunits, respectively, of the 'Chaperonin Containing TCP-1' (CCT). All the CCT subunits contain motifs that are also shared by all other known chaperonins of prokaryotes and eukaryotic organelles, and that probably relate to their common ATPase function. CONCLUSION: It is likely that each CCT subunit has a specific, independent function, as they are highly diverged from each other but conserved from mammals to yeast. We suggest that the expansion in the number of types of CCT subunit, compared with other chaperonins, has allowed CCT to carry out the more complex functions that are required for the folding and assembly of highly evolved eukaryotic proteins.
9533689	Determination of the gelsolin binding site on F-actin: implications for severing and capping.	Gelsolin is a six-domain protein that regulates actin assembly by severing, capping, and nucleating filaments. We have used electron cryomicroscopy and helical reconstruction to identify its binding site on F-actin. To obtain fully decorated filaments under severing conditions, we have studied a derivative (G2-6) that has a reduced severing efficiency compared to gelsolin. A three-dimensional reconstruction of G2-6:F-actin was obtained by electron cryomicroscopy and helical reconstruction. The structure shows that gelsolin bridges two longitudinally associated monomers when it binds the filament. The F-actin binding region of G2-6 is centered axially at subdomain 3 and radially between subdomains 1 and 3 of the upper actin monomer. Our results suggest that for severing to occur, both gelsolin and actin undergo large conformational changes.
9576568	Familial adenomatous polyposis: from bedside to benchside.	Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a dominantly inherited cancer-predisposition syndrome with an incidence of between 1:17,000 and 1:5,000. The condition has been causally linked to mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene located at 5q21. Virtually all mutations in the APC gene are truncating mutations, resulting in loss of function of the APC protein. Spontaneous germline mutation of this gene occurs frequently and accounts for the high incidence of FAP. The gene is somatically mutated at an early point in the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma progression. Somatic mutations of the APC gene are also frequently observed in a variety of other human carcinomas. Isolation of the APC gene has led to the recognition of genotype-phenotype correlations and, together with protein studies, has helped to elucidate the structure and function of the APC protein. This report aims to take the reader from a clinical appreciation to a molecular understanding of FAP.
9801792	Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase binds to profilin through the p85 alpha subunit and regulates cytoskeletal assembly.	Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), endowed with catalytic (110kDa) and regulatory (85kDa) subunits co-precipitates with anti-tyrosine antibodies in mitogen-activated cells. Association of PI3-K with cytoskeleton activates its catalytic activity through undeciphered mechanisms. Recently Singh et al., (Biochemistry, 35, 16544-16549, 1996) have shown that profilin activates PI3-K activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Consequently, we investigated the interaction between the PI3-K and profilin employing the GSTp85 alpha fusion protein and the results indicate a specific interaction between profilin and p85 alpha. The effect of p85 alpha/profilin complex on polymerization of actin monomers was monitored fluorimetrically employing pyrene-labelled actin monomers. It was noted that p85 alpha/profilin complex inhibits actin polymerization suggesting that profilin can simultaneously bind to actin as well as to p85 alpha. The affinity of p85 alpha/profilin complex to actin increases in the presence of p85 alpha subunit of PI3-K as compared to profilin itself.
10773885	Regulation and function of the interaction between the APC tumour suppressor protein and EB1.	The interaction between the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour suppressor and the microtubule-associated protein EB1 was examined. Immunoprecipitation suggested that APC and EB1 were not associated in cultures of HCT116 cells arrested in mitosis. The C-terminal 170 amino acids of APC, purified as a bacterial fusion protein, precipitated EB1 from cell extracts, significantly refining the location of the EB1 interaction domain in APC. In vitro phosphorylation of this fusion protein by either protein kinase A or p34cdc2 reduced its ability to bind to EB1. Expression of GFP fusions to C-terminal APC sequences lacking or including the APC basic domain but encompassing the EB1 binding region in SW480 cells revealed a microtubule tip association which co-localized with that of EB1. Expression of the basic domain alone revealed a non-specific microtubule localization. In vitro interaction studies confirmed that the APC basic domain did not contribute to EB1 binding. These findings strongly suggest that the interaction between APC and EB1 targets APC to microtubule tips, and that the interaction between the two proteins is down-regulated during mitosis by the previously described mitotic phosphorylation of APC.
11125204	Actin cytoskeleton: a signaling sensor in cell volume regulation.	The actin microfilaments are well known dynamic structures that support and organize the cell membrane and functions associated with the membrane such as ion channels and transporters. In addition, many aspects of cellular physiology seem to be actively modulated by changes in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, which involve reorganization and restructuring of the filaments. For both of these reasons, the actin cytoskeleton has attracted special attention since the early days of cell volume regulation research. Mechanisms controlling the actin equilibrium in response to external stimuli were studied and the signaling cascades leading to the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics have been partially elucidated. They include: a) activation of specific actin binding proteins that regulate actin polymerization dynamics, b) activation of protein kinases or phosphatases regulating phosphorylation of specific cytoskeletal proteins and c) activation of signal transduction pathways leading from membrane receptor activation to actin reorganization involving small GTPases of the Rho and Rac families. These intracellular signal transducers are activated by extracellular stimuli that include hormones, growth factors, cytokines, or ions, many of them in turn are partially known to participate in cell volume regulation. These findings provide strong evidence that the actin cytoskeleton is involved in cell volume regulation by sensing and mediating extracellular signals.
11145293	Novel germline APC mutations in Swedish patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and Gardner syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a familial cancer syndrome in which affected individuals develop multiple adenomatous polyps and are thereby at greatly increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. Gardner syndrome is a variant of FAP, in which the patients also develop extraintestinal tumors, in particular osteomas and desmoid tumors. An attenuated form of the disease (AFAP) is associated with fewer polyps, but still a high risk for colorectal cancer. Germline mutations in the adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC) gene cause FAP and Gardner syndrome and have recently been associated also with the development of AFAP. METHODS: We have analysed the entire APC gene for germline mutations in 7 patients with FAP and in 6 patients with suspected AFAP. Mutation screening was performed by direct sequencing of exons 1-14 and using the protein truncation test for analysis of exon 15. RESULTS: Novel disease-causing germline mutations, all of which resulted in truncation of the APC protein, were identified in 6 of the 7 patients with FAP or Gardner syndrome. No APC mutation was detected in any of the 6 patients with suspected AFAP. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports novel FAP- and Gardner syndrome-causing mutations in the APC gene. The lack of APC mutations in patients with multiple polyps at young age indicates that other genetic defects may cause this phenotype.
11584277	Drosophila APC2 and Armadillo participate in tethering mitotic spindles to cortical actin.	Proper positioning of mitotic spindles ensures equal allocation of chromosomes to daughter cells. This often involves interactions between spindle and astral microtubules and cortical actin. In yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans, some of the protein machinery that connects spindles and cortex has been identified but, in most animal cells, this process remains mysterious. Here, we report that the tumour suppressor homologue APC2 and its binding partner Armadillo both play roles in spindle anchoring during the syncytial mitoses of early Drosophila embryos. Armadillo, alpha-catenin and APC2 all localize to sites of cortical spindle attachment. APC2-Armadillo complexes often localize with interphase microtubules. Zeste-white 3 kinase, which can phosphorylate Armadillo and APC, is also crucial for spindle positioning and regulates the localization of APC2-Armadillo complexes. Together, these data suggest that APC2, Armadillo and alpha-catenin provide an important link between spindles and cortical actin, and that this link is regulated by Zeste-white 3 kinase.
11606402	Nontruncating APC germ-line mutations and mismatch repair deficiency play a minor role in APC mutation-negative polyposis.	Familial adenomatous polyposis, an autosomal-dominantly inherited colorectal cancer predisposition syndrome, is caused by germ-line mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Despite the use of different screening methods, studies worldwide fail to identify APC mutations in 20-50% of all familial adenomatous polyposis patients (APC mutation-negatives). In this study, missense mutations in the coding region of the APC gene, which would have been missed by the protein truncation test, as well as mutations in the APC promoter and the 3' untranslated region, were determined by the single nucleotide polymorphism discovery assay and direct DNA sequencing in 31 mutation-negative polyposis patients. Seventeen gene alterations were identified, whereof four (12.9%) represent possibly pathogenic germ-line mutations: silent A290T (promoter) and A8822G (3' untranslated region) as well as missense R99W and E1317Q (coding region). The 27 remaining, truly APC mutation-negative polyposis patients displayed a significantly later age at diagnosis compared with APC mutation carriers (46.1 versus 35.2 years; P < 0.01). APC mutation-negative individuals with >100 colonic polyps were more likely to present with extracolonic disease (P < 0.05) than those with <100. Assessment of microsatellite instability (MSI), a hallmark of mismatch repair deficiency, in 68 tumors from 21 truly APC mutation-negative patients, identified 4 (5.9%) unstable tubulo-villous adenomas (3 MSI-High and 1 MSI-Low), stemming from 4 (19%) unrelated individuals and likely to be caused by hMLH1 promoter hypermethylation. In conclusion, only a small proportion of APC germ-line mutation carriers is missed by the protein truncation test, and mismatch repair deficiency does not seem to substantially contribute to tumor development in APC mutation-negative polyposis patients.
11689433	Actin-dependent membrane association of the APC tumour suppressor in polarized mammalian epithelial cells.	Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is mutated in most colorectal cancers. APC downregulates nuclear beta-catenin, which is thought to be critical for its tumour suppressor function. However, APC may have additional and separate functions at the cell periphery. Here, we examine polarized MDCK and WIF-B hepatoma cells and find that APC is associated with their lateral plasma membranes. This depends on the actin cytoskeleton but not on microtubules, and drug wash-out experiments suggest that APC is delivered continuously to the plasma membrane by a dynamic actin-dependent process. In polarized MDCK cells, APC also clusters at microtubule tips in their basal-most regions. Microtubule depolymerization causes APC to relocalize from these tips to the plasma membrane, indicating two distinct peripheral APC pools that are in equilibrium with each other in these cells. Truncations of APC such as those found in APC mutant cancer cells can neither associate with the plasma membrane nor with microtubule tips. The ability of APC to reach the cell periphery may thus contribute to its tumour suppressor function in the intestinal epithelium.
12110608	FcepsilonRI cross-linking-induced actin assembly mediates calcium signalling in RBL-2H3 mast cells.	1. To determine the role of actin assembly in the Ca(2+) signalling of mast cells activated by cross-linking of FcepsilonRI, we examined the effects of cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization. 2. In the RBL-2H3 cells, F-actin content was increased by sensitization with anti-dinitrophenol (DNP) IgE. In these cells, cytochalasin D induced oscillatory increases in cytosolic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)); these increase were inhibited by jasplakinolide, a stabilizer of actin filaments. 3. In the IgE-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells, DNP-human serum albumin (DNP-HSA) augmented actin assembly. DNP-HSA also increased the production of IP(3), [Ca(2+)](i) and degranulation. Cytochalasin D enhanced all of these DNP-HSA-induced effects. 4. In a Ca(2+)-free solution, DNP-HSA induced a transient increase in [Ca(2+)](i), and this increase was accelerated by cytochalasin D. After cessation of the DNP-HSA-induced Ca(2+) release, the re-addition of Ca(2+) induced a sustained increase in [Ca(2+)](i) through capacitative Ca(2+) entry (CCE), and this increase was enhanced by cytochalasin D. 5 The effect of cytochalasin D in enhancing the CCE activity was prevented by xestospongin C. 6. In contrast, neither the Ca(2+) release nor the CCE activation that was induced by thapsigargin was affected by cytochalasin D. 7. These results suggest that actin de-polymerization stimulates the FcepsilonRI-mediated signalling to augment the release of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum in RBL-2H3 cells.
12210511	What can humans learn from flies about adenomatous polyposis coli?	Somatic or inherited mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are a frequent cause of colorectal cancer in humans. APC protein has an important tumor suppression function to reduce cellular levels of the signaling protein beta-catenin and, thereby, inhibit beta-catenin and T-cell-factor-mediated gene expression. In addition, APC protein binds to microtubules in vertebrate cells and localizes to actin-rich adherens junctions in epithelial cells of the fruit fly Drosophila (Fig. 1). Very little is known, however, about the function of these cytoskeletal associations. Recently, Hamada and Bienz have described a potential role for Drosophila E-APC in cellular adhesion, which offers new clues to APC function in embryonic development, and potentially colorectal adenoma formation and tumor progression in humans.
12372335	Suppression of kinesin expression disrupts adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) localization and affects beta-catenin turnover in young adult mouse colon (YAMC) epithelial cells.	Mutational inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein initiates most hereditary and sporadic colon cancers. The tumor-suppressive effect of APC is mediated by promoting degradation of the oncogenic transcriptional activator beta-catenin, and loss of APC function often results in nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin in cancer cells. APC is a nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling protein and moves along microtubules in the cytoplasm. However, the molecular motor proteins responsible for APC translocation and the implications of APC trafficking on beta-catenin turnover are unknown. Here we show that APC protein is associated with microtubules and is colocalized with kinesin heavy chain (KHC) and beta-catenin to clusters of puncta at the tip regions of cellular extensions in a conditionally immortalized mouse colon epithelial cell line, young adult mouse colon (YAMC, APC+/+). Inhibition of KHC expression using an antisense oligonucleotide disrupts peripheral translocation of APC and induces nucleocytoplasmic accumulation of beta-catenin. These data indicate that KHC-mediated APC translocation is tightly coordinated with beta-catenin turnover in the cell.
12388762	Evidence that an interaction between EB1 and p150(Glued) is required for the formation and maintenance of a radial microtubule array anchored at the centrosome.	EB1 is a microtubule tip-associated protein that interacts with the APC tumor suppressor protein and components of the dynein/dynactin complex. We have found that the C-terminal 50 and 84 amino acids (aa) of EB1 were sufficient to mediate the interactions with APC and dynactin, respectively. EB1 formed mutually exclusive complexes with APC and dynactin, and a direct interaction between EB1 and p150(Glued) was identified. EB1-GFP deletion mutants demonstrated a role for the N-terminus in mediating the EB1-microtubule interaction, whereas C-terminal regions contributed to both its microtubule tip localization and a centrosomal localization. Cells expressing the last 84 aa of EB1 fused to GFP (EB1-C84-GFP) displayed profound defects in microtubule organization and centrosomal anchoring. EB1-C84-GFP expression severely inhibited microtubule regrowth, focusing, and anchoring in transfected cells during recovery from nocodazole treatment. The recruitment of gamma-tubulin and p150(Glued) to centrosomes was also inhibited. None of these effects were seen in cells expressing the last 50 aa of EB1 fused to GFP. Furthermore, EB1-C84-GFP expression did not induce Golgi apparatus fragmentation. We propose that a functional interaction between EB1 and p150(Glued) is required for microtubule minus end anchoring at centrosomes during the assembly and maintenance of a radial microtubule array.
7749328	Mutations in the APC gene and their implications for protein structure and function.	An enormous number of germline and somatic mutations have been identified in the APC tumor suppressor gene. Nearly all of these mutations result in premature polypeptide chain termination, but the consequences to APC protein function are unknown. Recent advances, including the identification of an oligomerization domain, the localization of several beta-catenin binding sites, some of which down-regulate beta-catenin in vivo, and the identification of a microtubule-binding domain in the carboxy-terminal region of APC, are beginning to provide some clues.
8034742	Actin mutations that show suppression with fimbrin mutations identify a likely fimbrin-binding site on actin.	Actin interacts with a large number of different proteins that modulate its assembly and mediate its functions. One such protein is the yeast actin-binding protein Sac6p, which is homologous to vertebrate fimbrin (Adams, A. E. M., D. Botstein, and D. G. Drubin. 1991. Nature (Lond.). 354:404-408.). Sac6p was originally identified both genetically (Adams, A. E. M., and D. Botstein. 1989. Genetics. 121:675-683.) by dominant, reciprocal suppression of a temperature-sensitive yeast actin mutation (act1-1), as well as biochemically (Drubin, D. G., K. G. Miller, and D. Botstein. 1988. J. Cell Biol. 107: 2551-2561.). To identify the region on actin that interacts with Sac6p, we have analyzed eight different act1 mutations that show suppression with sac6 mutant alleles, and have asked whether (a) these mutations occur in a small defined region on the crystal structure of actin; and (b) the mutant actins are defective in their interaction with Sac6p in vitro. Sequence analysis indicates that all of these mutations change residues that cluster in the small domain of the actin crystal structure, suggesting that this region is an important part of the Sac6p-binding domain. Biochemical analysis reveals defects in the ability of several of the mutant actins to bind Sac6p, and a reduction in Sac6p-induced cross-linking of mutant actin filaments. Together, these observations identify a likely site of interaction of fimbrin on actin.
8955143	D3 phosphoinositides and outside-in integrin signaling by glycoprotein IIb-IIIa mediate platelet actin assembly and filopodial extension induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.	Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) uncaps a small number of the fast-growing (barbed) ends of actin filaments, thereby eliciting slow actin assembly and extension of filopodia in human blood platelets. These reactions, which also occur in response to immunologic perturbation of the integrin glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa, are sensitive to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Platelets deficient in GPIIb-IIIa integrins or with GPIIb-IIIa function inhibited by calcium chelation or the peptide RGDS have diminished PMA responsiveness. The effects of PMA contrast with thrombin receptor stimulation by >/=5 microM thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP), which causes rapid and massive wortmannin-insensitive actin assembly and lamellar and filopodial extension. However, we show here that wortmannin can inhibit filopod formation if the thrombin receptor is ligated using suboptimal doses (<1 microM) of TRAP. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate inhibits actin filament severing and capping by human gelsolin in vitro. The findings implicate D3 polyphosphoinositides and integrin signaling in PMA-mediated platelet stimulation and implicate D3 containing phosphoinositides generated in response to protein kinase C activation and GPIIb-IIIa signaling as late-acting intermediates leading to filopodial actin assembly.
9139873	Mouse fibroblast activation protein: molecular cloning, alternative splicing and expression in the reactive stroma of epithelial cancers.	The growth of solid neoplasms requires the recruitment of a supporting stroma. In most epithelial cancers, this stromal compartment comprises newly formed blood vessels and abundant, reactive stromal fibroblasts. Tumor stromal fibroblasts are not transformed but differ from resting fibrocytes in normal adult tissues by an altered pattern of gene expression. In human cancers, this includes induction of the cell-surface-bound fibroblast-activation protein (FAP), a member of the serine protease family encoded by the FAP gene on chromosome 2. In this study, we have cloned a complementary DNA for Fap, the murine homologue of FAP. The predicted murine FAP protein, mFAP, shares 89% amino-acid-sequence identity with human FAP, including a perfectly conserved catalytic triad. Cultured mouse embryo fibroblasts and mouse embryonic tissues were found to express Fap transcripts. In addition, the host-derived, fibroblast-rich stroma of human epithelial-cancer xenografts grown in immunodeficient mice also expresses Fap. Sequencing of reverse-transcription-PCR products indicates that 3 distinct Fap splice variants can be detected in tissues. Our findings suggest a close similarity in structure and tissue expression of FAP in different species. By extending the analysis of FAP to the mouse, new in vivo test systems become available for genetic and therapeutic manipulations and for the study of FAP regulation and function in embryonic development and in epithelial cancers.
10445562	Gastric adenocarcinoma associated with fundic gland polyps in a patient with attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis.	Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a rare autosomal dominant precancerous condition of the colon caused by mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene. FAP is characterized by the appearance of innumerable adenomatous polyps throughout the large bowel. Fundic gland polyps are the most common gastric lesion in FAP. It is generally believed that fundic gland polyps have little or no potential for malignant transformation in the population at large, and only a few case reports describe the development of high grade dysplasia or gastric adenocarcinoma associated with diffuse fundic gland polyposis in patients with FAP. We report the second case of gastric adenocarcinoma intimately associated with fundic gland polyposis in a family with an attenuated form of FAP. The patient had undergone routine screening per current guidelines because of his known mutation in the APC gene. This suggests that malignant transformation of fundic gland polyps in patients with FAP occur more frequently than previously believed. Current screening recommendations may not be sufficient for patients with FAP or its attenuated forms.
11099951	The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour suppressor--genetics, function and disease.	Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are the basis of familial adenomatous polyposis and the majority of sporadic colorectal cancer. APC is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, interacts with the cytoskeleton, is involved in regulating levels of beta-catenin and, most recently, has been shown to bind DNA, suggesting that it may possess a nuclear role. The mutation spectrum implicated in tumorigenesis and its correlation with disease phenotype is well characterized and has contributed to our understanding of important functional domains in APC. Despite these advances, APC continues to provide a fertile subject of research for both colorectal tumorigenesis and cancer in general.
11157977	Apical membrane localization of the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor protein and subcellular distribution of the beta-catenin destruction complex in polarized epithelial cells.	The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein is implicated in the majority of hereditary and sporadic colon cancers. APC is known to function as a tumor suppressor through downregulation of beta-catenin as part of a high molecular weight complex known as the beta-catenin destruction complex. The molecular composition of the intact complex and its site of action in the cell are still not well understood. Reports on the subcellular localization of APC in various cell systems have differed significantly and have been consistent with an association with a cytosolic complex, with microtubules, with the nucleus, or with the cortical actin cytoskeleton. To better understand the role of APC and the destruction complex in colorectal cancer, we have begun to characterize and isolate these complexes from confluent polarized human colon epithelial cell monolayers and other epithelial cell types. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy reveal that a predominant fraction of APC associates tightly with the apical plasma membrane in a variety of epithelial cell types. This apical membrane association is not dependent on the mutational status of either APC or beta-catenin. An additional pool of APC is cytosolic and fractionates into two distinct high molecular weight complexes, 20S and 60S in size. Only the 20S fraction contains an appreciable portion of the cellular axin and small but detectable amounts of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta and beta-catenin. Therefore, it is likely to correspond to the previously characterized beta-catenin destruction complex. Dishevelled is almost entirely cytosolic, but does not significantly cofractionate with the 20S complex. The disproportionate amount of APC in the apical membrane and the lack of other destruction complex components in the 60S fraction of APC raise questions about whether these pools of APC take part in the degradation of beta-catenin, or alternatively, whether they could be involved in other functions of the protein that still must be determined.
11257105	The ABC of APC.	Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease characterized by the presence of adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum, with inevitable development of colorectal cancer if left untreated. FAP is caused by germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Somatic mutations in the APC gene are an early event in colorectal tumorigenesis, and can be detected in the majority of colorectal tumours. The APC gene encodes a large protein with multiple cellular functions and interactions, including roles in signal transduction in the wnt-signalling pathway, mediation of intercellular adhesion, stabilization of the cytoskeleton and possibly regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis. The fact that APC is an integral part of so many different pathways makes it an ideal target for mutation in carcinogenesis. This review deals with our understanding to date of how mutations in the APC gene translate into changes at the protein level, which in turn contribute to the role of APC in tumorigenesis.
11564752	Where is APC going?	Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein has been thought to function as a tumor suppressor through its involvement in the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. However, its connections to the cytoskeleton and microtubules in particular are becoming apparent, and the discovery of these new functions for APC is leading to a reevaluation of its role not only in tumorigenesis, but also in normal physiology.
11912492	Identification of a link between the tumour suppressor APC and the kinesin superfamily.	The tumour suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is mutated in sporadic and familial colorectal tumours. APC is involved in the proteasome-mediated degradation of beta-catenin, through its interaction with beta-catenin, GSK-3 beta and Axin. APC also interacts with the microtubule cytoskeleton and has been localized to clusters near the distal ends of microtubules at the edges of migrating epithelial cells. Moreover, in Xenopus laevis epithelial cells, APC has been shown to move along microtubules and accumulate at their growing plus ends. However, the mechanism of APC accumulation and the nature of these APC clusters remain unknown. We show here that APC interacts with the kinesin superfamily (KIF) 3A-KIF3B proteins, microtubule plus-end-directed motor proteins, through an association with the kinesin superfamily-associated protein 3 (KAP3). The interaction of APC with KAP3 was required for its accumulation in clusters, and mutant APCs derived from cancer cells were unable to accumulate efficiently in clusters. These results suggest that APC and beta-catenin are transported along microtubules by KAP3-KIF3A-KIF3B, accumulate in the tips of membrane protrusions, and may thus regulate cell migration.
12504226	Adenomatous polyposis coli truncation alters cytoskeletal structure and microtubule stability in early intestinal tumorigenesis.	Partial loss of function of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein by truncation of its carboxy (C)-terminus is an early factor in the development of many sporadic colorectal cancers. In the C57BL/6J Min/+ (Min/+) mouse, an animal with a germline mutation of Apc, we found that APC truncation was associated with reduced enterocyte migration and loss of association and membrane expression of adherens junction proteins. We hypothesized that these defects were related to changes in cytoskeletal function resulting from truncation of the APC C-terminus, which contains microtubule binding regions, as well as putative sites for indirect actin binding. We investigated this further by determining whether APC truncation produced in vivo changes in actin cytoskeletal structure and microtubule stability. The actin cytoskeleton of histologically normal enterocytes from Min/+ mice was compared to that of Apc+/+ (wild-type) mice by confocal indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. We found a significant loss of actin localization at the apical plasma membrane in Min/+ enterocytes. In addition, immunoblotting revealed increased levels of both unstable Tyr-tubulin and alpha-tubulin turnover in Min/+ enterocytes, indicating an alteration in microtubule dynamics. These studies suggest that loss of actin localization and changes in microtubule dynamics may be dominant negative effects of truncated APC. These changes are consistent with the defects in enterocyte migration and junctional complex formation observed in the Min/+ model of early APC-associated colorectal tumorigenesis.
8608492	Cranial desmoid tumor associated with homozygous inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene in a 2-year-old girl with familial adenomatous polyposis.	"BACKGROUND: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a dominantly inherited disorder characterized by the presence of more than 100 adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum starting in the second decade of life. FAP is associated with extra colonic manifestations, including desmoid tumors. METHODS: A 2-year-old girl presented with a rapidly enlarging tumor of the forehead and a family history of FAP. The tumor was cultured for cytogenetic studies. A DNA linkage study using flanking and intragenic polymorphisms of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene was performed to identify the allele loss in the tumor. Germline mutation identification was by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exon 15 of the APC gene, with subsequent double stranded sequencing of fragments with conformational changes. A mutation-induced loss of a restriction site was used to confirm allele loss in the tumor. RESULTS: Microscopically, the tumor had desmoid features. Cytogenetic analysis of the tumor demonstrated loss of chromosome region 5(q21q22). A truncating adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutation was identified in the leukocyte DNA from the child and her affected father. Linked DNA markers suggested that the tumor had lost the maternal, wild-type allele. A mutation-induced restriction endonuclease site alteration demonstrated hemizygosity of the mutant sequence in the tumor DNA. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are compatible with the presence of a ""second hit"" inactivation of the APC gene and implicate this gene in the pathogenesis of desmoid tumors."
8806074	Cadherin-catenin complex: protein interactions and their implications for cadherin function.	Cadherins comprise a family of calcium-dependent glycoproteins that function in mediating cell-cell adhesion in virtually all solid tissues of multicellular organisms. In epithelial cells, E-cadherin represents a key molecule in the establishment and stabilization of cellular junctions. On the cellular level, E-cadherin is concentrated at the adherens junction and interacts homophilically with E-cadherin molecules of adjacent cells. Significant progress has been made in understanding the extra- and intracellular interactions of E-cadherin. Recent success in solving the three-dimensional structure of an extracellular cadherin domain provides a structural basis for understanding the homophilic interaction mechanism and the calcium requirement of cadherins. According to the crystal structure, individual cadherin molecules cooperate to form a linear cell adhesion zipper. The intracellular anchorage of cadherins is regulated by the dynamic association with cytoplasmic proteins, termed catenins. The cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin is complexed with either beta-catenin or plakoglobin (gamma-catenin). Beta-catenin and plakoglobin bind directly to alpha-catenin, giving rise to two distinct cadherin-catenin complexes (CCC). Alpha-catenin is thought to link both CCC's to actin filaments. The anchorage of cadherins to the cytoskeleton appears to be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Phosphorylation-induced junctional disassembly targets the catenins, indicating that catenins are components of signal transduction pathways. The unexpected association of catenins with the product of the tumor suppressor gene APC has led to the discovery of a second, cadherin-independent catenin complex. Two separate catenin complexes are therefore involved in the cross-talk between cell adhesion and signal transduction. In this review we focus on protein interactions regulating the molecular architecture and function of the CCC. In the light of a fundamental role of the CCC during mammalian development and tissue morphogenesis, we also discuss the phenotypes of embryos lacking E-cadherin or beta-catenin.
8978821	Actin and myosin function in directed vacuole movement during cell division in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	During cell division, cytoplasmic organelles are not synthesized de novo, rather they are replicated and partitioned between daughter cells. Partitioning of the vacuole in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is coordinated with the cell cycle and involves a dramatic translocation of a portion of the parental organelle from the mother cell into the bud. While the molecular mechanisms that mediate this event are unknown, the vacuole's rapid and directed movements suggest cytoskeleton involvement. To identify cytoskeletal components that function in this process, vacuole inheritance was examined in a collection of actin mutants. Six strains were identified as being defective in vacuole inheritance. Tetrad analysis verified that the defect cosegregates with the mutant actin gene. One strain with a deletion in a myosin-binding region was analyzed further. The vacuole inheritance defect in this strain appears to result from the loss of a specific actin function; the actin cytoskeleton is intact and protein targeting to the vacuole is normal. Consistent with these findings, a mutation in the actin-binding domain of Myo2p, a class V unconventional myosin, abolishes vacuole inheritance. This suggests that Myo2p serves as a molecular motor for vacuole transport along actin filaments. The location of actin and Myo2p relative to the vacuole membrane is consistent with this model. Additional studies suggest that the actin filaments used for vacuole transport are dynamic, and that profilin plays a critical role in regulating their assembly. These results present the first demonstration that specific cytoskeletal proteins function in vacuole inheritance.
9296069	Colon cancer. Molecular biology of the APC protein.	The discovery of a tumor suppressor gene opens a new pathway to discovery of the fundamental mechanisms that underlie tumor initiation and progression. An inherited tumor suppressor gene is of special interest in that it defines a step in the tumorigenesis pathway that can be rate limiting in development of that tumor type. In the case of colon cancer, we were fortunate in identifying an inherited tumor suppressor gene, the APC gene, that plays a major etiologic role in both the inherited disease, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), and in sporadic colon polyps. Characterization of the molecular biology of that gene, and the underlying mechanisms that result in the development of colon tumors, could provide new approaches to both colon cancer diagnostics, therapeutics and chemopreventives. We have embarked, therefore, on a series of exploratory studies designed to provides clues to possible functional roles for the APC protein. We have found through immunocytochemistry that APC protein is distributed throughout the cell, in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, within the nucleus much of the APC protein seems associated with the nucleoli. The cytoplasmic label is distributed in a punctate pattern, with concentrations at the leading edge of migrating cells at the ends of microtubules. Furthermore, following an extraction of the cells that leaves behind primarily cytoskeletal and nuclear scaffold structures, we see strong APC staining of these structures. The yeast two-hybrid system has offered a number of potentially interacting partners for APC, including a new binding site for alpha-tubulin. These results, and others recent discoveries concerning APC, suggest a rather global role for APC protein, modulating cellular activity and signal transduction pathway from the cell periphery to the nucleus.
9330872	Cadherins, catenins and APC protein: interplay between cytoskeletal complexes and signaling pathways.	Cadherins play important roles in cell-cell adhesion during tissue differentiation. Cadherins are linked to the actin cytoskeleton by catenins (beta-catenin/armadillo, plakoglobin, and alpha-catenin). Recent results show that beta-catenin also binds to another cytoskeletal complex containing the adenomatous polyposis coli protein and microtubules, and interacts with several signaling pathways that include tyrosine kinases and phosphatases and Wnt/Wingless. Interplay between these cytoskeletal complexes and signaling pathways may regulate morphogenesis.
9382065	Familial juvenile polyposis coli with APC gene mutation.	Familial juvenile polyposis has been known to have malignant potential, but their genetic relation to familial adenomatous polyposis has not been proven yet. Two young brothers with intermittent rectal bleeding revealed multiple juvenile polyposis. Their father had a history of rectal cancer with multiple colonic polyps. Four frequent exons of APC gene mutation were tested from these patients' white blood cells by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The 21-yr-old brother had a missense mutation (GAA-->GGA) at codon 1309, whereas the 18-yr-old brother showed a missense mutation (ATA-->GTA) at codon 1304 in exon 15 of APC gene. Three of four first-degree relatives were affected with familial juvenile polyposis, familial juvenile polyposis with adenomatous change, and rectal cancer with multiple polyps. The APC gene mutation of familial juvenile polyposis in this case suggests a genetic relationship with familial adenomatous polyposis.
9919881	[Tumor suppressor genes with special emphasis on the APC tumor suppressor gene].	Tumor suppressor genes play a central role in the genesis and progression of human cancers. Genetic alterations of tumor suppressor genes have been found in a variety of hereditary and nonhereditary cancers. Persons that carry a hereditary mutation in tumor suppressor genes are strongly predisposed to one or more kinds of cancer. This review brings current developments in the field of tumor suppressor genes. Special emphasis is dedicated to recently discovered tumor suppressor gene APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) whose mutations are responsible for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). The known mutations of the APC gene are described. The role of the APC gene in tumor development, as well as the possibility for presymptomatic genetic testing is also discussed in the paper.
11137023	Actin dynamics: assembly and disassembly of actin networks.	Assembly of branched actin filament networks at the leading edge of migrating cells requires stimulation of the Arp2/3 complex by WASp proteins, in concert with the WASp activators Cdc42, PIP(2) and profilin. Network disassembly and debranching appears to be linked to actin-bound ATP hydrolysis as filaments age.
11345521	Molecular strategies for fimbrial expression and assembly.	Fimbriae or pili are long, filamentous, multimeric macromolecules found on the bacterial cell surface. Bacteria express a diverse array of fimbriae or pili that are involved in bacterial adherence and invasion. Fimbriae can be categorized based on their modes of expression and assembly. Type I fimbriae and P pili are distributed peritrichously and translocated to the cell surface by a chaperone/usher pathway. Type 4 pili are located at the pole of the cell and assembled via the type II secretion system. Curli fimbriae are coiled surface structures assembled by an extracellular nucleation/precipitation pathway. Fimbriae of oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria have not been well-studied as compared with the fimbriae of enteric pathogens. Oral pathogens, such as Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, possess fimbriae that have been implicated in bacterial adhesion and invasion. These fimbriae are potential virulence factors in oral infectious processes. A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. corrodens have Type 4-like fimbriae, whereas P. gingivalis displays a unique type of fimbriae. To date, fimbriae of the oral primary colonizers, Actinomyces naeslundii and Streptococcus parasanguis, represent the only fimbriae characterized for any gram-positive bacteria. The putative major fimbrial subunits, FimA and FimP of A. naeslundii and Fap1 of S. parasanguis, contain a signal sequence and cell-wall-sorting signal. The presence of extensive dipeptide repeats in Fap1 makes it unique among fimbrial molecules. Based on experimental data, a nucleation/precipitation pathway is proposed for fimbrial biogenesis of both S. parasanguis and A. naeslundii, although we cannot rule out an alternative covalent linkage model. The model systems described in this review served as a framework for hypotheses for how the known molecular factors of fimbriae on oral bacteria may be expressed and assembled.
11470413	Critical role for the EB1 and APC interaction in the regulation of microtubule polymerization.	Human EB1 was originally cloned as a protein that interacts with the COOH terminus of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Interestingly, this interaction is often disrupted in colon cancer, due to mutations in APC. EB1 also interacts with the plus-ends of microtubules and targets APC to microtubule tips. Since APC is detected on the kinetochores of chromosomes, it has been hypothesized that the EB1-APC interaction connects microtubule spindles to the kinetochores and regulates microtubule stability. In yeast, EB1 regulates microtubule dynamics, and its binding domain in APC may be conserved in Kar9, an EB1 binding protein involved in the microtubule-capturing mechanism. These results suggest that the interaction of EB1 and APC is important and may be conserved. However, it is largely unknown whether the EB1-APC interaction affects microtubule dynamics. Here, we show that EB1 potently promotes microtubule polymerization in vitro and in permeabilized cells, but, surprisingly, only in the presence of the COOH-terminal EB1 binding domain of APC (C-APC). Significantly, this C-APC activity is abolished by phosphorylation, which also disrupts its ability to bind to EB1. Furthermore, yeast EB1 protein effectively substitutes for the human protein but also requires C-APC in promoting microtubule polymerization. Finally, C-APC is able to promote microtubule polymerization when stably expressed in APC mutant cells, demonstrating the ability of C-APC to promote microtubule assembly in vivo. Thus, the interaction between EB1 and APC plays an essential role in the regulation of microtubule polymerization, and a similar mechanism may be conserved in yeast.
12871644	DOCK2 is essential for antigen-induced translocation of TCR and lipid rafts, but not PKC-theta and LFA-1, in T cells.	DOCK2 is a mammalian homolog of Caenorhabditis elegans CED-5 and Drosophila melanogaster Myoblast City which are known to regulate actin cytoskeleton. DOCK2 is critical for lymphocyte migration, yet the role of DOCK2 in TCR signaling remains unclear. We show here that DOCK2 is essential for TCR-mediated Rac activation and immunological synapse formation. In DOCK2-deficient T cells, antigen-induced translocation of TCR and lipid rafts, but not PKC-theta and LFA-1, to the APC interface was severely impaired, resulting in a significant reduction of antigen-specific T cell proliferation. In addition, we found that the efficacy of both positive and negative selection was reduced in DOCK2-deficient mice. These results suggest that DOCK2 regulates T cell responsiveness through remodeling of actin cytoskeleton via Rac activation.
7557972	A novel coding exon of the human adenomatous polyposis coli gene.	We report the genomic cloning and sequence analysis of a novel and (so far) smallest coding exon of the human adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. This additional exon of 54 nucleotides in length, designated APC exon 10A, is located 1.6 kb downstream from exon 10. It resides on a 0.5-kb genomic EcoRI restriction fragment. APC exon 10A is alternatively spliced and inserted in-frame into mature transcripts; it gives an APC protein with an additional 18 amino acids. This highly conserved exon is expressed in a tissue-independent fashion. APC exon 10A flanking sequences are presented so that this novel exon can be included in future mutation screening procedures.
7613464	Homology model of human interferon-alpha 8 and its receptor complex.	Human interferon-alpha 8 (HuIFN alpha 8), a type I interferon (IFN), is a cytokine belonging to the hematopoietic super-family that includes human growth hormone (HGH). Recent data identified two human type I IFN receptor components. One component (p40) was purified from human urine by its ability to bind to immobilized type I IFN. A second receptor component (IFNAR), consisting of two cytokine receptor-like domains (D200 and D200'), was identified by expression cloning. Murine cells transfected with a gene encoding this protein were able to produce an antiviral response to human IFN alpha 8. Both of these receptor proteins have been identified as members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of which HGH receptor is a member. The cytokine receptor-like structural motifs present in p40 and IFNAR were modeled based on the HGH receptor X-ray structure. Models of the complexes of HuIFN alpha 8 with the receptor subunits were built by superpositioning the conserved C alpha backbone of the HuIFN alpha 8 and receptor subunit models with HGH and its receptor complex. The HuIFN alpha 8 model was constructed from the C alpha coordinates of murine interferon-beta crystal structure. Electrostatic potentials and hydrophobic interactions appear to favor the model of HuIFN alpha 8 interacting with p40 at site 1 and the D200' domain of IFNAR at site 2 because there are regions of complementary electrostatic potential and hydrophobic interactions at both of the proposed binding interfaces. Some of the predicted receptor binding residues within HuIFN alpha 8 correspond to functionally important residues determined previously for human IFN alpha 1, IFN alpha 2, and IFN alpha 4 subtypes by site-directed mutagenesis studies. The models predict regions of interaction between HuIFN alpha 8 and each of the receptor proteins, and provide insights into interactions between other type I IFNs (IFN-alpha subtypes and IFN-beta) and their respective receptor components.
7989744	Antigen presentation and assembly by mouse I-Ak class II molecules in human APC containing deleted or mutated HLA DM genes.	The behavior of mouse I-Ak molecules was studied in the human Ag presentation mutants T2 and 9.5.3, which contain deleted or mutated HLA DM genes. HLA class II molecules expressed by these APC are defective in presentation of native Ag and are mostly complexed with class II-associated invariant chain peptides (CLIP). In contrast to human class II molecules, a significant proportion of mouse I-Ak molecules expressed in T2 and 9.5.3 were associated with antigenic peptides, indicating that I-Ak/peptide assembly is possible in the absence of the Dm proteins. Thus, the presentation of determinants derived from hen egg lysozyme (HEL), keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and conalbumin was normal in 9.5.3Ak and a conalbumin determinant was presented normally by T2.Ak. However, the keyhole limpet hemocyanin determinant was not presented by T2.Ak, and HEL46-61 was only presented at a low level by these APC. SDS-stable, dimeric I-Ak molecules were expressed by both T2.Ak and 9.5.3Ak and formed late in their intracellular transport. Presentation of HEL46-61 was partially inhibited by disrupting vacuolar acidification in 9.5.3Ak, consistent with I-Ak/peptide assembly in a post-Golgi endosomal compartment. Accordingly, Dm is not an obligatory requirement for MHC class II/peptide assembly. We propose that Dm influences the displacement of CLIP from recently synthesized class II molecules, a process that is likely to be less critical for I-Ak because of its low affinity for CLIP.
8167016	The yeast actin cytoskeleton.	Budding and fission yeast present significant advantages for studies of the actin cytoskeleton. The application of classical and molecular genetic techniques provides a facile route for the analysis of structure/function relationships, for the isolation of novel proteins involved in cytoskeletal function, and for deciphering the signals that regulate actin assembly in vivo. This review focuses on the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and also identifies some recent advances from studies on the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, for which studies on the actin cytoskeleton are still in their infancy.
9654054	A domain within the tumor suppressor protein APC shows very similar biochemical properties as the microtubule-associated protein tau.	The tumor-suppressor protein APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) binds to microtubules and promotes tubulin assembly. In vivo the endogenous APC protein is mainly localized at the end of microtubules that are involved in active cell migration. Since most tumor-specific APC gene mutations lead to the loss of the microtubule binding domain this interaction is assumed to play a crucial role in tumorigenesis. In this study we show that an APC protein fragment (amino acids 2219-2580) within the C-terminal part is enough to bind to non-assembled tubulin with high affinity. The binding of APC to tubulin does not lead to an alteration of the intrinsic GTPase activity of the non-assembled tubulin. The APC protein induces the tubulin assembly in a fast reaction and below the critical assembly concentration of tubulin. The APC protein induces the bundling of the assembled microtubules in a concentration-dependent manner. Regarding its biochemical properties the analysed APC protein fragment strikingly resembles the members of the microtubule-associated protein family tau. This analogy may help to understand the role of the APC protein in the suppression of tumorigenesis.
10021369	Identification of APC2, a homologue of the adenomatous polyposis coli tumour suppressor.	The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour-suppressor protein controls the Wnt signalling pathway by forming a complex with glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta), axin/conductin and betacatenin. Complex formation induces the rapid degradation of betacatenin. In colon carcinoma cells, loss of APC leads to the accumulation of betacatenin in the nucleus, where it binds to and activates the Tcf-4 transcription factor (reviewed in [1] [2]). Here, we report the identification and genomic structure of APC homologues. Mammalian APC2, which closely resembles APC in overall domain structure, was functionally analyzed and shown to contain two SAMP domains, both of which are required for binding to conductin. Like APC, APC2 regulates the formation of active betacatenin-Tcf complexes, as demonstrated using transient transcriptional activation assays in APC -/- colon carcinoma cells. Human APC2 maps to chromosome 19p13.3. APC and APC2 may therefore have comparable functions in development and cancer.
10744763	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-driven actin-based motility is mediated by VEGFR2 and requires concerted activation of stress-activated protein kinase 2 (SAPK2/p38) and geldanamycin-sensitive phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase.	In endothelial cells, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces an accumulation of stress fibers associated with new actin polymerization and rapid formation of focal adhesions at the ventral surface of the cells. This cytoskeletal reorganization results in an intense motogenic activity. Using porcine endothelial cells expressing one or the other type of the VEGF receptors, VEGFR1 or VEGFR2, or human umbilical vein endothelial cells pretreated with a VEGFR2 neutralizing antibody, we show that VEGFR2 is responsible for VEGF-induced activation of the stress-activated protein kinase-2/p38 (SAPK2/p38), phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and enhanced migratory activity. Activation of SAPK2/p38 triggered actin polymerization whereas FAK, which was phosphorylated independently of SAPK2/p38, initiated assembly of focal adhesions. Both processes contributed to the formation of stress fibers. Geldanamycin, an inhibitor of HSP90 blocked tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, assembly of focal adhesions, actin reorganization, and cell migration, all of which were reversed by overexpressing HSP90. We conclude that VEGFR2 mediates the physiological effect of VEGF on cell migration and that two independent pathways downstream of VEGFR2 regulate actin-based motility. One pathway involves SAPK2/p38 and leads to enhanced actin polymerization activity. The other involves HSP90 as a permissive signal transduction factor implicated in FAK phosphorylation and assembly of focal adhesions.
11691822	Human APC2 localization and allelic imbalance.	A second adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-like gene, APC2/APCL, was recently described and localized to chromosome 19. We have fine mapped APC2 to a small region of chromosome 19p13.3 containing markers D19S883 and WI-19632, a region commonly lost in a variety of cancers, particularly ovarian cancer. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed an APC2 allelic imbalance in 19 of 20 ovarian cancers screened and indicates that APC2 could be a potential tumor suppressor gene in ovarian cancer. When overexpressed in SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells, which express low levels of APC2, exogenous APC2 localized to the Golgi apparatus, actin-containing structures, and occasionally to microtubules. Antibodies against the NH2 terminus of human APC2 show that endogenous APC2 is diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and colocalizes with both the Golgi apparatus and actin filaments. APC2 remained associated with actin filaments after treatment with the actin-disrupting agent, cytochalasin D. These results suggest that APC2 is involved in actin-associated events and could influence cell motility or adhesion through interaction with actin filaments, as well as functioning independently or in cooperation with APC to down-regulate beta-catenin signaling.
12444111	Live-cell dynamics and the role of costimulation in immunological synapse formation.	Using transfected fibroblasts expressing both wild-type I-E(k) and green fluorescent protein-tagged I-E(k) with covalently attached antigenic peptide, we have monitored movement of specific MHC:peptide complexes during CD4(+) T cell-APC interactions by live-cell video microscopy. Ag recognition occurs within 30 s of T cell-APC contact, as shown by a sharp increase in cytoplasmic calcium ion concentration. Within 1 min, small MHC:peptide clusters form in the contact zone that coalesce into an immunological synapse over 3-20 min. When T cells conjugated to APC move across the APC surface, they appear to drag the synapse with them. This system was used to examine the role of costimulation in the formation of the immunological synapse. Blocking CD80/CD28 or ICAM-1/LFA-1 interactions alters synapse morphology and reduces the area and density of accumulated complexes. These reductions correlate with reduced T cell proliferation, while CD69 and CD25 expression and TCR down-modulation remain unaffected. Thus, costimulation is essential for normal mature immunological synapse formation.
7747022	[New strategies in the clinical evaluation of patients with colon cancer based on molecular studies].	During the last five years molecular studies allowed important advances in the knowledge of cancer colon with important clinical implications. The main finding was the identification and sequence analysis of the APC gen. Structural alterations of this gene have been detected in patients with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis and Gardner syndrome, which suggest a common disease. Furthermore, alterations of the APC gen appears to be also altered in cases of cancer of colon sporadic. Indicating that structural alteration of the APC gen can be inherited and/or acquired. Restriction fragment-length polymorphisms in the chromosome 5q21-22 can now be used clinically for premorbid diagnosis and counseling in familial adenomatous polyposis. The molecular studies allow the clinician to have a new approach in the management and screening of families with familial adenomatous polyposis. The sequence analysis and specific identification of the structural alteration of the APC gene is a more expensive and sophisticated study, although represent a more direct approach. In the Department of Gastroenterology of the INNSZ we are performing such molecular studies. The main purpose of our group is to proportionate integral clinical-molecular studies for families with hereditary colon cancer, create a national register of these diseases and investigate the molecular bases in order to generate new molecular diagnosis tools.
8920656	[The APC gene].	The tumor suppressor gene APC is mutated in most cases of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and sporadic colorectal tumors. The product of the APC gene is a 300 kDa protein present in the cytoplasm as a homodimer. Interestingly, the APC protein is known to interact with the adherence junction protein catenin, suggesting that APC may be involved in cell adhesion. More recently we have demonstrated that overexpression of APC blocks cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 to the S phase.
9276697	Recent advances in molecular genetics of colorectal cancer.	Advances in molecular biology have identified two important genes responsible for the hereditary colorectal cancers familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. They are the APC gene and mismatch repair genes. The role of these genes in colorectal carcinogenesis has been studied intensively. The adenoma-carcinoma sequence was initially proposed by Vogelstein, and the multistep carcinogenesis theory is now well accepted. The various functions of the APC gene have been elucidated. APC genes are considered to play a role in shedding of the epithelial cells into the lumen. The mechanism behind formation of a unicryptal adenoma is now better understood. Adenoma formation is a monoclonal event with two hits of the APCgene. There is no zonal extension of the proliferative zone in the background colonic mucosa of FAP patients. In addition to the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, there seem to be various carcinogenetic pathways in the development of colorectal cancer. A depressed type of early cancer was recently found by the use of magnifying endoscopy. The incidence of K-ras mutation was extremely low in this group of early cancers. Some of the minute cancers show the p53mutation before the occurrence of APC mutation. Cancers of microsatellite mutator phenotype show exaggerated genomic instability at simple repeat sequences, such as TGFbetaRII. These genes may play a suppressor role in a p53 independent pathway of colorectal carcinogenesis. We are now in an exciting era of this progressing field of science. This genetic information may be more widely applicable clinically in the near future (e.g., for presymptomatic diagnosis, selection of patients for the most appropriate treatments, and assessment of malignant potential).
10232926	Subpopulations of tau interact with microtubules and actin filaments in various cell types.	It has been demonstrated that microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) interact with tubulin in vitro and in vivo. However, there is no clear evidence on the possible roles of the interactions of MAPs in vivo with other cytoskeletal components in maintaining the integrity of the cell architecture. To address this question we extracted the neuronal cytoskeleton from brain cells and studied the selective  dissociation of specific molecular isospecies of tau protein under various experimental conditions. Tau, and in some cases MPA-2, were analysed by the use of anti-idiotypic antibodies that recognize epitopes on their tubulin binding sites. Fractions of microtubule-bound tau isoforms were extracted with 0.35 M NaCl or after the addition of nocodazole to allow microtubule depolymerization. Protein eluted with this inhibitor contained most of the assembled tubulin dimer pool and part of the remaining tau and MAP-2. When the remaining cytoskeletal pellet was treated with cytochalasin D to allow depolymerization of actin filaments, only tau isoforms were extracted. Immunoprecipitation studies along with immunolocalization experiments in cell lines containing tau-like components supported the findings on the roles of tau isospecies as linkers between tubulin in the microtubular structure with actin filaments. Interestingly, in certain types of cells, antibody-reactive tau isospecies were detected by immunofluorescence with a discrete distribution pattern along actin filaments, which was affected by cytochalasin disruption of the actin filament network. These results suggest the possible in vivo roles of subsets of tau protein in modulating the interactions between microtubules and actin filaments.
10545404	Introduction of full-length APC modulates cyclooxygenase-2 expression in HT-29 human colorectal carcinoma cells at the translational level.	Mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene is associated with the earliest stages of colorectal tumorigenesis and appears to be responsible for the hereditary condition familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Evidence indicates that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is induced and at elevated levels in human colorectal cancers and in the polyps of mouse FAP models. We have used HT-29 cells, a human colorectal carcinoma cell line with a mutant carboxy-truncated APC gene, in which intact APC gene has been introduced under the control of an inducible promoter. These HT-29-APC cells provide a suitable model system to examine how COX-2 expression becomes dysregulated after loss of APC function. Induction of full-length APC causes the HT-29-APC cells to undergo apoptosis. However, differentiation, as measured by alkaline phosphatase activity, is not induced upon expression of full-length APC. Full-length APC protein has been shown to bind the intracellular protein beta-catenin and, as a result, the Lef/Tcf transcription factors are down-regulated. Analysis of APC immunoprecipitates demonstrate a time-dependent increase of beta-catenin interacting with full-length APC. Thus, the Lef/Tcf signaling pathway is intact at this point in these cells. Furthermore, upon expression of full-length APC, COX-2 protein expression is down-regulated while COX-2 mRNA levels remain the same. These data indicate that APC plays a role, either directly or indirectly, in the translational regulation of COX-2. Treatment of the HT-29-APC cells with sodium butyrate, an inducer of apoptosis, does not alter COX-2 protein expression. Thus, COX-2 down-regulation appears to be APC specific and not just due to apoptotic induction. APC appears to uniquely regulate COX-2 expression. The mechanism by which COX-2 protein expression is down-regulated in the HT-29-APC cells is under investigation.
10980114	Fundic gland polyps in familial adenomatous polyposis: neoplasms with frequent somatic adenomatous polyposis coli gene alterations.	Fundic gland polyps (FGPs) are the most common gastric polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). FGPs have traditionally been regarded as nonneoplastic, possibly hamartomatous lesions, but the pathogenesis of FGPs in both FAP and sporadic patients remains unclear. FGPs in FAP can show foveolar dysplasia, and rarely invasive gastric adenocarcinoma has been reported in patients with FAP and fundic gland polyposis. Using direct gene sequencing and allelic loss assays at 5q, we analyzed somatic adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene alterations in 41 FAP-associated FGPs (20 with foveolar dysplasia, six indefinite for dysplasia, and 15 nondysplastic) and 13 sporadic FGPs. The foveolar epithelium and dilated fundic glands of the polyps were separately microdissected and analyzed in 25 of 41 FAP-associated FGPs and 13 of 13 sporadic FGPs. Somatic APC gene alterations were identified frequently (21 of 41 cases, 51%) in FAP-associated FGPs. Both the foveolar epithelium and the dilated fundic gland epithelium comprising the FGPs were shown to carry the same somatic APC gene alteration in 24 (96%) of 25 cases. Furthermore, there was no difference in the frequency of somatic APC gene alterations between FGPs with foveolar dysplasia (10 of 20, 50%), indefinite for dysplasia (four of six, 67%), and nondysplastic (seven of 15, 47%) in FAP patients (P: = 0.697). In contrast, FGPs from non-FAP patients showed infrequent (one of 13, 8%) APC gene alterations (P: = 0.008). These results show that FGPs in FAP patients are pathogenetically distinct from sporadic FGPs. Somatic, second-hit APC gene alterations, which precede morphological dysplasia in many FAP-associated FGPs, indicate that FGPs arising in the setting of FAP are neoplastic lesions.
11123310	Fascin is involved in the antigen presentation activity of mature dendritic cells.	Maturation of dendritic cells (DC) is critical to their development into potent APCs. Upon maturation, DC up-regulate the expression of MHC class II as well as costimulatory and adhesion molecules, all of which are important in Ag presentation. In addition, they undergo structural changes characterized by the expression of numerous long dendrites. Fascin is an actin-bundling protein that has been reported to be important for the development of dendrites. In this study, we evaluated fascin expression and function during DC maturation into potent APC. In vitro, treatment of bone marrow-derived DC (BM-DC) with GM-CSF resulted in increased levels of fascin expression. This increase correlated directly with an increase in MHC class II and B7-2 expression. Fascin expression was decreased by the addition of TGF-ss and increased by the addition TNF-alpha to the culture. These cytokines suppress or enhance DC maturation, respectively. Increased levels of fascin expression were found to correlate with increased APC activity in a one-way MLR. Specific inhibition of fascin expression, using antisense oligonucleotides, markedly reduced this APC allostimulatory activity. These data demonstrate that fascin expression correlates with DC maturation into APC, and it plays a significant role in the ability of DC to function as APC. This observation is the first evidence linking fascin-mediated dendrite formation with the APC activity of DC.
11514192	The adenomatous polyposis coli protein: in the limelight out at the edge.	Truncation mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli protein (APC) are responsible for familial and sporadic colonic tumours. APC is best known for its role in regulating beta-catenin, an important mediator of cell adhesion and a transcriptional activator. However, recent studies indicate that APC has additional roles in cytoskeletal regulation. It binds to microtubules directly and indirectly. Furthermore, indirect connections between APC and the actin cytoskeleton have also been described. Here, we integrate recent information describing the association between APC and the cytoskeleton to illustrate how this multifaceted protein might link different cytoskeletal elements to each other and to cellular signaling pathways.
7806582	E-cadherin and APC compete for the interaction with beta-catenin and the cytoskeleton.	beta-Catenin is involved in the formation of adherens junctions of mammalian epithelia. It interacts with the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin and also with the tumor suppressor gene product APC, and the Drosophila homologue of beta-catenin, armadillo, mediates morphogenetic signals. We demonstrate here that E-cadherin and APC directly compete for binding to the internal, armadillo-like repeats of beta-catenin; the NH2-terminal domain of beta-catenin mediates the interaction of the alternative E-cadherin and APC complexes to the cytoskeleton by binding to alpha-catenin. Plakoglobin (gamma-catenin), which is structurally related to beta-catenin, mediates identical interactions. We thus show that the APC tumor suppressor gene product forms strikingly similar associations as found in cell junctions and suggest that beta-catenin and plakoglobin are central regulators of cell adhesion, cytoskeletal interaction, and tumor suppression.
10491393	Drosophila APC2 is a cytoskeletally-associated protein that regulates wingless signaling in the embryonic epidermis.	The tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) negatively regulates Wingless (Wg)/Wnt signal transduction by helping target the Wnt effector beta-catenin or its Drosophila homologue Armadillo (Arm) for destruction. In cultured mammalian cells, APC localizes to the cell cortex near the ends of microtubules. Drosophila APC (dAPC) negatively regulates Arm signaling, but only in a limited set of tissues. We describe a second fly APC, dAPC2, which binds Arm and is expressed in a broad spectrum of tissues. dAPC2's subcellular localization revealed colocalization with actin in many but not all cellular contexts, and also suggested a possible interaction with astral microtubules. For example, dAPC2 has a striking asymmetric distribution in neuroblasts, and dAPC2 colocalizes with assembling actin filaments at the base of developing larval denticles. We identified a dAPC2 mutation, revealing that dAPC2 is a negative regulator of Wg signaling in the embryonic epidermis. This allele acts genetically downstream of wg, and upstream of arm, dTCF, and, surprisingly, dishevelled. We discuss the implications of our results for Wg signaling, and suggest a role for dAPC2 as a mediator of Wg effects on the cytoskeleton. We also speculate on more general roles that APCs may play in cytoskeletal dynamics.
10572041	Drosophila quail, a villin-related protein, bundles actin filaments in apoptotic nurse cells.	Drosophila Quail protein is required for the completion of fast cytoplasm transport from nurse cells to the oocyte, an event critical for the production of viable oocytes. The abundant network of cytoplasmic filamentous actin, established at the onset of fast transport, is absent in quail mutant egg chambers. Previously, we showed that Quail is a germline-specific protein with sequence homology to villin, a vertebrate actin-regulating protein. In this study, we combined biochemical experiments with observations in egg chambers to define more precisely the function of this protein in the regulation of actin-bundle assembly in nurse cells. We report that recombinant Quail can bind and bundle filamentous actin in vitro in a manner similar to villin at a physiological calcium concentration. In contrast to villin, Quail is unable to sever or cap filamentous actin, or to promote nucleation of new actin filaments at a high calcium concentration. Instead, Quail bundles the filaments regardless of the calcium concentration. In vivo, the assembly of nurse-cell actin bundles is accompanied by extensive perforation of the nurse-cell nuclear envelopes, and both of these phenomena are manifestations of nurse-cell apoptosis. To investigate whether free calcium levels are affected during apoptosis, we loaded egg chambers with the calcium indicator Indo-1. Our observations indicate a rise in free calcium in the nurse-cell cytoplasm coincident with the permeabilization of the nuclear envelopes. We also show that human villin expressed in the Drosophila germline could sense elevated cytoplasmic calcium; in nurse cells with reduced levels of Quail protein, villin interfered with actin-bundle stability. We conclude that Quail efficiently assembles actin filaments into bundles in nurse cells and maintains their stability under fluctuating free calcium levels. We also propose a developmental model for the fast phase of cytoplasm transport incorporating findings presented in this study.
10662776	Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein moves along microtubules and concentrates at their growing ends in epithelial cells.	Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor protein has been shown to be localized near the distal ends of microtubules (MTs) at the edges of migrating cells. We expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fusion proteins with full-length and deletion mutants of Xenopus APC in Xenopus epithelial cells, and observed their dynamic behavior in live cells. During cell spreading and wound healing, GFP-tagged full-length APC was concentrated as granules at the tip regions of cellular extensions. At higher magnification, APC appeared to move along MTs and concentrate as granules at the growing plus ends. When MTs began to shorten, the APC granules dropped off from the MT ends. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that fuzzy structures surrounding MTs were the ultrastructural counterparts for these GFP signals. The COOH-terminal region of APC was targeted to the growing MT ends without forming granular aggregates, and abruptly disappeared when MTs began to shorten. The APC lacking the COOH-terminal region formed granular aggregates that moved along MTs toward their plus ends in an ATP-dependent manner. These findings indicated that APC is a unique MT-associated protein that moves along selected MTs and concentrates at their growing plus ends through their multiple functional domains.
11882996	Val193 and Phe195 of the gamma 1 34.5 protein of herpes simplex virus 1 are required for viral resistance to interferon-alpha/beta.	Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) are resistant to the antiviral action of interferon. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In this report, we show that unlike that of wild-type HSV-1, replication of the gamma 1 34.5 null mutants was significantly inhibited by exogenous interferon-alpha in cells devoid of interferon-alpha/beta genes. Using a series of gamma 1 34.5 deletion mutants, the domain required for interferon resistance was mapped to the region containing amino acids 146 to 263 in the gamma 1 34.5 protein. Interestingly, Val193 Glu and Phe195 Leu substitutions in the protein phosphatase 1 interacting motif of the gamma 1 34.5 protein rendered HSV-1 sensitive to interferon-alpha. Furthermore, gamma 1 34.5 null mutants were sensitive to interferon-alpha/beta in PKR+/+ but not in PKR-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts. These findings provide evidence that the gamma 1 34.5 protein contributes to HSV-1 resistance to interferon-alpha/beta by inhibiting PKR function.
7864589	Age of onset in familial adenomatous polyposis: heterogeneity within families and among APC mutations.	Heterogeneity among and within FAP pedigrees for the age of symptom onset and the age at death from colorectal cancer was studied in a sample of 583 patients of the Italian Polyposis Registry. The among pedigree variation was largely explained by clustering of families in two groups, 'early FAP' (most colorectal cancer deaths below 45 years of age) and 'late FAP' families (most deaths above age 45). The within-family variation was explained by a marked phenomenon of anticipation (15 years per generation, on the average), possibly not due to ascertainment bias. We then considered the pedigrees with identified mutation in the APC gene. Six families shared a common deletion at codon 1309 and showed the early FAP phenotype. Two families shared a mutation at codon 1061 and revealed the late FAP phenotype. Another two families (codons 453 and 302) clustered with the late FAP group, whereas a family with mutation at codon 835 clustered with the early FAP group. We suggest that there are at least two classes of mutations in the APC gene with different consequences at the phenotypic level. It seems that there are several critical points within the APC protein sequence at which truncation causes a more aggressive disease than truncation at other points.
11283619	A role for the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli protein in chromosome segregation.	Mutations in the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) gene are responsible for familial colon cancer and also occur in the early stages of sporadic colon cancer. APC functions in the Wnt signalling pathway to regulate the degradation of beta-catenin (reviewed in refs 1-3). APC also binds to and stabilizes microtubules in vivo and in vitro, localizes to clusters at the ends of microtubules near the plasma membrane of interphase cells, and is an important regulator of cytoskeletal function. Here we show that cells carrying a truncated APC gene (Min) are defective in chromosome segregation. Moreover, during mitosis, APC localizes to the ends of microtubules embedded in kinetochores and forms a complex with the checkpoint proteins Bub1 and Bub3. In vitro, APC is a high-affinity substrate for Bub kinases. Our data are consistent with a role for APC in kinetochore-microtubule attachment and suggest that truncations in APC that eliminate microtubule binding may contribute to chromosomal instability in cancer cells.
11535533	Prostaglandin D2 is a potent chemoattractant for human eosinophils that acts via a novel DP receptor.	Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is released following exposure of asthmatics to allergen and acts via the adenylyl cyclase-coupled receptor for PGD2 (DP receptor). In this study, it is reported that human eosinophils possess this receptor, which would be expected to inhibit their activation. In contrast, it was found that prostaglandin D2 is a potent stimulator of eosinophil chemotaxis, actin polymerization, CD11b expression, and L-selectin shedding. These responses are specific for eosinophils, as neutrophils display little or no response to prostaglandin D2. They were not due to interaction with receptors for other prostanoids, as prostaglandins E2 and F(2alpha), U46619 (a thromboxane A2 analogue), and carbaprostacyclin (a prostacyclin analogue) displayed little or no activity. Furthermore, they were not shared by the selective DP receptor agonist BW245C and were not prevented by the selective DP receptor antagonist BWA868C, indicating that they were not mediated by DP receptors. In contrast, the prostaglandin D2 metabolite 13,14-dihydro-15-oxoprostaglandin D2 induced eosinophil activation but did not stimulate DP receptor-mediated adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) formation. These results indicate that in addition to the classic inhibitory DP1 receptor, eosinophils possess a second, novel DP2 receptor that is associated with PGD2-induced cell activation. These 2 receptors appear to interact to regulate eosinophil responses to PGD2, as blockade of DP1 receptor-mediated cAMP production by BWA868C resulted in enhanced DP2 receptor-mediated stimulation of CD11b expression. The balance between DP1 and DP2 receptors could determine the degree to which prostaglandin D2 can activate eosinophils and may play a role in eosinophil recruitment in asthma.
11694335	Interferon-beta therapy downregulates the anti-apoptosis protein FLIP in T cells from patients with multiple sclerosis.	Interferon-beta reduces clinical exacerbations in multiple sclerosis (MS) through several immunomodulatory mechanisms that may involve augmentation of programmed cell death (apoptosis) of T lymphocytes. The anti-apoptosis protein FLIP (Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitory protein) has been recently identified as a potent regulator of T lymphocyte susceptibility to apoptosis. In a prospective study, we evaluated the expression of FLIP and other apoptosis regulatory proteins in ex vivo activated T lymphocytes from MS patients, before and serially after treatment with interferon-beta. We also investigated the long-term effects of interferon-beta on T cell apoptosis in a cross-sectional study of MS patients receiving chronic drug therapy. Treatment with interferon-beta reduced the expression of FLIP isoforms in activated T lymphocytes. This reduced expression correlated with augmented T cell susceptibility to apoptosis and with clinical response to treatment. In contrast, interferon-beta therapy did not alter cellular expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. This downregulatory effect of interferon-beta on cellular FLIP expression was maintained following long-term therapy. Our findings suggest that interferon-beta therapy exerts a regulatory effect on peripheral T lymphocytes through a pro-apoptosis mechanism that involves the downregulation of cellular FLIP expression.
12628248	Insight into the functional consequences of inherited variants of the hMYH adenine glycosylase associated with colorectal cancer: complementation assays with hMYH variants and pre-steady-state kinetics of the corresponding mutated E.coli enzymes.	"The oxidized guanine lesion 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (OG) is highly mutagenic, resulting in G:C to T:A transversion mutations in the absence of repair. The Escherichia coli adenine glycosylase MutY and its human homolog (hMYH) play an important role in the prevention of mutations associated with OG by removing misincorporated adenine residues from OG:A mismatches. Previously, biallelic mutations of hMYH have been identified in a British family (Family N) with symptoms characteristic of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), which is typically associated with mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Afflicted members of this family were compound heterozygotes for two mutations in hMYH, Y165C and G382D. These positions are highly conserved in MutY across phylogeny. The current work reveals a reduced ability of the hMYH variants compared to wild-type (WT) hMYH to complement the activity of E.coli MutY in mutY((-)) E.coli. In vitro analysis of the corresponding mutations in E.coli MutY revealed a reduction in the adenine glycosylase activity of the enzymes. In addition, evaluation of substrate affinity using a substrate analog, 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoroadenosine (FA) revealed that both mutations severely diminish the ability to recognize FA, and discriminate between OG and G. Importantly, adenine removal with both the mutant and WT E.coli enzymes was observed to be less efficient from a mismatch in the sequence context observed to be predominantly mutated in tumors of Family N. Interestingly, the magnitude of the reduced activity of the E.coli mutant enzymes relative to the WT enzyme was magnified in the ""hotspot"" sequence context. If the corresponding mutations in hMYH cause similar sensitivity to sequence context, this effect may contribute to the specific targeting of the APC gene. The lack of complementation of the hMYH variants for MutY, and the reduced activity of the Y82C and G253D E.coli enzymes, provide additional circumstantial evidence that the somatic mutations in APC, and the occurrence of FAP in Family N, are due to a reduced ability of the Y165C and G382D hMYH enzymes to recognize and repair OG:A mismatches."
8049523	Polymerization of actin in RBL-2H3 cells can be triggered through either the IgE receptor or the adenosine receptor but different signaling pathways are used.	Crosslinking of the IgE receptor on rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells using the multivalent antigen DNP-BSA leads to a rapid and sustained increase in the filamentous actin content of the cells. Stimulation of RBL cells through the adenosine receptor also induces a very rapid polymerization of actin, which peaks in 45-60 s and is equivalent in magnitude to the F-actin response elicited through stimulation of the IgE receptor. However, in contrast to the IgE mediated response, which remains elevated for over 30 min, the F-actin increase induced by the adenosine analogue 5'-(N-ethylcarboxamido)-adenosine (NECA) is relatively transient and returns to baseline values within 5-10 min. While previous work has shown that the polymerization of actin in RBL cells stimulated through the IgE receptor is mediated by protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase inhibitors have no effect on the F-actin response activated through the adenosine receptor. In contrast, pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin completely inhibits the F-actin response to NECA but has relatively little effect on the response induced through the IgE receptor. Stimulation of RBL cells through either receptor causes increased production of phosphatidylinositol mono-phosphate (PIP) and phosphatidylinositol bis-phosphate (PIP2), which correlates with the F-actin response. Production of PIP and PIP2 may be important downstream signals since these polyphosphoinositides are able to regulate the interaction of gelsolin and profilin with actin. Thus the polymerization of actin can be triggered through either the adenosine receptor or the IgE receptor, but different upstream signaling pathways are being used. The IgE mediated response requires the activation of PKC while stimulation through the adenosine receptor is PKC independent but involves a G protein.
8125478	Mutation in a splice-donor site of the APC gene in a family with polyposis and late age of colonic cancer death.	Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by the development of hundreds of colorectal adenomatous polyps during the first decades of life. The expression of the disease varies, as the age of onset of colonic cancer and the severity of extracolonic manifestations often differ between affected families. An attenuated form of APC has also been described in which a small number of polyps and a later age of onset of colonic cancer is observed. Cloning of the APC gene has allowed disease-causing mutations in APC families to be identified. Here, we report a novel splice site mutation (a G to T transversion at position +5 of the splice donor site in intron 9) in the APC gene of affected individuals in an Italian family. Characterization of the transcription products from this mutant APC allele revealed that normal splicing was disrupted: a shorter mRNA was expressed in which exon 8 was connected directly to exon 10. This created a shift in the reading frame and the introduction of a stop codon at position 1358. In addition, some normal APC transcript was produced from the mutant allele in lymphoblastoid cells. A comparison of the clinical features of affected members of this family with four unrelated Italian APC kindreds, in which the same AAAAG deletion at position 3926 has been found, showed a significant difference in the onset of disease symptoms and in the age of death attributable to colorectal cancer. Inefficient exon skipping may be, at least in part, responsible for the delay in the development of the disease in the reported family.
9207294	The clinical correlates of a 3' truncating mutation (codons 1982-1983) in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene.	Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is caused by mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, and different mutations may produce different clinical pictures. Most mutations occur in the 5' half of the gene, and mutations toward the 3' end are rare. The aim of this study was to document the phenotypes in a family with a truncating mutation at codons 1982-1983, one of the most 3' mutations on record. Colonic polyps in this family were much less numerous, and their growth was delayed compared with the classical FAP picture, and malignant degeneration occurred considerably later. Two individuals had sparse colonic but profuse gastric fundic gland polyposis. Gardner's syndrome stigmata were variable, and a desmoid tumor was recorded in 1 person.
9341879	Novel germline mutations in the APC gene and their phenotypic spectrum in familial adenomatous polyposis kindreds.	Among 23 germline mutations identified in the APC screening of 45 familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients, we have found 10 different novel frameshift mutations in 11 apparently unrelated patients. In two cases, an additional missense mutation was detected. One previously described as a causative germline mutation (S2621C), associated with a 1-bp insertion (4684insA) on the opposite allele, did not segregate with the FAP phenotype in the family and was therefore considered as being non-pathogenic. The other (Z1625H) was located 2 codons before a 1-bp deletion (4897delC). Both mutations were transmitted together from an FAP father to his affected son. The FAP phenotype of these 10 novel truncating mutations was clinically documented within their kindreds. Important variability was observed in the phenotype. Interestingly, we noted that a mutation (487insT) localized at the boundary of the 5' attenuated APC phenotype region in two unrelated families resulted in classical polyposis. A clear-cut genotype-phenotype correlation could be drawn in only two instances. In one family, a 4684insA mutation led to a mild polyposis associated with early inherited osteomas and, in the family bearing the double mutation (Z1625H + 4897delC), the phenotype was obviously a 3' attenuated type. Our data illustrate the wide genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of this condition between and within the families, making the establishment of correlations complex and any prediction in this disease difficult, although targeting the mutation site may be helpful in some specific cases.
10491394	Activation of the CDC42 effector N-WASP by the Shigella flexneri IcsA protein promotes actin nucleation by Arp2/3 complex and bacterial actin-based motility.	To propel itself in infected cells, the pathogen Shigella flexneri subverts the Cdc42-controlled machinery responsible for actin assembly during filopodia formation. Using a combination of bacterial motility assays in platelet extracts with Escherichia coli expressing the Shigella IcsA protein and in vitro analysis of reconstituted systems from purified proteins, we show here that the bacterial protein IcsA binds N-WASP and activates it in a Cdc42-like fashion. Dramatic stimulation of actin assembly is linked to the formation of a ternary IcsA-N-WASP-Arp2/3 complex, which nucleates actin polymerization. The Arp2/3 complex is essential in initiation of actin assembly and Shigella movement, as previously observed for Listeria monocytogenes. Activation of N-WASP by IcsA unmasks two domains acting together in insertional actin polymerization. The isolated COOH-terminal domain of N-WASP containing a verprolin-homology region, a cofilin-homology sequence, and an acidic terminal segment (VCA) interacts with G-actin in a unique profilin-like functional fashion. Hence, when N-WASP is activated, its COOH-terminal domain feeds barbed end growth of filaments and lowers the critical concentration at the bacterial surface. On the other hand, the NH(2)-terminal domain of N-WASP interacts with F-actin, mediating the attachment of the actin tail to the bacterium surface. VASP is not involved in Shigella movement, and the function of profilin does not require its binding to proline-rich regions.
7577941	Comparison of lethal and nonlethal transthyretin variants and their relationship to amyloid disease.	The role that transthyretin (TTR) mutations play in the amyloid disease familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) has been probed by comparing the biophysical properties of several TTR variants as a function of pH. We have previously demonstrated that the partial acid denaturation of TTR is sufficient to effect amyloid fibril formation by self-assembly of a denaturation intermediate which appears to be monomeric. Earlier studies on the most pathogenic FAP variant known, Leu-55-Pro, revealed that this variant is much less stable toward acid denaturation than wild-type TTR, apparently explaining why this variant can form amyloid fibrils under mildly acidic conditions where wild-type TTR remains nonamyloidogenic. The hypothesis that FAP mutations destabilize the TTR tetramer in favor of a monomeric amyloidogenic intermediate under lysosomal (acidic) conditions is further supported by the data described here. We compare the acid stability and amyloidogenicity of the most prevalent FAP variant, Val-30-Met, along with the double mutant, Val-30-Met/Thr-119-Met, which serves to model the effects of these mutations in heterozygous patients where the mutations are in different subunits. In addition, we have characterized the Thr-119-Met TTR variant, which is a common nonpathogenic variant in the Portuguese population, to further investigate the role that this mutation plays in protecting individuals who also carry the Val-30-Met mutation against the classically severe FAP pathology. This biophysical study demonstrates that Val-30-Met TTR is significantly less stable toward acid denaturation and more amyloidogenic than wild-type TTR, which in turn is less stable and more amyloidogenic than Thr-119-Met TTR. Interestingly, the double mutant Val-30-Met/Thr-119-Met is very similar to wild-type TTR in terms of its stability toward acid denaturation and its amyloidogenicity. The data suggest that the Thr-119-Met mutation confers decreased amyloidogenicity by stabilizing tetrameric TTR toward acid denaturation. In addition, fluorescence studies monitoring the acid-mediated denaturation pathways of several TTR variants reveal that the majority exhibit a plateau in the relative fluorescence intensity over the amyloid-forming pH range, i.e., ca. pH 4.3-3.3. This intensity plateau suggests that the amyloidogenic intermediate(s) is (are) being observed over this pH range. The Thr-119-Met variant does not exhibit this plateau presumably because the amyloidogenic intermediate(s) do(es) not build up in concentration in this variant. The intermediate is undoubtedly forming in the Thr-119-Met variant, as it will form amyloid fibrils at high concentrations; however, the intermediate is only present at a low steady-state concentration which makes it difficult to detect.
10051640	Analysis of masked mutations in familial adenomatous polyposis.	Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal-dominant disease characterized by the development of hundreds of adenomatous polyps of the colorectum. Approximately 80% of FAP patients can be shown to have truncating mutations of the APC gene. To determine the cause of FAP in the other 20% of patients, MAMA (monoallelic mutation analysis) was used to independently examine the status of each of the two APC alleles. Seven of nine patients analyzed were found to have significantly reduced expression from one of their two alleles whereas two patients were found to have full-length expression from both alleles. We conclude that more than 95% of patients with FAP have inactivating mutations in APC and that a combination of MAMA and standard genetic tests will identify APC abnormalities in the vast majority of such patients. That no APC expression from the mutant allele is found in some FAP patients argues strongly against the requirement for dominant negative effects of APC mutations. The results also suggest that there may be at least one additional gene, besides APC, that can give rise to FAP.
10665844	Characterization of APC exon 15 germ-line mutation in FAP family with severe phenotype showing extracolonic symptoms.	The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene plays a crucial role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Germ-line mutations of APC gene give rise to familial adenomatous polyposis coli (FAP) - autosomal dominant syndrome manifesting hundreds to thousands of colorectal polyps, if untreated with malignant progression. We have used the techniques of heteroduplex analysis (HDA), protein truncation test (PTT), single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing for the identification and detailed positional analysis of mutations in IFAP family with the expressive phenotype characterized by polyposis and extracolonic lesions. Detailed analysis revealed a 5bp deletion in a mutation cluster region (MCR) in exon 15 of APC gene in codon 1308. Two screened members of the FAP family exhibited this novel mutation.
10674823	Loss of heterozygosity of adenomatous polyposis coli gene in cutaneous tumors as determined by using polymerase chain reaction and paraffin section preparations.	It has been suggested that an alteration in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, which is a tumor suppressor gene, is one of the earlier events in carcinogenesis of some adenocarcinomas. We undertook this study to determine the prevalence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the APC gene in several kinds of cutaneous tumors. Fifty-seven unrelated Japanese patients were examined for analysis of the APC gene. The 57 cases consisted of extramammary Paget's disease, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), eccrine poroma and porocarcinoma, metastatic tumor of rectal adenocarcinoma and malignant melanoma. DNA was extracted from the tumor and normal portions dissected from the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedding sections and amplified with the use of the PCR. The amplified DNA was examined for LOH in the APC gene. Seven samples of 32 heterozygous persons of APC gene (three out of seven eccrine poromas, two eccrine porocarcinomas and two metastatic tumors of rectal adenocarcinoma) showed for LOH in the APC gene. None of the heterozygous samples from the extramammary Paget's disease (11), SCC (five) and melanoma (five) showed LOH. These results suggest that tumor or tumor suppressor genes, other than the APC gene, may be responsible for extramammary Paget's disease and SCC and that LOH involving APC may have some relevance to the formation and progression of eccrine tumors as in rectal tumors.
10722668	Down-regulation of beta-catenin by the colorectal tumor suppressor APC requires association with Axin and beta-catenin.	The tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is mutated in familial adenomatous polyposis and in sporadic colorectal tumors. APC forms a complex with beta-catenin, Axin, and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta and induces the degradation of beta-catenin. In the present study, we examined whether APC association with Axin is required for degradation of beta-catenin. We found that a fragment of APC that induces beta-catenin degradation was rendered inactive by disruption of its Axin-binding sites. Also, overexpression of an Axin fragment spanning the regulator of the G-protein signaling domain inhibited APC-mediated beta-catenin degradation. An APC fragment with mutated beta-catenin-binding sites but intact Axin-binding sites also failed to induce degradation of beta-catenin. These results suggest that APC requires interaction with Axin and beta-catenin to down-regulate beta-catenin.
11808944	Genetic predisposition to clinical manifestations in familial adenomatous polyposis with special reference to duodenal lesions.	OBJECTIVES: In familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), genetic predisposition for duodenal adenomatosis has not been investigated precisely. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutation and duodenal adenomatosis in FAP. METHODS: APC gene mutation was determined by means of a protein truncation test in 34 patients from 25 families with FAP. The prevalence and grade of duodenal adenomatosis were compared among the proximal mutation group (exons 1-9), the distal mutation group (exons 10-15), and the undetermined groups. The correlation between the course of duodenal adenomatosis and APC gene mutation was retrospectively investigated in 19 patients. RESULTS: The prevalence of duodenal adenomatosis was lower in the proximal mutation group (44%) than in the distal mutation (100%) and undetermined (83%) groups. In patients with positive duodenal adenomatosis, the endoscopic grade did not differ among the groups. The endoscopic grade increased in two of the four patients with the proximal mutation group (50%), in three of 10 patients with the distal mutation group (30%), and in two of five patients (40%) with the undetermined group. CONCLUSIONS: Truncating APC gene mutation proximal to exon 9 may contribute to the less frequent development of duodenal adenomatosis in FAP, but severity and progression of duodenal adenomatosis do not seem to be determined by APC gene mutation alone.
12045208	The 'just-right' signaling model: APC somatic mutations are selected based on a specific level of activation of the beta-catenin signaling cascade.	According to the classical interpretation of Knudson's 'two-hit' hypothesis for tumorigenesis, the two 'hits' are independent mutation events, the end result of which is loss of a tumor suppressing function. Recently, it has been shown that the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) gene does not entirely follow this model. Both the position and type of the second hit in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) polyps depend on the localization of the germline mutation. This non-random distribution of somatic hits has been interpreted as the result of selection for more advantageous mutations during tumor formation. However, the APC gene encodes for a multifunctional protein, and the exact cellular function upon which this selection is based is yet unknown. In this study, we have analyzed somatic APC point mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 133 colorectal adenomas from six FAP patients. We observed that when germline mutations result in truncated proteins without any of the seven beta-catenin downregulating 20-amino-acid repeats distributed in the central domain of APC, the majority of the corresponding somatic point mutations retain one or, less frequently, two of the same 20-amino-acid repeats. Conversely, when the germline mutation results in a truncated protein retaining one 20-amino-acid repeat, most second hits remove all 20-amino-acid repeats. The latter is frequently accomplished by allelic loss. Notably, and in contrast to previous observations, in a patient where the germline APC mutation retains two such repeats, the majority of the somatic hits are point mutations (and not LOH) located upstream and removing all of the 20-amino-acid repeats. These results indicate selection for APC genotypes that are likely to retain some activity in downregulating beta-catenin signaling. We propose that this selection process is aimed at a specific degree of beta-catenin signaling optimal for tumor formation, rather than at its constitutive activation by deletion of all of the beta-catenin downregulating motifs in APC.
12907606	Regulation of caspase expression and apoptosis by adenomatous polyposis coli.	The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, a member of the WNT pathway, has been shown to assign intestinal epithelial cells to a program of proliferation or differentiation through regulation of the beta-catenin/TCF-4 complex. Wild-type APC, in certain cellular contexts, appears to induce differentiation and apoptosis, although mutant forms of APC, known to produce polyps and ultimately cancers, may suppress these events. Here, we show that mutant forms of APC can induce repression of select terminal caspases as a potential means of attenuating responses to apoptotic stimuli. Using gene expression profiling to interrogate the intact intestines of Apc(+/min) mice harboring numerous polyps, we identified a reduction in the mRNA expression of both caspases 3 and 7. We additionally identified a reduction in protein levels of caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9 in human colon cancer specimens known to harbor APC mutations. A reduction in caspase protein levels resulted in resistance to apoptotic-inducing agents and restoration of caspase levels reinstated apoptotic capacities. Consistent with Wnt pathway involvement, dominant negative TCF/LEF induced caspase protein expression. These data provide support for the hypothesis that one of the functions of APC is the regulation of caspase activity and other apoptotic proteins by controlling their expression levels in the cell.
7962323	Mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene in sporadic thyroid neoplasms.	Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between familial adenomatous polyposis coli (FAP) and thyroid neoplasms. Predisposition to FAP is conferred by mutations in the APC gene, located on chromosome 5q21. Somatic mutations of APC are also observed in about 60% of sporadic colorectal adenomas and carcinomas, suggesting that disruption of this putative tumor suppressor gene may play a role in both familial as well as acquired colorectal tumorigenesis. The APC gene is expressed in normal human thyroid, thyroid adenomas, and differentiated carcinoma tissues as well as in four clonal human thyroid carcinoma cell lines, as demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of a 388-base APC messenger ribonucleic acid fragment spanning exons 14 and 15, followed by hybridization to an exon 15-specific complementary DNA probe. Eighty human thyroid neoplasms were examined for loss of heterozygosity of the APC locus, using primers flanking a hypervariable dinucleotide (CA) repeat (CB26) immediately adjacent to the APC gene. Of 71% informative samples, 2 showed allelic loss: a follicular adenoma (FA) and a nodule from a multinodular goiter (MNG). The DNA of 83 benign and malignant thyroid neoplasms and 4 thyroid carcinoma cell lines was examined for mutations within a 1200-basepair stretch of exon 15 by single strand conformation polymorphism. Five sets of overlapping primers were used for PCR. The anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell line (ARO) had 1 APC allele with an adenine insertion at codon 1556 (ACTA to AACTA), leading to a premature stop codon at 1558. An anaplastic carcinoma had a mutation of codon 1346 (TCA-CCA; Ser to Pro). In summary, the APC gene is expressed in normal and neoplastic human thyroid tissue and is a target for inactivating mutations in some thyroid tumors.
8248216	Dimer formation by an N-terminal coiled coil in the APC protein.	Mutations in the human APC gene are associated with an inherited predisposition to colon cancer. APC codes for polypeptides of approximately 2800 amino acids, with sequence homologies to coiled-coil proteins in the first 900 residues. To determine the oligomerization properties of the APC protein, we used genetic and biochemical approaches to examine the ability of APC fragments to self-associate. A subdomain comprising the first 55 amino acids of APC was found to form a stable, parallel, helical dimer, as expected for a coiled coil. The location of a key dimerization element at the N terminus of the protein supports models in which mutations in APC exert effects through dimerization of the mutant gene products.
9404855	Glomangiosarcoma of the lower limb: a case report with a literature review.	Glomangiosarcoma (GS) is a very unusual but morphologically distinctive tumor of soft tissue. We report a case of GS which occurred in the subcutaneous tissue of a 56-year-old man. Microscopically, a typical glomus tumor surrounded a central area of sarcoma. Immunohistochemical stains were performed, and there was a strong positive reaction for vimentin, muscle-specific actin and smooth muscle actin. We also review the clinicopathologic findings of the 9 GS that have previously been reported.
11166179	Binding of the adenomatous polyposis coli protein to microtubules increases microtubule stability and is regulated by GSK3 beta phosphorylation.	Truncation mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli protein (APC) are responsible for familial polyposis, a form of inherited colon cancer. In addition to its role in mediating beta-catenin degradation in the Wnt signaling pathway, APC plays a role in regulating microtubules. This was suggested by its localization to the end of dynamic microtubules in actively migrating areas of cells and by the apparent correlation between the dissociation of APC from polymerizing microtubules and their subsequent depolymerization [1, 2]. The microtubule binding domain is deleted in the transforming mutations of APC [3, 4]; however, the direct effect of APC protein on microtubules has never been examined. Here we show that binding of APC to microtubules increases microtubule stability in vivo and in vitro. Deleting the previously identified microtubule binding site from the C-terminal domain of APC does not eliminate its binding to microtubules but decreases the ability of APC to stabilize them significantly. The interaction of APC with microtubules is decreased by phosphorylation of APC by GSK3 beta. These data confirm the hypothesis that APC is involved in stabilizing microtubule ends. They also suggest that binding of APC to microtubules is mediated by at least two distinct sites and is regulated by phosphorylation.
12058346	Evidence that Griscelli syndrome with neurological involvement is caused by mutations in RAB27A, not MYO5A.	Griscelli syndrome (GS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder, is characterized by partial albinism, along with immunologic abnormalities or severe neurological impairment or both. Mutations in one of two different genes on chromosome 15q can cause the different subtypes of GS. Most patients with GS display the hemophagocytic syndrome and have mutations in RAB27A, which codes for a small GTPase. Two patients with neurological involvement have mutations in MYO5A, which codes for an actin-based molecular motor. The RAB27A and MYO5A gene products interact with each other and function in vesicle trafficking. We report the molecular basis of GS in a Muslim Arab kindred whose members have extremely variable neurological involvement, along with the hemophagocytic syndrome and immunologic abnormalities. The patients have normal MYO5A genes but exhibit a homozygous 67.5-kb deletion that eliminates RAB27A mRNA and immunocytofluorescence-detectable protein. We also describe the molecular organization of RAB27A and a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay for the founder deletion in this kindred. Finally, we propose that all patients with GS have RAB27A mutations and immunologic abnormalities that sometimes result in secondary neurological involvement. The two patients described elsewhere who have MYO5A mutations and neurological complications but no immunologic defects may not have GS but instead may have Elejalde syndrome, a condition characterized by mild hypopigmentation and severe, primary neurological abnormalities.
9311916	Rapid colorectal adenoma formation initiated by conditional targeting of the Apc gene.	Familial adenomatous polyposis coli (FAP) is a disease characterized by the development of multiple colorectal adenomas, and affected individuals carry germline mutations in the APC gene. With the use of a conditional gene targeting system, a mouse model of FAP was created that circumvents the embryonic lethality of Apc deficiency and directs Apc inactivation specifically to the colorectal epithelium. loxP sites were inserted into the introns around Apc exon 14, and the resultant mutant allele (Apc580S) was introduced into the mouse germline. Mice homozygous for Apc580S were normal; however, upon infection of the colorectal region with an adenovirus encoding the Cre recombinase, the mice developed adenomas within 4 weeks. The adenomas showed deletion of Apc exon 14, indicating that the loss of Apc function was caused by Cre-loxP-mediated recombination.
9717251	Interaction of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli with host epithelial cells.	Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) causes severe diarrhea in young children. Upon infection, EPEC induces the assembly of highly organized pedestal-like actin structures in host epithelial cells. All the EPEC genes that are involved in inducing formation of actin pedestals are located in a unique 35 kbp chromosomal pathogenicity island, termed LEE. These genes include the sep genes that encode components of type III protein secretion system, and genes that encode proteins secreted by this system, the esp genes. This protein secretion system is activated upon contact with the host cell, resulting in increased secretion of Esp proteins. Some of these Esp proteins from the translocation apparatus while others are translocated into the cytoplasm of the host cell. Concerted activity of the LEE genes including the eae, esp and the sep genes is needed to trigger signal transduction in the host cell which results in formation of an actin pedestal.
9724749	The adenomatous polyposis coli-binding protein EB1 is associated with cytoplasmic and spindle microtubules.	The evolutionarily conserved protein EB1 originally was identified by its physical association with the carboxyl-terminal portion of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor protein, an APC domain commonly mutated in familial and sporadic forms of colorectal neoplasia. The subcellular localization of EB1 in epithelial cells was studied by using immunofluorescence and biochemical techniques. EB1 colocalized both to cytoplasmic microtubules in interphase cells and to spindle microtubules during mitosis, with pronounced centrosome staining. The cytoskeletal array detected by anti-EB1 antibody was abolished by incubation of the cells with nocodazole, an agent that disrupts microtubules; upon drug removal, EB1 localized to the microtubule-organizing center. Immunofluorescence analysis of SW480, a colon cancer cell line that expresses only carboxyl-terminal-deleted APC unable to interact with EB1, demonstrated that EB1 remained localized to the microtubule cytoskeleton, suggesting that this pattern of subcellular distribution is not mediated by its interaction with APC. In vitro cosedimentation with taxol-stabilized microtubules demonstrated that a significant fraction of EB1 associated with microtubules. Recent studies of the yeast EB1 homologues Mal3 and Bim1p have demonstrated that both proteins localize to microtubules and are important in vivo for microtubule function. Our results demonstrate that EB1 is a novel component of the microtubule cytoskeleton in mammalian cells. Associating with the mitotic apparatus, EB1 may play a physiologic role connecting APC to cellular division, coordinating the control of normal growth and differentiation processes in the colonic epithelium.
10414869	Effects of interferons on proliferation and collagen synthesis of rat palatal wound fibroblasts.	The purpose was to select drugs that specifically reduce collagen synthesis by palatal granulation fibroblasts without affecting their proliferation. Granulation fibroblasts were obtained from 8-day-old palatal mucoperiosteal wounds and normal fibroblasts from palatal tissue of unwounded rats. Cultured cells were treated with interferon-alpha2b, interferon-beta and interferon-gamma (0, 100, 1000, and 10000 U/ml). Cell proliferation was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Collagen synthesis and non-collagenous protein synthesis were determined from the incorporation of [3H]proline. None of the interferons significantly inhibited the proliferation of either type of fibroblasts. Interferon-alpha2b had no effect on the variables studied at the dosages used. Interferon-beta reduced collagen synthesis of granulation fibroblasts without affecting their non-collagenous protein synthesis or protein synthesis by normal fibroblasts. Interferon-gamma reduced collagen synthesis of both types of fibroblast and the non-collagenous protein synthesis of granulation fibroblasts. These data show that interferon-beta specifically reduces collagen synthesis by oral granulation fibroblasts without affecting normal palatal fibroblasts.
10524632	Reconstitution of actin-based motility of Listeria and Shigella using pure proteins.	Actin polymerization is essential for cell locomotion and is thought to generate the force responsible for cellular protrusions. The Arp2/3 complex is required to stimulate actin assembly at the leading edge in response to signalling. The bacteria Listeria and Shigella bypass the signalling pathway and harness the Arp2/3 complex to induce actin assembly and to propel themselves in living cells. However, the Arp2/3 complex alone is insufficient to promote movement. Here we have used pure components of the actin cytoskeleton to reconstitute sustained movement in Listeria and Shigella in vitro. Actin-based propulsion is driven by the free energy released by ATP hydrolysis linked to actin polymerization, and does not require myosin. In addition to actin and activated Arp2/3 complex, actin depolymerizing factor (ADF, or cofilin) and capping protein are also required for motility as they maintain a high steady-state level of G-actin, which controls the rate of unidirectional growth of actin filaments at the surface of the bacterium. The movement is more effective when profilin, alpha-actinin and VASP (for Listeria) are also included. These results have implications for our understanding of the mechanism of actin-based motility in cells.
10963677	The vav exchange factor is an essential regulator in actin-dependent receptor translocation to the lymphocyte-antigen-presenting cell interface.	During the interaction of a T cell with an antigen-presenting cell (APC), several receptor ligand pairs, including the T cell receptor (TCR)/major histocompatibility complex (MHC), accumulate at the T cell/APC interface in defined geometrical patterns. This accumulation depends on a movement of the T cell cortical actin cytoskeleton toward the interface. Here we study the involvement of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor vav in this process. We crossed 129 vav(-/-) mice with B10/BR 5C.C7 TCR transgenic mice and used peptide-loaded APCs to stimulate T cells from the offspring. We found that the accumulation of TCR/MHC at the T cell/APC interface and the T cell actin cytoskeleton rearrangement were clearly defective in these vav(+/-) mice. A comparable defect in superantigen-mediated T cell activation of T cells from non-TCR transgenic 129 mice was also observed, although in this case it was more apparent in vav(-/-) mice. These data indicate that vav is an essential regulator of cytoskeletal rearrangements during T cell activation.
12120230	Update of familial pancreatic cancer in Germany.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The prevalence of familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) and the characteristics of FPC have not yet been well investigated in the German population. Therefore, a German case collection for FPC was established in July 1999 to collect and evaluate data on FPC families. METHODS: The prevalence of pancreatic cancer (PC) as well as other tumours and diseases was studied in families with at least 2 first-degree relatives with histologically confirmed PC, and in families of patients with PC and a first-degree relative with malignant melanoma. All participating family members were genetically counselled and evaluated by a standardised questionnaire. RESULTS: In an 18-month period, 73 independent kindreds with potential FPC contacted the national case collection. So far, 20 kindreds have fulfilled the criteria for FPC and have undergone complete workups. Most families revealed an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Twelve families revealed an isolated accumulation of PC. Importantly, in 8 of 20 (35%) families, additional tumour types such as melanoma, breast and prostate cancer occurred. CONCLUSION: The observed phenotypic heterogeneity indicates an association with predisposing tumour suppressor genes p16 and BRCA2 in up to 30% of FPC families. Mutation analysis of these candidate genes might lead to the identification of the predisposing gene defect in a proportion of FPC families.
9951419	[The role of APC in colonic cancerogenesis: zeroing in on Myc].	The APC gene is mutated both in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and sporadic colorectal cancers. It had been previously shown that the APC gene product interacts with beta-catenin, a key element in the Wnt-1 signaling pathway. This pathway is initiated by the growth factor Wnt-1 and ends up in the nucleus where it activates transcription factors of the Lef/Tcf family although the targets of the latter were still unknown. This has just been accomplished by the identification of the c-MYC oncogene as the relevant target of the Wnt-1/APC pathway in the development of human colorectal cancers. Indeed, under appropriate conditions (presence of growth factors, for example), c-MYC is an essential determinant of cell proliferation.
10899006	The dynamic behavior of the APC-binding protein EB1 on the distal ends of microtubules.	Adenomatous polyposis coli protein (APC) is a well-characterized tumor suppressor protein [1] [2] [3]. We previously showed that APC tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in Xenopus A6 epithelial cells moves along a subset of microtubules and accumulates at their growing plus ends in cell extensions [4]. EB1, which was identified as an APC-binding protein by yeast two-hybrid analysis [5], was also reported to be associated with microtubules [6] [7] [8]. To examine the interaction between APC and EB1 within cells, we compared the dynamic behavior of EB1-GFP with that of APC-GFP in A6 transfectants. Time-lapse microscopy of live cells at interphase revealed that EB1-GFP was concentrated at all of the growing microtubule ends throughout the cytoplasm and abruptly disappeared from the ends when microtubules began to shorten. Therefore, EB1 appeared to be co-localized and interact with APC on the growing ends of a subset of microtubules. When APC-GFP was overexpressed, endogenous EB1 was recruited to APC-GFP, which accumulated in large amounts on microtubules. On the other hand, when microtubules were disassembled by nocodazole, EB1 was not co-localized with APC-GFP, which was concentrated along the basal plasma membrane. During mitosis, APC appeared to be dissociated from microtubules, whereas EB1-GFP continued to concentrate at microtubule growing ends. These findings showed that the APC-EB1 interaction is regulated within cells and is allowed near the ends of microtubules only under restricted conditions.
7987441	[Contribution of genetic typing for the diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis in pediatrics].	BACKGROUND: The gene responsible for familial adenomatous polyposis, (APC), has been recently cloned and genetic map with several polymorphic markers has been established. POPULATION AND METHODS: Blood samples (20 ml) were taken from 34 subjects belonging to four families at risk for familial adenomatous polyposis. Nineteen of these 34, less than 20 years old, had one parent having polyposis or dead because of it. Polyposis was diagnosed, in ten of these 19 by endoscopy. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes and Southern blot analyses were performed in each family, using RFLPs on both sides of the APC locus. RESULTS: DNA analysis identified normal and mutant haplotypes at the APC locus in each family. It was thus possible to follow the segregation of mutant alleles. These results were compared with the anamnestic and endoscopic data. Bearing in mind the risk of recombination when using extragenic markers, RFLPs allowed early diagnosis of APC in pre and/or asymptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic analysis can be used to diagnose APC in affected families, provided the risk of recombination is taken into account. Intragenic microsatellites markers will soon be available. These will provide more information on the APC gene, and hence direct molecular diagnosis of APC.
8012355	Loss of heterozygosity of MCC is not associated with mutation of the retained allele in sporadic colorectal cancer.	The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, which transmits familial adenomatous polyposis, is frequently mutated in sporadic colorectal tumours. Acquired somatic mutations have also been reported in a second gene, mutated in colorectal cancer (MCC), which lies within 500 kb of APC on chromosome 5q21 and has thus been implicated in tumour development. Further evidence for an oncosuppressor gene other than APC on chromosome 5q comes from recent studies of lung, renal and hepatic cancers in which there is loss of heterozygosity of 5q21 but no somatic APC mutations. To investigate the relative importance of APC and MCC in sporadic colorectal cancer, we have assessed the extent of 5q21 allelic loss in 80 carcinomas. All informative tumours exhibiting allelic loss had deletions which included both APC and MCC. In 21 tumours with loss of heterozygosity in MCC we have screened the entire coding region of the gene for mutation of the retained allele and found no evidence for mutation. The data indicate that independent loss of MCC is a rare event, and that in cases where allele loss occurs mutation of the retained allele is uncommon. This suggests that MCC does not function as an independent tumour suppressor in the majority of colorectal cancers.
8020934	Rapid detection of translation-terminating mutations at the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene by direct protein truncation test.	Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is usually associated with protein truncating mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. The APC mutations are known to play a major role in colorectal carcinogenesis. For the identification of protein truncating mutations of the APC gene, we developed a rapid, sensitive, and direct screening procedure. The technique is based on the in vitro transcription and translation of the genomic PCR products and is called the protein truncation test. Samples of DNA from individual FAP patients, members of a FAP family, colorectal tumors, and colorectal tumor-derived cell lines were used to show the effectiveness of this method.
8194700	Phenotypic variability of familial adenomatous polyposis in 11 unrelated families with identical APC gene mutation.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Familial adenomatous polyposis is caused by germline mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Affected individuals develop hundreds of colorectal adenomas at young age and can have extracolonic lesions. METHODS: This study evaluated the phenotype of 74 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis from 11 unrelated families with an identical 5-base pair deletion at codon 1309 of the APC gene. RESULTS: Polyp density in the sigmoid colon of 16 patients from 9 families varied from 3.8 to 13.1/cm2, and mean polyp diameter ranged from 1.4 +/- 0.1 to 2.7 +/- 0.1 mm. The distribution of colonic adenomas also varied, with diffuse polyposis in 6 patients but relative polyp sparing in the more proximal colon in 6 others. Age at diagnosis of colorectal cancer ranged from 19 to 62 years, but the mean age did not differ among the 4 families with multiple cases. Colorectal cancers occurred predominantly in the rectosigmoid (80%) but also in the more proximal colon. The percentage of patients affected by various extracolonic lesions differed widely among and within the 11 families (range, 0%-100%). CONCLUSIONS: APC gene mutation at codon 1309 results in intrafamily and interfamily phenotypic variation in familial adenomatous polyposis. Environmental and/or other genetic factors must play roles in the expression of germline APC gene mutations.
9092316	Phenotypic expression of disease in families that have mutations in the 5' region of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene.	BACKGROUND: Germline mutation in a gene on chromosome 5 (the adenomatous polyposis coli gene) causes familial adenomatous polyposis of the colorectum. Phenotypic manifestations of this condition vary, but the exact relation of the phenotype to the mutation site along the gene has not been fully described. OBJECTIVE: To determine how the location of mutations along a gene that is associated with multiple colorectal polyps (the adenomatous polyposis coli gene) is related to the phenotypic expression of the syndrome in families. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Polyposis registry. PATIENTS: 20 patients from 7 families that had mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene that were located toward the 5' end of codon 158 (proximal 5' families), were compared with 52 patients from 7 families that had mutations downstream from codon 158, in codons 179 to 625 (distal 5' families). MEASUREMENTS: Sex, age at diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis, number of polyps at first examination of the colon, distribution of polyps, age at diagnosis of colorectal cancer, and location of colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Mutations that were proximal to codon 158 were found in 7 of 112 families (6%). At the first examination of the colon, 8 of 17 (47%) patients in proximal 5' families and 9 of 48 (19%) patients of similar ages in distal 5' families were found to have fewer than 100 adenomas (P = 0.029). The distribution of polyps was frequently right-sided in patients in proximal 5' families (P = 0.001). The cumulative probability of survival without colorectal cancer was greater for patients in proximal 5' families (P = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: Families with adenomatous polyposis that have proximal 5' mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene are more likely to have a heterogeneous phenotype with delayed development of colonic polyposis and colorectal cancer than are families with distal 5' mutations of the gene. Management should include genotyping of patients who are at risk, colonoscopic surveillance of genotypically positive persons, and prophylactic colectomy if several adenomas are found.
9430714	The role of actin-binding protein 280 in integrin-dependent mechanoprotection.	To survive in a mechanically active environment, cells must adapt to variations of applied membrane tension. A collagen-coated magnetic bead model was used to apply forces directly to the actin cytoskeleton through integrin receptors. We demonstrate here that by a calcium-dependent mechanism, human fibroblasts reinforce locally their connection with extracellular adhesion sites by inducing actin assembly and by recruiting actin-binding protein 280 (ABP-280) into cortical adhesion complexes. ABP-280 was phosphorylated on serine residues as a result of force application. This phosphorylation and the force-induced actin reorganization were largely abrogated by inhibitors of protein kinase C. In a human melanoma cell line that does not express ABP-280, actin accumulation could not be induced by force, whereas in stable transfectants expressing ABP-280, force-induced actin accumulation was similar to human fibroblasts. Cortical actin assembly played a role in regulating the activity of stretch-activated, calcium-permeable channels (SAC) since sustained force application desensitized SAC to subsequent force applications, and the decrease in stretch sensitivity was reversed after treatment with cytochalasin D. ABP-280-deficient cells showed a > 90% increase in cell death compared with ABP-280 +ve cells after force application. We conclude that ABP-280 plays an important role in mechanoprotection by reinforcing the membrane cortex and desensitizing SACs.
7796392	Evidence against dominant negative mechanisms of intestinal polyp formation by Apc gene mutations.	Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are responsible for not only familial adenomatous polyposis but also many sporadic cancers of the digestive tract. Most mutations found in familial adenomatous polyposis patients are of the truncation type, and the phenotype is affected by the mutation sites in the gene. Truncated APC proteins can associate with the wild-type protein. Accordingly, it has been proposed that the polyposis is caused by a dominant negative mechanism. To test this possibility, we constructed transgenic mice that contained mutant minigenes. They expressed the APC protein truncated either at codon 716 (Apc delta 716) or 1287 (Apc delta 1287) at high levels in the intestinal epithelium. Contrary to our expectation, no intestinal polyps or tumors were found in any of such mice, even after 7 months. These results rule out any dominant negative mechanisms in which the truncated APC protein is directly involved in the formation of intestinal polyps in the mouse.
9731892	Infrequent somatic mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene in aberrant crypt foci of human colon tissue.	BACKGROUND: The authors examined somatic mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene in 84 human aberrant crypt foci (ACF) to determine whether APC gene mutations were involved in the histologic progression of ACF. METHODS: Mutation cluster regions of the APC gene were subjected to polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. RESULTS: Four kinds of deletion were detected in the mutation cluster regions of APC gene in five ACF. APC mutation was detected in 1 of 18 ACF with Stage I abnormalities (6%). Four of 10 adenomatous ACF (40%) harbored the mutation. There were no mutations in 56 hyperplastic ACF. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that APC mutations may be involved initially in only a limited number of adenomas in ACF.
10480945	Inhibition of fibronectin matrix assembly by the heparin-binding domain of vitronectin.	The deposition of fibronectin into the extracellular matrix is an integrin-dependent, multistep process that is tightly regulated in order to ensure controlled matrix deposition. Reduced fibronectin deposition has been associated with altered embryonic development, tumor cell invasion, and abnormal wound repair. In one of the initial steps of fibronectin matrix assembly, the amino-terminal region of fibronectin binds to cell surface receptors, termed matrix assembly sites. The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of extracellular signals in the regulation of fibronectin deposition. Our data indicate that the interaction of cells with the extracellular glycoprotein, vitronectin, specifically inhibits matrix assembly site expression and fibronectin deposition. The region of vitronectin responsible for the inhibition of fibronectin deposition was localized to the heparin-binding domain. Vitronectin's heparin-binding domain inhibited both beta(1) and non-beta(1) integrin-dependent matrix assembly site expression and could be overcome by treatment of cells with lysophosphatidic acid, an agent that promotes actin polymerization. The interaction of cells with the heparin-binding domain of vitronectin resulted in changes in actin microfilament organization and the subcellular distribution of the actin-associated proteins alpha-actinin and talin. These data suggest a mechanism whereby the heparin-binding domain of vitronectin regulates the deposition of fibronectin into the extracellular matrix through alterations in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton.
12942085	Selected lipids activate phagosome actin assembly and maturation resulting in killing of pathogenic mycobacteria.	Pathogenic mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium facilitate disease by surviving intracellularly within a potentially hostile environment: the macrophage phagosome. They inhibit phagosome maturation processes, including fusion with lysosomes, acidification and, as shown here, membrane actin assembly. An in vitro assay developed for latex bead phagosomes (LBPs) provided insights into membrane signalling events that regulate phagosome actin assembly, a process linked to membrane fusion. Different lipids were found to stimulate or inhibit actin assembly by LBPs and mycobacterial phagosomes in vitro. In addition, selected lipids activated actin assembly and phagosome maturation in infected macrophages, resulting in a significant killing of M. tuberculosis and M. avium. In contrast, the polyunsaturated sigma-3 lipids behaved differently and stimulated pathogen growth. Thus, lipids can be involved in both stimulatory and inhibitory signalling networks in the phagosomal membrane.
8182459	High levels of expression of the tumor suppressor gene APC during development of the rat central nervous system.	The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in human familial adenomatous polyposis, an autosomal dominant condition with predisposition to colorectal carcinoma and brain tumors. Although tumor suppressor genes appear to play a general role in regulating cellular proliferation, the normal biological function of the APC gene product is unknown. In the present study, we cloned fragments of the rat homolog of the APC gene and examined its tissue distribution by Northern blot analysis. These studies demonstrated particularly high levels of APC mRNA in brain. To gain clues to the role of the APC gene in brain function, we examined the neuroanatomical distribution of APC mRNA using in situ hybridization. In the adult, prominent expression of APC mRNA was observed in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and cerebellum, with low levels of hybridization in other regions of adult rat brain. In contrast, during embryonic and early postnatal development (1-2 weeks), high levels of APC expression were found throughout the brain and then decreased to adult levels by 6 weeks after birth, except in the olfactory bulb where the high levels of APC mRNA found in development persist in the adult. During development of cortex, cerebellum, and retina, APC mRNA expression was particularly prominent in layers containing newly formed postmitotic neurons, with lower levels observed in the proliferative zones where neurogenesis occurs. The high levels of APC expression from early neurogenesis until late stages of neuronal maturation suggest that APC may contribute to suppressing neuronal proliferation during this period of intense growth.
9732165	Application of argon plasma coagulation in skin surgery.	BACKGROUND: Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is a noncontact electrosurgical technique which has been used in open surgery for about 20 years and in endoscopy for about 5 years. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to provide preliminary results on the effect of this method in skin surgery. METHODS: The effects of variations in gas flow, output power and coagulation times on the extent of the resulting skin coagulation zone were tested in a pig skin model. Furthermore, preliminary results were obtained from 48 patients. RESULTS: The depth of the coagulation zone, which depends on the output power of the high-frequency (HF) generator and the application time, was examined clinically and histologically in 150 different pig skin coagulations. The maximum depth of the coagulation zone was 4 mm. Coagulation zones below 4 mm can be maintained by controlling the output power of the HF generator and/or the duration of application. Variations of argon flow did not influence the depth of the coagulation zone significantly. In preliminary clinical tests, 48 patients with common warts, senile hemangiomas and actinic keratoses were treated with APC. In all cases, APC was highly effective and easy to perform. No severe problems or complications were observed. The skin lesions were destroyed with minimal or no scarring and without damaging the surrounding tissue. CONCLUSION: In the present preliminary study, APC proved to be an effective treatment with well-controlled tissue destruction. Further clinical studies are required to evaluate the suitability and the indications of this method in the treatment of cutaneous lesions.
11698443	Superantigen-induced T cell:B cell conjugation is mediated by LFA-1 and requires signaling through Lck, but not ZAP-70.	The formation of a conjugate between a T cell and an APC requires the activation of integrins on the T cell surface and remodeling of cytoskeletal elements at the cell-cell contact site via inside-out signaling. The early events in this signaling pathway are not well understood, and may differ from the events involved in adhesion to immobilized ligands. We find that conjugate formation between Jurkat T cells and EBV-B cells presenting superantigen is mediated by LFA-1 and absolutely requires Lck. Mutations in the Lck kinase, Src homology 2 or 3 domains, or the myristoylation site all inhibit conjugation to background levels, and adhesion cannot be restored by the expression of Fyn. However, ZAP-70-deficient cells conjugate normally, indicating that Lck is required for LFA-1-dependent adhesion via other downstream pathways. Several drugs that inhibit T cell adhesion to ICAM-1 immobilized on plastic, including inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-related kinase kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and calpain, do not inhibit conjugation. Inhibitors of phospholipase C and protein kinase C block conjugation of both wild-type and ZAP-70-deficient cells, suggesting that a phospholipase C that does not depend on ZAP-70 for its activation is involved. These results are not restricted to Jurkat T cells; Ag-specific primary T cell blasts behave similarly. Although the way in which Lck signals to enhance LFA-1-dependent adhesion is not clear, we find that cells lacking functional Lck fail to recruit F-actin and LFA-1 to the T cell:APC contact site, whereas ZAP-70-deficient cells show a milder phenotype characterized by disorganized actin and LFA-1 at the contact site.
11950877	Dissecting interactions between EB1, microtubules and APC in cortical clusters at the plasma membrane.	End-binding protein (EB) 1 binds to the C-terminus of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein and to the plus ends of microtubules (MT) and has been implicated in the regulation of APC accumulation in cortical clusters at the tip of extending membranes. We investigated which APC domains are involved in cluster localization and whether binding to EB1 or MTs is essential for APC cluster localization. Armadillo repeats of APC that lack EB1- and MT-binding domains are necessary and sufficient for APC localization in cortical clusters; an APC fragment lacking the armadillo repeats, but containing MT- and EB1-binding domains, does not localize to the cortical clusters but instead co-aligns with MTs throughout the cell. Significantly, analysis of endogenous proteins reveals that EB1 does not accumulate in the APC clusters. However, overexpressed EB1 does accumulate in APC clusters; the APC-binding domain in EB1 is located in the C-terminal region of EB1 between amino acids 134 and 268. Overexpressed APC- or MT-binding domains of EB1 localize to APC cortical clusters and MT, respectively, without affecting APC cluster formation itself. These results show that localization of APC in cortical clusters is different from that of EB1 at MT plus ends and appears to be independent of EB1.
10851428	Constitutive expression of interferon beta in differentiated epithelial cells exposed to environmental stimuli.	The body's first line of defense against external challenge are the epithelial cells that line the skin and the respiratory, digestive, and genitourinary tracts. Inasmuch as interferon-beta (IFN-beta) participates in host defense against viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections and tumors, we hypothesized that this secreted protein is expressed in various murine epithelial cell types that line portals of entry to the body. We used immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization techniques to measure IFN-beta expression in the various epithelial cell types and in internal murine organs sheltered from environmental stimuli. The epithelial cell types lining the skin, digestive tract, urinary tract, reproductive tract, and upper respiratory tract constitutively expressed IFN-beta. Specifically, all differentiated epithelial cells at risk of environmental exposure expressed IFN-beta (protein and mRNA) with the exception of the ciliated epithelial cells lining the lower respiratory tract. Epithelial cells of internal organs that are not directly exposed to external pathogens did not express IFN-beta.
11052523	Rectosigmoidal adenomatous polyposis: a novel entity of polyposis? Report of a case.	PURPOSE: We report a patient with rectosigmoidal adenomatous polyposis. METHODS: A 57-year-old male presented with a submucosally invasive well-differentiated adenocarcinoma in the rectum and approximately 100 adenomatous polyps with an extremely unusual distribution limited exclusively to the rectum and sigmoid colon. RESULTS: There was no family history of colorectal disease or any related disorders. No extracolonic manifestations were found. Because this case was considered to be a discriminative phenotype of familial adenomatous polyposis, DNA from a peripheral sample of whole blood was screened for APC germline mutation by a combination of protein truncation test and single stranded conformation polymorphism, but no mutation was found. CONCLUSION: This patient may have a novel entity of adenomatous polyposis with a peculiar distribution. It may be caused by some genetic alteration other than APC mutation.
11943771	A genomic and proteomic analysis of activation of the human neutrophil by lipopolysaccharide and its mediation by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.	Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) evokes several functional responses in the neutrophil that contribute to innate immunity. Although certain responses, such as adhesion and synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, are inhibited by pretreatment with an inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, others, such as actin assembly, are unaffected. The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes in neutrophil gene transcription and protein expression following lipopolysaccharide exposure and to establish their dependence on p38 signaling. Microarray analysis indicated expression of 13% of the 7070 Affymetrix gene set in nonstimulated neutrophils, and LPS up-regulation of 100 distinct genes, including cytokines and chemokines, signaling molecules, and regulators of transcription. Proteomic analysis yielded a separate list of up-regulated modulators of inflammation, signaling molecules, and cytoskeletal proteins. Poor concordance between mRNA transcript and protein expression changes was noted. Pretreatment with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 attenuated 23% of LPS-regulated genes and 18% of LPS-regulated proteins by > or = 40%. This study indicates that p38 plays a selective role in regulation of neutrophil transcripts and proteins following lipopolysaccharide exposure, clarifies that several of the effects of lipopolysaccharide are post-transcriptional and post-translational, and identifies several proteins not previously reported to be involved in the innate immune response.
12598901	Mutated APC and Asef are involved in the migration of colorectal tumour cells.	The tumour suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is mutated in sporadic and familial colorectal tumours. APC binds to beta-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signalling pathway, and induces its degradation. APC interacts with microtubules and accumulates at their plus ends in membrane protrusions, and associates with the plasma membrane in an actin-dependent manner. In addition, APC interacts with the Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor Asef and stimulates its activity, thereby regulating the actin cytoskeletal network and cell morphology. Here we show that overexpression of Asef decreases E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and promotes the migration of epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Both of these activities are stimulated by truncated APC proteins expressed in colorectal tumour cells. Experiments based on RNA interference and dominant-negative mutants show that both Asef and mutated APC are required for the migration of colorectal tumour cells expressing truncated APC. These results suggest that the APC-Asef complex functions in cell migration as well as in E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, and that truncated APC present in colorectal tumour cells contributes to their aberrant migratory properties.
10692769	The role of the E-cadherin/catenin complex in gastrointestinal cancer.	Cancer is a genetic disease. The unstable genome of cancer cells causes tumour progression through multiple alterations in suppressor and promoter genes, leading to loss of homeostatic and gain of oncogenic functions. Invasion is the critical step in the acquisition of malignancy. It implicates a continuous molecular conversation of the cancer cells with other cells and with the extracellular matrix in which adhesion molecules are crucial. One of these, E-cadherin, is discussed in the present review. E-cadherin is a transmembrane glycoprotein that forms a complex with cytoplasmic proteins, termed catenins because they link E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton. E-cadherin/catenin-mediated intercellular adhesion and communication is mainly homophylic homotypic. There is compelling evidence from experiments in vitro as well as in vivo to accept that the E-cadherin/catenin complex acts as an invasion suppressor. The mechanism of this action is not only through cell-cell adhesion but also through transduction of signals to the cell's motility system. In the replication error positive human colon cancer cell line HCT-8, the alpha E-catenin gene CTNNA1 is an invasion suppressor gene. Here, the transition from the non-invasive to the invasive state was prevented by introduction into the unstable non-invasive cells of either an extra CTNNA1 or a wild type hMSH6 mismatch repair gene. beta-catenin also participates at a complex which comprises the adenomatous polyposis cancer protein APC. In colorectal cancer, mutation of either APC or beta-catenin is oncogenic. Downregulation of the E-cadherin/catenin complex may occur in several ways amongst which are gene mutations, methylation of 5'CpG dinucleotides within the promotor region of E-cadherin, tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin, cell surface expression of proteoglycans sterically hindering E-cadherin and proteolytic release of fragments from the extracellular part of E-cadherin. Upregulation of the E-cadherin/catenin complex has been realized with a series of agents, some of which can be used therapeutically. In most human gastrointestinal cancers the E-cadherin/catenin or related complexes are disturbed and this underscores their pivotal role in the progression of these tumours. Mutations of the E-cadherin gene, including germline mutations, occur in diffuse gastric carcinoma, CpG methylation around the promotor region of E-cadherin in hepatocellular carcinomas and mutations of the APC tumour suppressor gene or in the beta-catenin oncogene in most colorectal cancers. The literature agrees about the disturbance of immunohistochemical patterns of E-cadherin and catenin expression in gastrointestinal cancers. Conflicting opinions do, however, exist about the prognostic value of such immunohistochemical aberrations. We doubt that immunohistochemistry of E-cadherin or catenins add prognostic value to the already used histological grading systems. In our opinion the major benefit from understanding of the E-cadherin/catenin-mediated pathways of invasion will be the development of new anti-invasive treatment strategies.
11076862	Contigs built with fingerprints, markers, and FPC V4.7.	Contigs have been assembled, and over 2800 clones selected for sequencing for human chromosomes 9, 10 and 13. Using the FPC (FingerPrinted Contig) software, the contigs are assembled with markers and complete digest fingerprints, and the contigs are ordered and localised by a global framework. Publicly available resources have been used, such as, the 1998 International Gene Map for the framework and the GSC Human BAC fingerprint database for the majority of the fingerprints. Additional markers and fingerprints are generated in-house to supplement this data. To support the scale up of building maps, FPC V4.7 has been extended to use markers with the fingerprints for assembly of contigs, new clones and markers can be automatically added to existing contigs, and poorly assembled contigs are marked accordingly. To test the automatic assembly, a simulated complete digest of 110 Mb of concatenated human sequence was used to create datasets with varying coverage, length of clones, and types of error. When no error was introduced and a tolerance of 7 was used in assembly, the largest contig with no false positive overlaps has 9534 clones with 37 out-of-order clones, that is, the starting coordinates of adjacent clones are in the wrong order. This paper describes the new features in FPC, the scenario for building the maps of chromosomes 9, 10 and 13, and the results from the simulation.
11160183	The dendritic cell cytoskeleton is critical for the formation of the immunological synapse.	The binding of a T cell to an APC results in T cell actin cytoskeletal rearrangement leading to the formation of an immunological synapse. The APC cytoskeleton has been thought to play a passive role in this process. In this study, we demonstrate that dendritic cells (DC), unlike other APC, actively polarize their actin cytoskeleton during interaction with T cells. DC cytoskeletal rearrangement was critical for both the clustering and the activation of resting T cells. This study provides compelling evidence that the APC cytoskeleton plays an active role in the immunological synapse and may explain the unique ability of DC to activate resting T cells.
11689125	A cGMP-dependent protein kinase assay for high throughput screening based on time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer.	Activation of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) is an important event in the regulation of blood pressure and platelet function. Upstream signals are the generation of nitric oxide (NO) by NO synthases and the subsequent rise in cyclic GMP levels mediated by NO-dependent guanylyl cyclases (GCs). The identification of new cGK activators by high throughput screening (HTS) may lead to the development of a novel class of therapeutics for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, a homogeneous, nonradioactive assay for cGK activity was developed using a biotinylated peptide derived from vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), a well-characterized natural cGK substrate. The phosphorylated peptide could be detected by a VASP-specific monoclonal phosphoserine antibody and a fluorescent detection system consisting of a europium-labeled secondary antibody and allophycocyanin (APC)-labeled streptavidin. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from europium to APC was detected in a time-resolved fashion (TR-FRET). Activation and inhibition constants for known substances determined by this new fluorescence-based assay correlated well with published results obtained by conventional radioactive cGK activity assays. The assay proved to be sensitive, robust, highly specific for cGK, and suitable for HTS in 96- and 384-well formats. This assay is applicable to purified enzymes as well as to complex samples such as human platelet extracts.
11983341	Molecular diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP): genotyping of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) alleles by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.	OBJECTIVES: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominantly inherited colorectal cancer predisposition syndrome caused by germ line mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC). For prophylactic colectomy, timely identification of patients at risk is urgent. Here, matrix assisted laser desorption ionization - time of flight - mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) genotyping is offered for an efficient molecular diagnosis of APC germline mutations. DESIGN AND METHODS: The four most frequent APC germ line mutations (three deletions, one point mutation) were genotyped by allele specific elongation and termination of extension primers. The extension products generated were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. RESULTS: Following PCR amplification and allele specific primer extension reactions MALDI-TOF-MS allowed the unambiguous identification of informative nucleic acid fragments corresponding to distinct genotypes or mutants even in duplex assays. Results were confirmed by DNA-sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: Due to its high molecular resolution and accuracy, this method is highly suitable as an alternative for clinical APC genotyping.
8090754	A targeted chain-termination mutation in the mouse Apc gene results in multiple intestinal tumors.	Germ-line mutations in the human adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene result in familial adenomatous polyposis, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the early onset of multiple adenomatous polyps in the large bowel with a high likelihood of developing colorectal carcinomas. To understand the role of APC in intestinal tumor formation, we have introduced a chain-termination mutation in the 15th exon of the mouse Apc gene and employed it to modify the endogenous gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Mice which are heterozygous for the Apc gene modification progressively develop intestinal tumors in a manner that is similar to that observed in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and in mice which carry a mutation called multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min). Our results indicate that the Apc gene modification is a critical event in the initiation of intestinal tumor formation and results in an autosomal dominant predisposition toward development of spontaneous colonic and intestinal tumors in mice.
9504909	Dominant alleles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC20 reveal its role in promoting anaphase.	We identified an allele of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC20 that exhibits a spindle-assembly checkpoint defect. Previous studies indicated that loss of CDC20 function caused cell cycle arrest prior to the onset of anaphase. In contrast, CDC20-50 caused inappropriate cell cycle progression through M phase in the absence of mitotic spindle function. This effect of CDC20-50 was dominant over wild type and was eliminated by a second mutation causing loss of function, suggesting that it encodes an overactive form of Cdc20p. Overexpression of CDC20 was found to cause a similar checkpoint defect, causing bypass of the preanaphase arrest produced by either microtubule-depolymerizing compounds or MPS1 overexpression. CDC20 overexpression was also able to overcome the anaphase delay caused by high levels of the anaphase inhibitor Pds1p, but not a mutant form immune to anaphase-promoting complex- (APC-)mediated proteolysis. CDC20 overexpression was unable to promote anaphase in cells deficient in APC function. These findings suggest that Cdc20p is a limiting factor that promotes anaphase entry by antagonizing Pds1p. Cdc20p may promote the APC-dependent proteolytic degradation of Pds1p and other factors that act to inhibit cell cycle progression through mitosis.
9754306	[Cytoskeletal actin and its associated proteins. Some examples in Protista].	"Many processes, cell motility being an example, require cells to remodel the actin cytoskeleton in response to both intracellular and extracellular signals. Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton involves the rapid disassembly and reassembly of actin filaments, a phenomenon regulated by the action of particular actin-binding proteins. In recent years, an interest in studying actin regulation in unicellular organisms has arisen. Parasitic protozoan are among these organisms and studies of the cytoskeleton functions of these protozoan are relevant related to either cell biology or pathogenicity. To discuss recent data in this field, a symposium concerning ""Actin and actin-binding proteins in protists"" was held on May 8-11 in Paris, France, during the XXXV meeting of the French Society of Protistology. As a brief summary of the symposium we report here findings concerning the in vitro actin dynamic assembly, as well as the characterization of several actin-binding proteins from the parasitic protozoan Entamoeba histolytica, Trichomonas vaginalis and Plasmodium knowlesi. In addition, localization of actin in non-pathogen protists such as Prorocentrum micans and Crypthecodinium cohnii is also presented. The data show that some actin-binding proteins facilitate organization of filaments into higher order structures as pseudopods, while others have regulatory functions, indicating very particular roles for actin-binding proteins. One of the proteins discussed during the symposium, the actin depolymerizing factor ADF, was shown to enhance the treadmilling rate of actin filaments. In vitro, ADF binds to the ADP-bound forms of G-actin and F-actin, thereby participating in and changing the rate of actin assembly. Biochemical approaches allowed the identification of a protein complex formed by HSP/C70-cap32-34 which might also be involved in depolymerization of F-actin in P. knowlesi. Molecular and cellular approaches were used to identify proteins such as ABP-120 and myosin IB at the leading edge of E. histolytica. ABP-120 organizes F-actin in a network and myosin IB participates in the pseudopod formation. Similar approaches using T. vaginalis resulted in the discovery of an actin-binding protein that participate in the F-actin reorganization during adhesion of parasites to target cells. This protein is homologous to alpha-actinin from other eukaryotic cells. Finally, by using cell biology approaches, F-actin was observed in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus of Dinoflagellates. The recent developments in the molecular genetics of protozoa will provide new insights to understand the roles of actin-binding proteins during cytoskeleton activities."
11208096	Actin assembly plays a variable, but not obligatory role in receptor-mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells.	Three cell-permeant compounds, cytochalasin D, latrunculin A and jasplakinolide, which perturb intracellular actin dynamics by distinct mechanisms, were used to probe the role of filamentous actin and actin assembly in clathrin-mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells. These compounds had variable effects on receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin that depended on both the cell line and the experimental protocol employed. Endocytosis in A431 cells assayed in suspension was inhibited by latrunculin A and jaspiakinolide, but resistant to cytochalasin D, whereas neither compound inhibited endocytosis in adherent A431 cells. In contrast, endocytosis in adherent CHO cells was more sensitive to disruption of the actin cytoskeleton than endocytosis in CHO cells grown or assayed in suspension. Endocytosis in other cell types, including nonadherent K562 human erythroleukemic cells or adherent Cos-7 cells was unaffected by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. While it remains possible that actin filaments can play an accessory role in receptor-mediated endocytosis, these discordant results indicate that actin assembly does not play an obligatory role in endocytic coated vesicle formation in cultured mammalian cells.
11792550	Doing (F/L)PPPPs: EVH1 domains and their proline-rich partners in cell polarity and migration.	Actin filament assembly is a tightly regulated process that functions in many aspects of cell physiology. Members of the Ena/VASP (Drosophila Enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) family are key players in regulating actin filament assembly, in many cases through their association with binding partners that display a particular proline-rich motif, FPPPP. Ena/VASP proteins interact with these partners via the highly conserved Ena/VASP homology 1 (EVH1) domain. The diverse array of binding partners for EVH1 domains, including cytoskeletal proteins such as zyxin, transmembrane guidance receptors such as Roundabout, and the T-cell signaling protein Fyb/SLAP, shows that these interactions are likely to be important in a number of cellular processes that require regulated actin filament assembly.
7535398	Properties of isolated GABAB-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents in hippocampal pyramidal cells.	Whole-cell recording techniques were used to record isolated slow inhibitory postsynaptic currents in CA1 pyramidal neurons from rat hippocampal slices. Application of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione and 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid eliminated excitatory synaptic transmission, resulting in a 38% reduction in slow inhibitory postsynaptic current magnitude. Subsequent addition of the GABAA antagonist picrotoxin caused a further decrease in slow inhibitory postsynaptic current amplitude. The remaining, isolated slow inhibitory postsynaptic current was blocked by the GABAB antagonist 2-hydroxysaclofen and when cesium was substituted for intracellular potassium. The kinetics of isolated slow inhibitory postsynaptic currents were characterized by single exponential, fourth power activation, and double exponential inactivation. These slow inhibitory postsynaptic currents had a reversal potential of -85.7 +/- 1.6 mV, and a slope conductance of 935 +/- 277 pS. Single slow inhibitory postsynaptic currents carried a total charge flux of 13.4 +/- 7.6 pC. Repetitive stimulation up to 1 Hz progressively reduced steady-state slow inhibitory postsynaptic current amplitude. This attenuation was characterized by a decrease in slope conductance, but slow inhibitory postsynaptic current reversal potential remained unchanged, as did slow inhibitory postsynaptic current kinetics. These results indicate that, under physiological conditions, both ionotropic glutamate- and GABAA-mediated transmission contribute to slow inhibitory postsynaptic current recruitment. Given this finding, activity-dependent decreases in GABAA transmission could contribute to slow inhibitory postsynaptic current depression, though not exclusively, since isolated slow inhibitory postsynaptic currents also demonstrated this property. The use-dependent depression of isolated slow inhibitory postsynaptic currents may be a consequence of a reduction in transmitter release.
7568165	G protein activation kinetics and spillover of gamma-aminobutyric acid may account for differences between inhibitory responses in the hippocampus and thalamus.	We have developed a model of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic synaptic transmission mediated by GABAA and GABAB receptors, including cooperativity in the guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein) cascade mediating the activation of K+ channels by GABAB receptors. If the binding of several G proteins is needed to activate the K+ channels, then only a prolonged activation of GABAB receptors evoked detectable currents. This could occur if strong stimuli evoked release in adjacent terminals and the spillover resulted in prolonged activation of the receptors, leading to inhibitory responses similar to those observed in hippocampal slices. The same model also reproduced thalamic GABAB responses to high-frequency bursts of stimuli. In this case, prolonged activation of the receptors was due to high-frequency release conditions. This model provides insights into the function of GABAB receptors in normal and epileptic discharges.
7898776	Metabotropic glutamate receptor-induced disinhibition is mediated by reduced transmission at excitatory synapses onto interneurons and inhibitory synapses onto pyramidal cells.	Previous studies suggest that activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) reduces GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition in area CA1 of the hippocampus. However, the mechanisms involved in this disinhibition are not known. We report that mGluR activation reduces both the GABAA and GABAB receptor-mediated components of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) by reducing transmission at excitatory synapses onto inhibitory interneurons and inhibitory synapses onto CA1 pyramidal cells.
7907132	Hippocampal inhibitory interneurons are functionally disconnected from excitatory inputs by anoxia.	"1. The effects of anoxia on inhibitory synaptic transmission were studied in hippocampal slices of 3- to 4-wk-old rats. CA1 pyramidal cells were examined by whole-cell patch-clamp recording. Synaptic currents were evoked by ""distant"" (> 0.5 mm) or ""close"" (< 0.5 mm) electrical stimulation in the stratum radiatum. 2. The excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) evoked by distant stimulation were completely suppressed by brief anoxia (95% N2-5% CO2 for 4-6 min) and recovered upon reoxygenation. IPSCs were more sensitive to anoxia than EPSCs. EPSCs and IPSCs evoked by distant stimulation were blocked by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; 20 microM) and D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (APV; 50 microM). This indicates that IPSCs were mediated via a polysynaptic pathway that involves glutamate receptors. 3. Synaptic currents evoked by close stimulation were only partly inhibited by anoxia. The bicuculline-sensitive gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor-mediated synaptic currents were particularly resistant to anoxia, suggesting that the GABAergic input to pyramidal neurons is not inhibited by anoxia. 4. At close stimulation in the stratum radiatum, monosynaptic IPSCs could be evoked in the presence of CNQX (20 microM) and APV (50 microM). The monosynaptic IPSCs had early bicuculline (15 microM) and late CGP 35348 (100 microM)-sensitive components confirming an involvement of GABAA and GABAB receptors (IPSCA and IPSCB components), respectively. 5. The monosynaptic IPSCA component evoked by close stimulation was not changed significantly during and after brief anoxia. Responses to pressure application of isoguvacine (GABAA agonist) were also not affected by anoxia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
8730588	High-threshold Ca2+ currents in rat hippocampal interneurones and their selective inhibition by activation of GABA(B) receptors.	1. Whole-cell calcium currents were recorded from visually identified inhibitory interneurones located in stratum radiatum (near the border with stratum lacunosum-moleculare) of area. CA1 in rat hippocampal slices. Current-voltage (I-V) relationships in relatively well-clamped neurones showed that inward current activated between -50 and -40 mV (holding potential, -80 mV) and was maximal near -10 mV. Currents showed little inactivation over the course of 85 ms steps, and were completely blocked by removal of Ca2+ or addition of Cd2+. Prominent low-threshold currents were not observed under these conditions. 2. The calcium channels contributing to whole-cell currents in interneurones were examined using selective channel antagonists. The selective N-type calcium channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CgTX-GVIA; 10 microM) irreversibly blocked 23.2 +/- 2.8% of whole-cell currents. The P/Q-type antagonist omega-agatoxin IVA (omega-Aga-IVA; 1-5 microM) blocked 10.4 +/- 3.3% of whole-cell currents. Block by omega-Aga-IVA was highly variable, ranging from 0 to 30%. The less selective conotoxin, omega-conotoxin MVIIC (omega-CTX-MVIIC; 5 microM) blocked 31.0 +/- 2.7% of whole-cell currents. The selective L-type channel antagonist nifedipine (20 microM) blocked 27.5 +/- 3.5% of whole-cell currents. 3. Whole-cell calcium currents were reversibly inhibited by the selective GABA(B) receptor agonists (+/-)-baclofen or CGP 27492 (1-3 microM; 18.9 +/- 1.4%). This inhibition was reversed or prevented by the selective GABAB receptor antagonist CGP 55845A (1 microM). Inhibition of inward current activated by voltage ramps was voltage dependent, being greatest near -10 mV, and less pronounced at more positive or negative potentials. Inhibition of calcium currents by GABAB receptor agonists was accompanied by an apparent change in the kinetics of whole-cell currents consistent with a slowing of the rate of activation. CGP 27492 depressed calcium currents by 16.1 +/- 1.9% before application of omega-CgTX-GVIA, and by 3.9 +/- 2.0% after application of omega-CgTX-GVIA in the same cells (P < 0.005), consistent with preferential block of N-type calcium channels. 4. Neither adenosine (200 microM) nor the selective mu-opioid receptor agonist Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol (DAMGO; 2 microM) inhibited calcium currents. Similarly, CGP 27492, but not adenosine or DAMGO, induced an outward current (at - 70 mV) consistent with activation of inwardly rectifying potassium channels. 5. These results indicate that hippocampal inhibitory neurones located in stratum radiatum possess multiple calcium channel subtypes, including N-type, L-type, and at least two other types of high-threshold channels. Activation of GABAB receptors (but not adenosine or mu-opioid receptors) preferentially inhibits N-type channels in these neurones. Similar inhibition occurring in the terminals of interneurones could contribute to depression of inhibitory synaptic transmission by activation of GABAB autoreceptors.
8801474	Activation by GABAb, reduction of the intracellular concentration of Ca++, and inhibition of protein kinases are possible mechanisms of the long-term posttetanic modification of the efficiency of inhibitory transmission in the new cortex.	A hypothetical mechanism is proposed for the induction of long-term posttetanic potentiation of the efficiency of inhibitory synaptic transmission (LTPi). The data we have previously obtained have made it possible to hypothesize that modifiable inhibitory synapses are situated on the dendritic spines on which there are metabotropic GABAb receptors. It is hypothesized that modification of inhibitory transmission is determined precisely by these receptors, the activation of which leads to inactivation of protein kinases C and A (PKC and PKA) as a result of a decrease in the intracellular concentration of Ca++ and the inhibition of cAMP. The hypothesis is confirmed by experiments in which it was demonstrated that an effect similar to LTPi took place as a result of the inactivation of PKC and PKA. It is hypothesized that eicanoid [sic] acids may be retrograde messengers during LTPi. A new hypothetical mechanism underlying long-term depression of excitatory transmission (LTDe) is proposed, according to which tetanized afferent fibers must simultaneously monosynaptically excite and disynaptically inhibit one and the same postsynaptic cell. LTDe may be induced only in those pathways which activate [are activated by--unclear from Russian text--Trans.] GABAb receptors. The proposed hypothesis make it possible to explain the results of certain experiments.
8822545	Role of GABA receptor subtypes in inhibition of primate spinothalamic tract neurons: difference between spinal and periaqueductal gray inhibition.	1. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is thought to inhibit both pre- and postsynaptically the transfer of nociceptive signals from primary afferent fibers to spinal dorsal horn sensory cells, including spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons. The inhibition can be mediated by both GABAA and GABAB receptors. We now attempt to characterize the synaptic inhibition of STT cells by spinal GABAA and GABAB receptors in anesthetized monkeys and to analyze the roles of these two receptor subtypes in the inhibition of STT cellular activity produced by stimulation in the periaqueductal gray (PAG). 2. Iontophoretic release of GABA or muscimol (a selective GABAA receptor agonist) onto STT cells elicited a profound and dose-related inhibition of the responses of all cells tested to noxious cutaneous stimuli. Only four cells (16.7%) were found to be inhibited when baclofen (a selective GABAB receptor agonist) was applied iontophoretically. However, a strong and dose-dependent inhibition of the responses to cutaneous mechanical and thermal stimuli was obtained in all cells examined when baclofen was administered into the dorsal horn through a microdialysis fiber. The inhibitory effects were mainly on nociceptive inputs. 3. The inhibition of cellular activity by GABAA and GABAB agonists could be selectively antagonized by specific antagonists applied through a microdialysis fiber. 4. The excitatory responses evoked by pulsed release of glutamic acid (GLUT) were also inhibited in a dose-related manner by iontophoretic application of GABA and muscimol, but not by baclofen. A high dose of baclofen administered by microdialysis resulted in only a small decrease in GLUT-evoked excitatory responses. 5. Infusion of GABAA and GABAB antagonists into the dorsal horn by microdialysis caused an increase in both background activity and responses to cutaneous stimuli, suggesting that there is a tonic GABAergic inhibition of STT cells. 6. The inhibition of responses to mechanical and thermal stimulation of the cutaneous excitatory receptive field resulting from stimulation in PAG was significantly antagonized in most of the STT cells tested when the GABAA antagonist bicuculline was infused into the spinal dorsal horn through a microdialysis fiber. In contrast, the inhibition produced by PAG stimulation in most of the cells examined was not significantly antagonized by the GABAB antagonists phaclofen or 3-amino-propyl(diethoxymethyl)phophinic acid (CGP35348) administered into the spinal dorsal horn by microdialysis. 7. Our results support the contention that GABAergic mechanisms in the spinal dorsal horn normally exert a tonic modulation of nociceptive inputs through both GABAA and GABAB receptors. The evidence provided here indicates that GABAA receptors located on primate STT neurons contribute to a postsynaptic inhibitory effect on the transmission of peripheral nociceptive inputs. A possible presynaptic GABAA action was not investigated. Our finding of a GABAB-receptor-mediated inhibition is consistent with the view that both pre- and postsynaptic GABAB receptors are involved in inhibitory modulation of spinal nociceptive transmission. Finally, it is suggested from this study that primate spinal GABAA, but not GABAB receptors, are involved in mediating the descending inhibition induced by PAG stimulation.
9242288	GABAergic modulation of hippocampal population activity: sequence learning, place field development, and the phase precession effect.	"A detailed biophysical model of hippocampal region CA3 was constructed to study how GABAergic modulation influences place field development and the learning and recall of sequence information. Simulations included 1,000 multicompartmental pyramidal cells, each consisting of seven intrinsic and four synaptic currents, and 200 multicompartmental interneurons, consisting of two intrinsic and four synaptic currents. Excitatory rhythmic septal input to the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells and both excitatory and inhibitory input to interneurons at theta frequencies provided a cellular basis for the development of theta and gamma frequency oscillations in population activity. The fundamental frequency of theta oscillations was dictated by the driving rhythm from the septum. Gamma oscillation frequency, however, was determined by both the decay time of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA(A))-receptor-mediated synaptic current and the overall level of excitability in interneurons due to alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole proprionic acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor-gated channel activation. During theta population activity, total GABA(B)-receptor-mediated conductance levels were found to gradually rise and fall in rhythmic fashion with the predominant population frequency (theta rhythm). This resulted in periodic GABA(B)-receptor-mediated suppression of excitatory synaptic transmission at recurrent collaterals (intrinsic fibers) of pyramidal cells and suppression of inhibitory synaptic transmission to both pyramidal cells and interneurons. To test the ability of the model to learn and recall temporal sequence information, a completion task was employed. During learning, the network was presented a sequence of nonorthogonal spatial patterns. Each input pattern represented a spatial ""location"" of a simulated rat running a specific navigational path. Hebbian-type learning was expressed as an increase in postsynaptic NMDA-receptor-mediated conductances. Because of several factors including the sparse, asymmetric excitatory synaptic connections among pyramidal cells in the model and a sufficient degree of random ""background"" firing unrelated to the input patterns, repeated simulated runs resulted in the gradual emergence of place fields where a given cell began to respond to a contiguous segment of locations on the path. During recall, the simulated rat was placed at a random location on the previously learned path and tested to see whether the sequence of locations could be completed on the basis of this initial position. Periodic GABA(B)-receptor-mediated suppression of excitatory and inhibitory transmission at intrinsic but not afferent fibers resulted in sensory information about location being dominant during early portions of each theta cycle when GABA(B)-receptor-related effects were highest. This suppression declined with levels of GABA(B) receptor activation toward the end of a theta cycle, resulting in an increase in synaptic transmission at intrinsic fibers and the subsequent recall of a segment of the entire location sequence. This scenario typically continued across theta cycles until the full sequence was recalled. When the GABA(B)-receptor-mediated suppression of excitatory and inhibitory transmission at intrinsic fibers was not included in the model, place field development was curtailed and the network consequently exhibited poor learning and recall performance. This was, in part, due to increased competition of information from intrinsic and afferent fibers during early portions of each theta cycle. Because afferent sensory information did not dominate early in each cycle, the current location of the rat was obscured by ongoing activity from intrinsic sources. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)"
9310450	Neuropeptide Y suppresses epileptiform activity in rat hippocampus in vitro.	Neuropeptide Y (NPY) potently inhibits glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission in areas CA1 and CA3 of the rat hippocampus without affecting other synaptic inputs onto principal cells of the hippocampal formation, suggesting that its biological role may include the regulation of excitability within the hippocampus. Here we examine NPY's actions in three in vitro models of epilepsy [0 Mg2+-, picrotoxin-, and stimulus-train-induced bursting (STIB)] with the use of extracellular and whole cell patch-clamp recordings from rat hippocampal-entorhinal cortex slices. Perfusion of the slice with saline that had Mg2+ omitted (0 Mg2+) or that had picrotoxin (100 microM) added resulted in brief spontaneous bursts (SBs) resembling interictal discharges. SB frequency is significantly reduced in both models by 1 microM NPY and by the Y2-preferring agonists peptide (P)YY(3-36) (1 microM) and 1-4-(6-aminohexanoic acid)-25-36 ([ahx(5-24)] NPY; 3 microM). The Y1-preferring agonist Leu31-Pro34NPY (1 microM) is considerably less potent, but also reduces burst frequency, even in the presence of the selective Y1 receptor antagonist GR231118, suggesting the involvement of a different receptor. In STIB, high-frequency stimulus trains to stratum radiatum of area CA2/CA3 result in clonic or tonic-clonic ictaform primary afterdischarges (primary ADs) as well as longer, spontaneous secondary ictaform discharges and SBs similar to those in the other models. Primary AD duration is greatly reduced or abolished by Y2- but not Y1-preferring agonists. SBs, although variable, were inhibited by both Y1 and Y2 agonists. In single and dual whole cell recordings from CA3 pyramidal cells, we frequently observed spontaneous, rhythmic synchronous events (SRSEs) arising after several STIB stimuli. Once established, SRSEs persist in the absence of further stimuli and are insensitive to the application of NPY. SRSEs in pyramidal cells typically occur at 2-4 Hz, are outward currents when cells are clamped near rest (>100 pA at a holding potential of -55 mV), reverse between -60 and -70 mV, and are inhibited by 100 microM picrotoxin, indicating involvement of gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptors. They are inhibited by blockers of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) but not N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings from interneurons in CA3 after STIB reveal NPY-insensitive, rhythmic, inward AMPA-receptor-mediated currents that are similar in frequency to SRSEs seen in pyramidal cells. We conclude that NPY, acting predominantly via Y2 receptors, can dramatically inhibit epileptiform activity in three fundamentally different in vitro models of epilepsy without affecting endogenous inhibitory activity. The results also provide support for the hypothesis that endogenous NPY may normally control excitability in the hippocampus and suggest the potential for NPY receptors as targets for anticonvulsant therapy.
9862934	Neuronal discriminator formed by metabotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors.	Neuronal discriminator formed by metabotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors. J. Neurophysiol. 80: 3365-3368, 1998. Neurotransmitters function in one of two modes, promoting either inhibition or excitation. However, the metabotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABABR) system can switch between these modes. In the presence of a small excitatory stimulus, the GABABR mediates a shunting inhibition that suppresses excitation. However, in the presence of a strong excitatory stimulus, the GABABR potentiates the response. This bipartite action is accomplished by linking the GABABR to two electrogenic mechanisms; one activates an outward current and another reduces an outward current. As a consequence, the GABABR serves as a discriminator that reduces the influence of weak signals while augmenting responses to strong signals. In retinal ganglion cells, this mechanism acts to promote the communication of phasic information.
10381800	Ethanol directly depresses AMPA and NMDA glutamate currents in spinal cord motor neurons independent of actions on GABAA or glycine receptors.	Ethanol is a general anesthetic agent as defined by abolition of movement in response to noxious stimulation. This anesthetic endpoint is due to spinal anesthetic actions. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that ethanol acts directly on motor neurons to inhibit excitatory synaptic transmission at glutamate receptors. Whole cell recordings were made in visually identified motor neurons in spinal cord slices from 14- to 23-day-old rats. Currents were evoked by stimulating a dorsal root fragment or by brief pulses of glutamate. Ethanol at general anesthetic concentrations (50-200 mM) depressed both responses. Ethanol also depressed glutamate-evoked responses in the presence of tetrodotoxin (300 nM), showing that its actions are postsynaptic. Block of inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acidA and glycine receptors by bicuculline (50 microM) and strychnine (5 microM), respectively, did not significantly reduce the effects of ethanol on glutamate currents. Ethanol also depressed glutamate-evoked currents when the inhibitory receptors were blocked and either D, L-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (40 microM) or 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione disodium (10 microM) were applied to block N-methyl-D-aspartate or alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid/kainate receptors, respectively. The results show that ethanol exerts direct depressant effects on both alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate currents in motor neurons. Enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acidA and glycine inhibition is not required for this effect. Direct depression of glutamatergic excitatory transmission by a postsynaptic action on motor neurons thus may contribute to general anesthesia as defined by immobility in response to a noxious stimulus.
10514831	Parental imprinting and Angelman syndrome.	Angelman syndrome is an inherited disorder that includes severe mental retardation and epilepsy. Patients have no speech, puppet-like gait with jerky movements, hyperactivity, disturbed sleep, bouts of inappropriate laughter, a pronounced jaw, and widely spaced teeth. The syndrome results from deletion or mutation within maternal chromosome 15q11-q13. Considerable evidence suggests that the gene or genes responsible for Angelman syndrome are expressed only from the maternal chromosome 15, a situation known as parental imprinting. This epigenetic marking of certain regions of the parental genomes is characterized by parent-of-origin-specific allelic DNA methylation, allele-specific DNA replication timing, and physical pairing of the two chromosome 15 homologues. Imprinting is important for normal development, and its disregulation causes several human disorders. The epilepsy of Angelman syndrome has been studied and indicates a rather typical electroencephalographic abnormality with slowing and notched wave and spikes. Various types of seizures occur, usually including myoclonus and atypical absence. Variable severity among patients suggests potential molecular diversity in the genetic mechanism, possibly the involvement of more than one gene. Angelman syndrome can arise from the following molecular genetic defects: a deletion in 15q11-q13 that covers the Angelman gene or genes, mutations that alter imprinting, and paternal uni-parental disomy for the region. Another 20% or so of patients with clinical symptoms of Angelman syndrome have none of these three defects but are believed to have mutations in one or more genes in the region, and this may be familial. The UBE3A gene, which codes for the enzyme ubiquitin protein ligase involved in protein degradation and processing, has been found to be mutated in many but not all of patients with Angelman syndrome and can be considered a major Angelman candidate gene. Other potential candidate genes in the region include a cluster of three GABAA receptor subunits, which are involved in inhibitory synaptic transmission in the brain. The GABRB3 gene, which codes for the beta 3 subunit, is deleted in most persons with Angelman syndrome. The absence of this gene in mice causes craniofacial abnormalities and neurologic impairment with seizures. The exact role of UBE3A and GABRB3 in the syndrome and their imprinting status are under investigation.
11067972	Slow synaptic inhibition mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptor activation of GIRK channels.	Glutamate is the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate CNS. Ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate fast excitatory actions whereas metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) mediate a variety of slower effects. For example, mGluRs can mediate presynaptic inhibition, postsynaptic excitation, or, more rarely, postsynaptic inhibition. We previously described an unusually slow form of postsynaptic inhibition in one class of projection neuron in the song-control nucleus HVc of the songbird forebrain. These neurons, which participate in a circuit that is essential for vocal learning, exhibit an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) that lasts several seconds. Only a portion of this slow IPSP is mediated by GABA(B) receptors. Since these cells are strongly hyperpolarized by agonists of mGluRs, we used intracellular recording from brain slices to investigate the mechanism of this hyperpolarization and to determine whether mGluRs contribute to the slow synaptic inhibition. We report that mGluRs hyperpolarize these HVc neurons by activating G protein-coupled, inwardly-rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. MGluR antagonists blocked this response and the slow synaptic inhibition. Thus, glutamate can combine with GABA to mediate slow synaptic inhibition by activating GIRK channels in the CNS.
12367604	Pre- and postsynaptic properties of somatic and dendritic inhibition in dentate gyrus.	We compared somatic and dendritic inhibition in paired recordings from two classes of anatomically identified interneurons and granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) amplitude and decay were remarkably similar at somatic and dendritic synapses. Slower IPSC rise times and longer latencies at dendritic synapses were consistent with their distal location, without requiring differences in postsynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor properties. In contrast, higher transmission failure rate and greater paired-pulse depression at dendritic synapses suggest that somatic and dendritic inhibition differ in presynaptic properties. Cholinergic input has been suggested to modulate hippocampal rhythmicity as well as episodic memory function. We therefore tested the effects of acetylcholine (ACh) on paired IPSCs and on spontaneous synaptic activity in interneurons and granule cells. We found no effect of ACh on paired IPSCs; however, spontaneous IPSCs recorded in granule cells were enhanced in amplitude and frequency. ACh potentiated spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials (sEPSPs) and induced spiking in both types of interneuron, and preferentially increased sEPSP frequency in dendritic interneurons. Our findings suggest that patterns of activity in the two classes of interneurons, coupled with differences in their presynaptic properties, are likely to determine the roles of somatic and dendritic inhibition in network function.
12415111	Altered kinetics and benzodiazepine sensitivity of a GABAA receptor subunit mutation [gamma 2(R43Q)] found in human epilepsy.	The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor mediates fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in the CNS. Dysfunction of the GABA(A) receptor would be expected to cause neuronal hyperexcitability, a phenomenon linked with epileptogenesis. We have investigated the functional consequences of an arginine-to-glutamine mutation at position 43 within the GABA(A) gamma(2)-subunit found in a family with childhood absence epilepsy and febrile seizures. Rapid-application experiments performed on receptors expressed in HEK-293 cells demonstrated that the mutation slows GABA(A) receptor deactivation and increases the rate of desensitization, resulting in an accumulation of desensitized receptors during repeated, short applications. In Xenopus laevis oocytes, two-electrode voltage-clamp analysis of steady-state currents obtained from alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2) or alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2)(R43Q) receptors did not reveal any differences in GABA sensitivity. However, differences in the benzodiazepine pharmacology of mutant receptors were apparent. Mutant receptors expressed in oocytes displayed reduced sensitivity to diazepam and flunitrazepam but not the imidazopyridine zolpidem. These results provide evidence of impaired GABA(A) receptor function that could decrease the efficacy of transmission at inhibitory synapses, possibly generating a hyperexcitable neuronal state in thalamocortical networks of epileptic patients possessing the mutant subunit.
12582069	Roles of inhibitory interneurons in the cerebellar cortex.	The roles of inhibitory interneurons in the cerebellar cortex were investigated. First, Golgi cells were specifically eliminated in transgenic mice in which Golgi cells expressed human interleukin-2 receptor alpha subunit (IL2Ralpha). Injection of exotoxin coupled to anti-IL2Ralpha antibody in the cerebellum of the transgenic mouse eliminated Golgi cells and abolished GABA and synaptic inhibition in the granular layer. After elimination of Golgi cells, acute severe ataxia and subsequent mild motor discoordination were observed. In the latter chronic phase, NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic response was reduced in granule cells. Our findings indicate that elimination of GABAergic inhibition in the granular layer caused overexcitation of granule cells resulting in severe ataxia, and then NMDA receptors in granule cells were downregulated, compensating for the reduction of GABAergic inhibition and improving motor control. In the second part, we report on the regulation mechanism of synaptic plasticity at inhibitory synapses on Purkinje cells (PCs). Inhibitory synaptic transmission on a PC is potentiated after repetitive PC depolarization. This synaptic plasticity (rebound potentiation, RP) was suppressed when a presynaptic neuron was activated during the PC depolarization. This synaptic regulation is unique in the sense that the homosynaptic activity suppresses the induction of synaptic plasticity. The mechanism of how presynaptic activity suppresses RP was examined. GABA released from the presynaptic terminal activated not only GABA(A) receptor but also GABA(B) receptor. The latter was coupled to Gi/o proteins, which downregulated adenylyl cyclase reducing cAMP and inactivated cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Downregulation of PKA suppressed RP induction.
7757408	In vitro development of vertebrate central synapses.	This article deals with basic determinants of synaptic efficacy during development of glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission: location and number of release sites, release probability and single cell-activated (unitary) conductances. We hypothesize that both types of neuronal connections differ in major aspects of synaptogenesis. Disregarding the fact that various test models and cell types could render diverging results, it can be observed that glutamatergic terminals display a preference for dendrites, whereas GABAergic terminals select soma locations at initial stages of development. Glutamatergic synapses are characterised by receptor accumulation in the region of terminal apposition, whereas in GABAergic synapses receptor concentration is weak, if present at all. The expression of glutamate receptors (GluRs), but not GABAA receptors is under control of interneurons. Developmental changes in glutamatergic synaptic transmission have not yet been assessed by quantal analysis. For GABAergic synapses, first results are now available from a culture preparation of the rat superior colliculus. In general terms, functional maturation seemed to lag behind the formation of structurally differentiated release sites. Compound binomial analysis revealed that during in vitro development a considerable fraction of GABAergic terminals remained in a low efficacy release state (p < 0.2). A developmental increase in synaptic strength was reached by the appearance of singular highly effective release sites. Presynaptic maturation could be manipulated by long-term drug treatment. Addition of GluR antagonists significantly increased amplitudes and decreased the coefficients of variations of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Thus, the strength of inhibitory synaptic transmission could be influenced by the status of heteronymous synaptic input.
7820683	Selective suppression of intrinsic but not afferent fiber synaptic transmission by baclofen in the piriform (olfactory) cortex.	The GABAB agonist baclofen has been shown to suppress synaptic transmission in subregions of the hippocampus and in the piriform (olfactory) cortex. Here we report a laminar selectivity of suppression of synaptic potentials in the olfactory cortex. In brain slice preparations, baclofen suppresses extracellularly recorded field potentials at the intrinsic fiber synapses proximal to the superficial pyramidal cell bodies (layer Ib) while leaving the afferent fiber synaptic potentials recorded at the distal dendrites (layer Ia) little affected. This dose-dependent selective suppression of intrinsic fiber synaptic transmission is also correlated with an increase of paired-pulse facilitation. These results suggest that afferent and intrinsic synaptic inputs may be differentially modulated by the activation of GABAB receptors and that this selective suppression is at least partially mediated via a presynaptic mechanism.
7931577	GABAB receptors modulate an omega-conotoxin-sensitive calcium current that is required for synaptic transmission in the Xenopus embryo spinal cord.	Activation of GABAB receptors in the Xenopus embryo, a simple vertebrate, causes presynaptic inhibition of transmitter release from glycinergic spinal neurons and an increase in action potential threshold. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of GABAB receptor action, we have made whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from acutely isolated Xenopus embryo spinal neurons. The GABAB receptor agonist baclofen caused a reversible reduction in the amplitude of Ca2+ currents. This reduction of Ca2+ currents appeared to be voltage dependent as it was removed at very positive potentials. Since the specific GABAB antagonists CGP35348, phaclofen, and 2-hydroxysaclofen all blocked the reduction in Ca2+ currents, we concluded that the modulation of the Ca2+ current was mediated by GABAB receptors. We have investigated the pharmacological identity of the Ca2+ current modulated by baclofen using the selective blocker omega-conotoxin, fraction GVIA (omega-CgTX). omega-CgTX selectively blocked voltage-gated Ca2+ currents without affecting the voltage-gated Na+ current. omega-CgTX substantially occluded the action of baclofen, suggesting that GABAB receptors modulate an omega-CgTX-sensitive Ca2+ current. Since GABAB receptors mediate presynaptic inhibition, we have studied the involvement of the omega-CgTX-sensitive Ca2+ current in synaptic transmission in the intact spinal cord. Inhibitory interneuron axons were stimulated to evoke monosynaptic IPSPs in motoneurons, and recorded intracellularly. Since omega-CgTX blocked inhibitory transmission, we concluded that the omega-CgTX-sensitive Ca2+ current plays an essential role in transmitter release. If modulation of this current were to occur in nerve terminals, it could contribute to the GABAB receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition of transmitter release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
8035237	Weak excitation and simultaneous inhibition induce long-term depression in hippocampal CA1 neurons.	1. Weak excitation to rat hippocampal CA1 neurons via Schaffer collaterals at a frequency of 0.1 or 0.2 Hz accompanied by repeated brief exposures to the inhibitory transmitter gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) causes a long-term depression (LTD, up to 90% of the control) of the stimulated pathway. This depression can be reversed by high-frequency stimulation. 2. Although inhibition is necessary for the induction of this LTD, the depression can be produced with either the GABAA or the GABAB receptor agonists. 3. This conjunctive LTD could not be blocked by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid. 4. It was, however, blocked by the metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist L-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid and (RS)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine, indicating that activation of a metabotropic glutamate receptor is necessary for the LTD. Induction also appeared to require an intracellular Ca2+ increase. 5. Because GABAergic inhibition often modulates glutamatergic transmission in the brain, we propose that this form of synaptic modification is of potential importance for neural plasticity.
8930365	Brain-derived peptides inhibit synaptic transmission via presynaptic GABAB receptors in CA1 area of rat hippocampal slices.	GABAB receptors form the basis of a powerful and versatile inhibitory system in the mammalian brain. Presynaptic and postsynaptic actions of GABAB receptors have been described in various brain regions, including the hippocampus. We report here on a novel pharmacological agent, presumably a peptide, which inhibits synaptic transmission in the CA1 area of the rat hippocampus via GABAB receptors. The agent is a component of a nootropic drug, Cerebrolysin, obtained from pig's brain extract. In contrast to other, presently known agonists, such as baclofen or GABA, Cerebrolysin acts preferentially on presynaptic GABAB receptors and has no detectable postsynaptic inhibitory effects. Additional, postsynaptic depolarizing action of the drug resulting in increased excitability is pharmacologically distinct from the GABAB response and partially masked by the inhibition. The presynaptic GABAB agonist may add to clinical effects of Cerebrolysin in treatment of brain injuries. Moreover, it promises to be a useful experimental agent in further studies of many possible functional roles of GABAB receptors.
9353566	Roles of gamma-aminobutyric acidB (GABA B) and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid receptors in hippocampal long-term potentiation and pathogenesis of absence seizures.	Experiments were performed to examine the roles of gamma-aminobutyric acid(B) (GABA(B)) and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) receptors in long-term potentiation (LTP) of the hippocampal CA1 region in vivo and in the genesis of the spike and wave discharges (SWDs) associated with absence seizures. When tetanic stimulation was delivered to the CA3 region, stable LTP was observed in the CA1 region in saline-treated mice. In mice treated with 5 mg/kg baclofen, the population spike amplitude was significantly potentiated by tetanic stimulation and the degree of potentiation was the same as that induced in saline controls. However, this potentiation decayed to the baseline level about 90 min after stimulation. The decay was reversed by pretreatment with 200 mg/kg P-[3-aminopropyl]-P-diethoxymethylphosphinic acid (CGP 35348), a selective GABA(B) receptor antagonist. In mice treated with 50 mg/kg gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), a prodrug of GHB, stable LTP was observed 90 min after tetanic stimulation and was greater than that in saline controls. GBL-induced potentiation of LTP was antagonized by 50 mg/kg NCS 382, a putative GHB receptor antagonist. Administration of baclofen (20 mg/kg) or GBL (70 mg/kg) induced absence-like seizures associated with 3-6 Hz SWDs, and CGP 35348 suppressed both baclofen- and GBL-induced SWDs. NCS 382 also attenuated SWDs induced by GBL and baclofen. These results suggest that baclofen and GHB have different effects on LTP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in vivo, although they have a common mode of action on the thalamocortical functions related to the pathogenesis of absence seizures.
9437016	Patch-clamp recordings from cerebellar basket cell bodies and their presynaptic terminals reveal an asymmetric distribution of voltage-gated potassium channels.	Cerebellar basket cells form highly specialized inhibitory synaptic contacts with Purkinje cells, namely the pericellular basket and pinceau nerve terminal structures, wrapping around the Purkinje cell somatic and axon hillock regions. These inhibitory synaptic contacts are ideally located to control the ultimate output of the cerebellar cortex. Previous immunohistochemical studies have shown that these synaptic structures possess a very high density of the dendrotoxin (DTX)-sensitive potassium channel subunit, Kv1.2. We have taken advantage of this unique anatomical arrangement offering a high concentration of identified Kv channel subunits by combining whole-cell patch-clamp recording and fluorescence microscopy to establish a novel preparation and perform the first recordings from unambiguously identified mammalian CNS inhibitory presynaptic terminals. We report that DTX-sensitive potassium channels are present in basket cell terminals but not in the basket cell soma. This selective cellular distribution suggests that these channels play an important role in modulating cerebellar inhibitory synaptic transmission.
9466452	GABA- and glycine-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in neonatal rat rostral ventrolateral medulla neurons in vitro.	Whole-cell patch recordings were made from rostral ventrolateral medulla neurons of two in vitro preparations: (i) brainstem spinal cords of two- to five-day-old rats, and (ii) coronal brainstem slices of eight- to 12-day-old rats, and the inhibitory synaptic activities in these neurons have been studied. In brainstem spinal cord preparations, Lucifer Yellow was diffused into the recording neurons at the end of experiments. Medullary neurons were characterized as: (i) spinally projecting by the appearance of an antidromic spike following electrical stimulation of the spinal tract between T2 and T3 segments, and (ii) adrenergic by the detection of phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase immunoreactivity in Lucifer Yellow-filled neurons. Of the 13 spinally projecting and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase-positive medullary neurons, focal stimulation elicited in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists an inhibitory postsynaptic potential in nine neurons. Inhibitory synaptic potentials were reversibly eliminated by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline (10-20 microM) in six of nine neurons, by the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine (0.1-1 microM) in two and by a combination of bicuculline and strychnine in one neuron. In brainstem slice preparations, focal stimulation elicited three types of synaptic potential: (i) an excitatory postsynaptic potential, (ii) an inhibitory postsynaptic potential and (iii) a biphasic synaptic potential consisting of an excitatory synaptic potential followed by an inhibitory synaptic potential. Inhibitory synaptic potentials had a reversal potential between -70 and -80 mV, reversed their polarity in a low (6.7 mM) Cl- Krebs' solution, and suppressed or blocked by either bicuculline or strychnine or both. Elimination of inhibitory synaptic potentials unmasked in some cells an excitatory synaptic potential or enhanced the excitatory synaptic potential component in medullary neurons with a biphasic response, indicating a marked convergence of excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto a single neuron. A population of medullary neurons appeared to be pacemaker neurons whereby they discharged spontaneously. When discharges were suppressed by membrane hyperpolarization, focal stimulation elicited inhibitory synaptic potentials in 8/23 neurons tested. Our results suggest that inhibitory synaptic potentials in medullary neurons are mediated by either GABA and/or glycine which open primarily Cl- channels. The prevalence of inhibitory synaptic potentials in medullary neurons indicates an essential role of inhibitory transmission in controlling the input and output ratio of these neurons.
9844003	Human gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptors are differentially expressed and regulate inwardly rectifying K+ channels.	gamma-Aminobutyric acid type B receptors (GABABRs) are involved in the fine tuning of inhibitory synaptic transmission. Presynaptic GABABRs inhibit neurotransmitter release by down-regulating high-voltage activated Ca2+ channels, whereas postsynaptic GABABRs decrease neuronal excitability by activating a prominent inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) conductance that underlies the late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. Here we report the cloning and functional characterization of two human GABABRs, hGABABR1a (hR1a) and hGABABR1b (hR1b). These receptors closely match the pharmacological properties and molecular weights of the most abundant native GABABRs. We show that in transfected mammalian cells hR1a and hR1b can modulate heteromeric Kir3.1/3.2 and Kir3.1/3.4 channels. Heterologous expression therefore supports the notion that Kir3 channels are the postsynaptic effectors of GABABRs. Our data further demonstrate that in principle either of the cloned receptors could mediate inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. We find that in the cerebellum hR1a and hR1b transcripts are largely confined to granule and Purkinje cells, respectively. This finding supports a selective association of hR1b, and not hR1a, with postsynaptic Kir3 channels. The mapping of the GABABR1 gene to human chromosome 6p21.3, in the vicinity of a susceptibility locus (EJM1) for idiopathic generalized epilepsies, identifies a candidate gene for inherited forms of epilepsy.
10369475	Comparison of antagonist potencies at pre- and post-synaptic GABA(B) receptors at inhibitory synapses in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus.	Synaptic activation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)B receptors at GABA synapses causes (a) postsynaptic hyperpolarization mediating a slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential/current (IPSP/C) and (b) presynaptic inhibition of GABA release which depresses IPSPs and leads to paired-pulse widening of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). To address whether these effects are mediated by pharmacologically identical receptors the effects of six GABA(B) receptor antagonists of widely ranging potencies were tested against each response. Monosynaptic IPSP(B)s were recorded in the presence of GABA(A), AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptor antagonists. All GABA(B) receptor antagonists tested depressed the IPSP(B) with an IC50 based rank order of potency of CGP55679> or =CGP56433 = CGP55845A = CGP52432>CGP51176>CGP36742. Paired-pulse EPSP widening was recorded as an index of paired-pulse depression of GABA-mediated IPSP/Cs. A similar rank order of potency of antagonism of paired-pulse widening was observed to that for IPSP(B) inhibition. Comparison of the IC50 values for IPSP(B) inhibition and paired-pulse EPSP widening revealed a close correlation between the two effects in that their IC50s lay within the 95% confidence limits of a correlation line that described IC50 values for inhibition of paired-pulse EPSP widening that were 7.3 times higher than those for IPSP(B) inhibition. Using the compounds tested here it is not possible to assign different subtypes of GABA(B) receptor to pre- and post-synaptic loci at GABAergic synapses. However, 5-10 fold higher concentrations of antagonist are required to block presynaptic as opposed to postsynaptic receptors when these are activated by synaptically released GABA.
10398296	Postnatal development of GABAA receptor beta1, beta2/3, and gamma2 immunoreactivity in the rat retina.	GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system and plays an important role in neuronal physiology during ontogenesis. The distribution of the beta1-, beta2/3-, and gamma2-subunit of the GABAA receptor in the rat retina was studied during postnatal development using immunohistochemical methods. All subunits were found at birth. However, each subunit showed a unique staining pattern with a different local distribution. The immunoreactivity pattern changed during the time course of postnatal development for each of the proteins investigated. A clustered distribution at presumptive synaptic sites as indicated by a punctate staining pattern of the inner plexiform layer was detected as early as the second day of postnatal development. However, diffuse staining of presumptive extrasynaptic sites was found throughout development. The typical adult layering of immunoreactivity into distinctive bands appeared later in development, characteristically in the second postnatal week. The results of the present study suggest that GABAA receptor expression precedes the formation of functional synapses and changes along with cellular differentiation of the rat retina. Developmentally regulated changes in GABAA receptor composition and distribution indicate possible functions for this receptor during retinal ontogeny.
12059965	Analysis of the function of GABA(B) receptors on inhibitory afferent neurons of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex of the rat.	Purkinje cells, the output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, receive inhibitory input from basket, stellate and neighbouring Purkinje cells. The aim of the present study was to clarify the role of GABAB receptors on neurons giving inhibitory input to Purkinje cells. In sagittal slices prepared from the cerebellar vermis of the rat, the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen lowered the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) recorded in Purkinje cells. These effects were prevented by the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP 55845. Two mechanisms were involved in the depression of the inhibitory input to Purkinje cells. The first mechanism was suppression of the firing of basket, stellate and Purkinje cells. The second mechanism was presynaptic inhibition of GABA release from terminals of the afferent axons. This was indicated by the finding that baclofen decreased the amplitude of IPSCs occurring in Purkinje cells synchronously with action potentials recorded in basket cells. A further support for the presynaptic inhibition is the observation that baclofen decreased the amplitude of autoreceptor currents which are due to activation of GABAA autoreceptors at axon terminals of basket cells by synaptically released GABA. The presynaptic inhibition was partly due to direct inhibition of the vesicular release mechanism, because baclofen lowered the frequency of miniature IPSCs recorded in Purkinje cells in the presence of cadmium and in the presence of tetrodotoxin plus ionomycin. The results show that activation of GABAB receptors decreased GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic input to cerebellar Purkinje cells both by lowering the firing rate of the inhibitory input neurons and by inhibiting GABA release from their axon terminals with a presynaptic mechanism.
12368804	Site-specific fluorescence reveals distinct structural changes with GABA receptor activation and antagonism.	Neurotransmitter-operated ion channels, such as the GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor, are important in fast synaptic transmission between neurons. Using site-specific fluorescent labeling and simultaneous electrophysiological analysis in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing recombinant rho1 GABA receptors, we identified agonist-mediated molecular rearrangements at three positions within and near the agonist-binding pocket that were highly correlated with receptor activation. We also show that competitive antagonists induced distinct rearrangements on their own that stabilized the receptor in a closed state. Finally, the allosteric antagonist picrotoxin induced a global conformational change that was sensed in the subunit-subunit interface of the amino (N)-terminal domain, distant from its presumed site of action within the transmembrane domains. This first detection in real time of molecular rearrangements of a ligand-activated receptor provides insights into the structural correlates of activation, antagonism and allosteric modulation.
7494864	GABAB receptors.	GABAB receptors are a distinct subclass of receptors for the major inhibitory transmitter 4-aminobutanoic acid (GABA) that mediate depression of synaptic transmission and contribute to the inhibition controlling neuronal excitability. The development of specific agonists and antagonists for these receptors has led to a better understanding of their physiology and pharmacology, highlighting their diverse coupling to different intracellular effectors through Gi/G(o) proteins. This review emphasises our current knowledge of the neurophysiology and neurochemistry of GABAB receptors, including their heterogeneity, as well as the therapeutic potential of drugs acting at these sites.
7743171	Synaptic vesicle recycling. The Ferrari of endocytosis?	After neurotransmission, neurons internalize and recycle the membrane components of synaptic vesicles remarkably quickly; they may have a 'rebuilt, turbo-charged' endocytic engine to achieve these speeds.
7991629	Neurotrophin 3 potentiates neuronal activity and inhibits gamma-aminobutyratergic synaptic transmission in cortical neurons.	Neurotrophins have traditionally been regarded as slowly acting signals essential for neuronal survival and differentiation. However, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin 3 (NT-3) have recently been reported to exert an acute potentiation of synaptic activity at the amphibian neuromuscular junction. Little is known about the role of neurotrophins on functional synapses in the central nervous system. Here we show that NT-3 rapidly increased the frequency of spontaneous action potentials, and it synchronized excitatory synaptic activities in developing cortical neurons. Moreover, the inhibitory synaptic transmission mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) subtype A receptors was found to be reduced by NT-3. Thus, the excitatory effects of NT-3 on spontaneous action potentials were attributable to a reduction of GABAergic transmission. Our findings, together with previous reports of rapid regulation of central nervous system neurotrophin expression by neuronal activity and of the role of GABAergic transmission in cortical plasticity, suggest a mechanism for modulation of synaptic transmission and activity-dependent synaptic modulation in cortical neurons.
8727397	Spontaneous GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory currents in adult rat somatosensory cortex.	1. Spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents (sIPSCs) were studied with whole cell voltage-clamp recordings from 131 pyramidal cells in adult rat somatosensory cortical slices. Neurons were intracellulary labeled with biocytin and classified as supragranular (SG, layers 2-3), layer IV (IV), or infragranular (IG, layer V) on the basis of the laminar localization of their somata. Somatic areas were similar for SG, IV, and IG neurons. All identified pyramidal cells generated high-frequency gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor-mediated synaptic events. 2. Bath application of bicuculline blocked the sIPSCs and resulted in a decrease of approximately 0.5 nS in resting conductance and an inward shift in baseline current. 3. sIPSC frequency was significantly lower in SG versus IG or IV neurons, and this difference was accounted for by the occurrence of a higher percentage of bursts of sIPSCs in the IG and IV neurons. 4. Bath application of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic (AMPA) receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) decreased the frequency of sIPSCs by 13-21%. By contrast, application of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D-AP5) generally had no effect on spontaneous IPSC frequency, suggesting that AMPA rather than NMDA receptor activation contributed to resting discharge of inhibitory interneurons. 5. Addition of tetrodotoxin (TTX) to the perfusion medium reduced the spontaneous IPSC frequency by approximately 30-55%. The miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) seen in TTX-containing solutions had a frequency of approximately 10 Hz and an average conductance of 0.42-0.48 nS. 6. The kinetic properties of mIPSCs generated in pyramidal cells of different layers were the same, with the rise times of approximately 0.9 ms and decay time constants of approximately 8 ms at a holding potential of 0 mV. The decay phase of mIPSCs was generally fitted by one exponential and displayed a voltage dependence with an e-fold increase in decay time constant for a every 198-mV depolarization. 7. These results show that there is ongoing spontaneous release of GABA in neocortical slices that gives rise to high-frequency impulse-related and non-impulse-related postsynaptic inhibitory currents. Activation of AMPA receptors on inhibitory interneurons accounts for only a small proportion of the GABAA receptor-mediated events. Judging from the distribution of mIPSC frequencies in neurons of different laminae, there is a relatively uniform distribution of inhibitory synapses throughout the cortex. Tonic activation of GABAA receptors on neocortical pyramidal neurons generates an increase in resting membrane conductance that may play an important role in vivo by preventing the development of hyperexcitability, modulating excitatory synaptic events, and controlling the rate and patterns of spike discharge.
8846076	In vitro study of afferent synaptic transmission in the rostral gustatory zone of the rat nucleus of the solitary tract.	The synaptic responses of rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST) neurons to electrical stimulation of the solitary tract (ST) fibers were investigated using whole-cell recordings in brain slices of adult rat medulla. Most neurons of the rNST (47%) responded to stimulation of the ST with excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), 28% responded with mixed excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) and 25% responded with inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). The estimated reversal potentials for the EPSPs (EEPSP) was -7 mV and for the IPSPs (EIPSP) was -69 mV. The glutamate antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) acting at the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)/kainate receptor, either reduced or blocked all EPSPs tested. D-2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV), a selective N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, also reduced the amplitude of the EPSPs. These results suggest that glutamate is released following stimulation of afferent fibers in the ST and acts on both AMPA/kainate and NMDA glutamate receptors. The IPSPs result from release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) since superfusion of the GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline reversibly blocked the IPSPs. The GABAB receptor antagonist, phaclofen, also reduced the IPSP components in some neurons, indicating that both GABAA and GABAB receptors are involved in inhibitory transmission in the rNST. When the morphology of the recorded neurons was examined by filling the neurons with biocytin and reconstructing the neurons, each morphological type of rNST neuron responded with excitatory and inhibitory PSPs following stimulation of the ST.
8871228	GABAB receptors presynaptically modulate excitatory synaptic transmission in the rat supraoptic nucleus in vitro.	1. The effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid-B (GABAB)-receptor activation on excitatory synaptic transmission in the rat supraoptic nucleus (SON) was examined using the nystatin perforated-patch whole cell recording technique in coronal hypothalamic slices. 2. Stimulation of the hypothalamic region dorso-medial to the SON elicited glutamate and GABAA-receptor-mediated synaptic responses in electrophysiologically identified magnocellular neurosecretory cells. 3. Bath application of the GABAB-receptor agonist, +/- -baclofen reversibly reduced pharmacologically isolated, glutamate-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in a concentration-dependent manner. At the concentrations used, baclofen altered neither the postsynaptic conductances of these cells nor their response to bath applied alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA). 4. The baclofen-induced synaptic depression was accompanied by an increase in paired pulse facilitation (PPF). This increase in PPF, as well as the synaptic depression, was blocked by the GABAB-receptor antagonists CGP36742 and saclofen. 5. In addition to blocking the actions of baclofen in this nucleus, CGP36742 caused an increase in the evoked EPSC amplitude without altering postsynaptic cell conductances or responses induced by bath-applied AMPA. Contrary to the action of CGP36742, saclofen caused a baclofen-like depression of the evoked EPSC, suggesting that it may act as a partial GABAB receptor agonist. 6. These results indicate that the activation of presynaptic GABAB receptors reduces fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the SON. They further suggest that presynaptic GABAB receptors may be tonically activated in vitro. Thus GABAB receptors may influence the level of activity and excitation of SON neurons and hence modulate the secretion of the regulatory neuropeptides vasopressin and oxytocin.
8974333	Cerebral GABA receptors.	GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors in the brain have been classified into GABAA and GABAB types. The GABAA receptor is an ionotropic type that forms the GABA-gated Cl- channel. The structure of GABAA receptor has been intensively analyzed and found to consist of several subunits and the combination of these subunits is heterogeneous. Therefore, it is likely that multiple GABAA receptors are present and exert various inhibitory actions in the brain. On the other hand, the GABAB receptor, a metabotropic type, inhibits cAMP formation as well as inositol phosphates turnover. The inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity is mediated by GTP-binding protein such as Gi and/or Go which is coupled with GABAB receptor. Studies of the purified GABAB receptor obtained by baclofen-affinity and immunoaffinity column chromatographic procedures have indicated that this receptor protein is approximately 80 kDa in molecular weight and heterogeneous as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Alcohol induces the activation of GABA-gated Cl- channel but this activation is found to be diminished following the establishment of alcohol dependence. Furthermore, alcohol dependence induces the increase of GABAB receptor binding, while suppressing the functional coupling between GABAB receptor and adenylyl cyclase, possibly altering the function of Gi/Go type of GTP-binding protein which is coupled to GABAB receptor in the brain. The pathophysiological significance of these changes in the establishment of alcohol dependence and/or alcohol withdrawal syndrome is also briefly discussed.
10338288	Neurosteroid regulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission in the rat hippocampus in vitro.	The effect of the neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate on inhibitory synaptic transmission was studied in area CA1 of the rat hippocampus using an in vitro hippocampal slice preparation. Synaptic responses elicited by stimulation of Schaffer collateral fibers were recorded extracellularly as population spikes in the somatic region and as synaptic field potentials in the dendritic region. Bath application of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (10 microM) enhanced the synaptically evoked somatic population spike with no effect on the dendritic synaptic potential. Isolation of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptor-mediated component of the synaptic response by addition of antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartate and GABA receptors to the perfusion saline demonstrated that dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate had no effect on this component of the dendritic synaptic potential. In contrast, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate antagonized GABA receptor-mediated inhibitory effects in the somatic region, resulting in an augmentation of the somatic population spike amplitude. Paired-pulse facilitation was unaltered by dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, thus arguing against possible presynaptic sites of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate's actions. These results indicate that dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate can alter synaptic transmission in the hippocampus through selective postsynaptic actions on inhibitory synaptic transmission. A synaptic effect of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate is consistent with a neuromodulatory role for this neurosteroid in the central nervous system, and may contribute to the reported effects of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate on cognitive processes such as learning and memory.
10762309	GABAB receptors mediate frequency-dependent depression of excitatory potentials in rat perirhinal cortex in vitro.	Excitatory synaptic transmission in the perirhinal cortex exhibits marked homosynaptic paired pulse depression (PPD) at inter-pulse intervals between 100 and 1000 ms, being maximal at 200 ms. Additionally, there is greater PPD with stimulation of the pathway from the temporal cortex side than with stimulation of the pathway from the entorhinal cortex side. We establish that this frequency-dependent depression relies on the activation of GABAB (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors. PPD in both temporal and entorhinal pathways is abolished by either of the selective GABAB receptor antagonists, 3-N[1-(S)-(3, 4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]amino-2-(S)-hydroxypropyl-p-benzyl-phosphinic acid (CGP55845A) or 3-amino-propyl(diethoxymethyl)phosphinic acid (CGP35348). Barium which blocks G-protein-coupled, inwardly rectifying potassium channels, does not block PPD. Heterosynaptic depression mediated by GABAB receptors was also observed. The depression of the entorhinal pathway by stimulation of the temporal pathway is greater than depression of the temporal pathway by stimulation of the entorhinal pathway. Moreover, PPD increases with stimulus strength and the depression is enhanced by short trains of stimuli, consistent with stronger stimulation resulting in more GABA reaching GABAB receptors on excitatory glutamatergic synapses. Synaptic activation of GABAB receptors may be important in regulating excitability in a frequency-dependent manner with maximal depression occurring at approximately 5 Hz, which approximates to the theta rhythm. That homosynaptic and heterosynaptic depression by stimulation of the temporal pathway is greater than by stimulation of the entorhinal pathway suggests that activation of temporal feedforward connections to the perirhinal cortex can dominate the GABAergic control of synaptic activity within the perirhinal cortex.
12081656	Expression and distribution of metabotropic GABA receptor subtypes GABABR1 and GABABR2 during rat neocortical development.	To understand the possible contribution of metabotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABABR) in cortical development, we investigated the expression pattern and the cellular and subcellular localization of the GABABR1 and GABABR2 subtypes in the rat neocortex from embryonic day 14 (E14) to adulthood. At the light microscopic level, both GABABR1 and GABABR2 were detected as early as E14. During prenatal development, both subtypes were expressed highly in the cortical plate. Using double immunofluorescence, GABABR1 colocalized with GABABR2 in neurons of the marginal zone and subplate, indicating that these proteins are coexpressed and could be forming functional GABABRs during prenatal development in vivo. In contrast, only GABABR1 but not GABABR2 was detected in the tangentially migratory cells in the lower intermediate zone. During postnatal development, immunoreactivity for GABABR1 and GABABR2 was distributed mainly in pyramidal cells. Discrete GABABR1-immunopositive cell bodies of interneurons were present throughout the neocortex. In addition, GABABR1 but not GABABR2 was found in identified Cajal-Retzius cells in layer I. At the electron microscopic level, immunoreactivity for GABABR1 and GABABR2 was found in dendritic spines and dendritic shafts at extrasynaptic and perisynaptic sites throughout postnatal development. We further demonstrated the presynaptic localization of GABABR1 and GABABR2, as well as the association of the receptors with asymmetrical synaptic junctions. These results indicate potentially important roles for the GABABRs in the regulation of migratory processes during corticogenesis and in the modulation of synaptic transmission during early development of cortical circuitry.
12367619	Furosemide reveals heterogeneous GABA(A) receptor expression at adult rat Golgi cell to granule cell synapses.	The contribution that alpha6 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors make to inhibitory synaptic transmission to granule cells was investigated by making whole-cell patch clamp recordings from granule cells in adult rat cerebellar slices and applying furosemide, the specific alpha6 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptor antagonist. Endogenous, extracellular GABA continually activated GABA(A) receptors producing a tonic current. Since this current was markedly reduced by furosemide it was probably produced by alpha6 subunit-containing receptors. In contrast, furosemide had little effect on the amplitude or kinetics of fast spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs), although such sIPSCs were abolished by bicuculline and SR95331. However, the amplitude of evoked IPSCs with a very slow rise and decay were markedly reduced by furosemide. These IPSCs probably resulted from the spillover of GABA from neighbouring synapses activating high affinity alpha6 subunit-containing receptors. In the rest of the cells (40 out of 46), evoked IPSCs had rise and decay kinetics that lay in-between fast sIPSCs and slow 'spillover' IPSCs. Such IPSCs had variable kinetics and also exhibited considerable variation in the magnitude of furosemide block. Thus the GABA(A) receptors present at adult Golgi cell-granule cell synapses, at a developmental stage where receptor expression is complete, are highly heterogeneous.
12827191	Alpha-neurexins couple Ca2+ channels to synaptic vesicle exocytosis.	Synapses are specialized intercellular junctions in which cell adhesion molecules connect the presynaptic machinery for neurotransmitter release to the postsynaptic machinery for receptor signalling. Neurotransmitter release requires the presynaptic co-assembly of Ca2+ channels with the secretory apparatus, but little is known about how synaptic components are organized. Alpha-neurexins, a family of >1,000 presynaptic cell-surface proteins encoded by three genes, link the pre- and postsynaptic compartments of synapses by binding extracellularly to postsynaptic cell adhesion molecules and intracellularly to presynaptic PDZ domain proteins. Using triple-knockout mice, we show that alpha-neurexins are not required for synapse formation, but are essential for Ca2+-triggered neurotransmitter release. Neurotransmitter release is impaired because synaptic Ca2+ channel function is markedly reduced, although the number of cell-surface Ca2+ channels appears normal. These data suggest that alpha-neurexins organize presynaptic terminals by functionally coupling Ca2+ channels to the presynaptic machinery.
12838869	[Expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor gamma 1 subunit in the end-organs of rat vestibule].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor gamma 1 subunit in the end-organs of rat vestibule. METHOD: Using a combination of reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction, expression of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor gamma 1 subunit in the end-organs of rat vestibule was examined. The rat brain RNA was used as positive control. RESULT: PCR amplification products representing subunit gene expression for gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor alpha 1 subunit were amplified. CONCLUSION: The results showed that gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor gamma 1 subunit was expressed in the rat vestibule, indicating that GABA is one of the important neurotransmitters in the vestibular system.
14556004	TRAM is specifically involved in the Toll-like receptor 4-mediated MyD88-independent signaling pathway.	Recognition of pathogens by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) triggers innate immune responses through signaling pathways mediated by Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptors such as MyD88, TIRAP and TRIF. MyD88 is a common adaptor that is essential for proinflammatory cytokine production, whereas TRIF mediates the MyD88-independent pathway from TLR3 and TLR4. Here we have identified a fourth TIR domain-containing adaptor, TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM), and analyzed its physiological function by gene targeting. TRAM-deficient mice showed defects in cytokine production in response to the TLR4 ligand, but not to other TLR ligands. TLR4- but not TLR3-mediated MyD88-independent interferon-beta production and activation of signaling cascades were abolished in TRAM-deficient cells. Thus, TRAM provides specificity for the MyD88-independent component of TLR4 signaling.
7562607	GABAB receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition in guinea-pig hippocampus is caused by reduction of presynaptic Ca2+ influx.	1. The hypothesis that activation of GABAB receptors inhibits evoked synaptic transmission by reducing the presynaptic Ca2+ influx was tested using a recently developed technique for simultaneously recording the presynaptic Ca2+ transient ([Ca2+]t) and the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) evoked by a single electrical stimulus at CA3 to CA1 synapses of guinea-pig hippocampus. 2. The GABAB receptor agonist baclofen reversibly blocked, in a dose-dependant manner, both the fEPSP and the presynaptic [Ca2+]t with similar time courses. During application of baclofen, the fEPSP was proportional to about the fourth power of the presynaptic [Ca2+]t, and the presynaptic fibre volley and the resting Ca2+ level did not change. These results are similar to those we previously observed following application of several voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blockers, suggesting that baclofen inhibits the fEPSP by blocking the presynaptic Ca2+ influx. 3. The inhibition by baclofen of both the fEPSP and the presynaptic [Ca2+]t was blocked by the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP 35348, consistent with the causal relationship between the GABAB receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition of the [Ca2+]t and the fEPSP. 4. The inhibition by baclofen of the [Ca2+]t was partially occluded by application of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blocker omega-conotoxin-GVIA (omega-CgTX-GVIA), but not omega-agatoxin-IVA (omega-AgaTX-IVA), suggesting that baclofen reduces the presynaptic [Ca2+]t by blocking Ca2+ channels including the omega-CgTX-GVIA-sensitive type. 5. We conclude that baclofen inhibits evoked transmitter release by reducing presynaptic Ca2+ influx.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
8012282	Interferon-beta endogenously produced by intratumoral injection of cationic liposome-encapsulated gene: cytocidal effect on glioma transplanted into nude mouse brain.	The cytocidal effect of endogenously produced human interferon-beta was tested on glioma transplanted into the brain of nude mice by intracranial injection of a cell suspension of human glioma cell line U251-SP. When plasmid pSV2IFN-beta, bearing the human interferon-beta gene, was encapsulated into cationic multilamellar liposomes composed of N-(alpha-trimethylammonioacetyl)-didodecyl-D-glutamate chloride, dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine, and dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine in a molar ratio of 1:2:2 and injected intratumorally, human interferon-beta was produced in the tumor. The tumor completely disappeared if the injection was done shortly after the transplantation. Even when the tumor did not disappear, survival of the tumor-bearing nude mice was markedly prolonged. In control experiments made with normal brain having no glioma, interferon-beta was not detected.
8917576	Gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor-dependent burst-firing in thalamic neurons: a dynamic clamp study.	Synchronized network responses in thalamus depend on phasic inhibition originating in the thalamic reticular nucleus (nRt) and are mediated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). A suggested role for intra-nRt connectivity in inhibitory phasing remains controversial. Recently, functional GABA type B (GABAB) receptors were demonstrated on nRt cells, and the slow time course of the GABAB synaptic response seems ideally suited to deinactivate low-threshold calcium channels. This promotes burst firing, a characteristic feature of synchronized responses. Here we investigate GABAB-mediated rebound burst firing in thalamic cells. Whole-cell current-clamp recordings were obtained from nRt cells and somatosensory thalamocortical relay cells in rat brain slices. Synthetic GABAB inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, generated by a hybrid computerneuron synapse (dynamic clamp), triggered rebound low-threshold calcium spikes in both cell types when peak inhibitory postsynaptic potential hyperpolarization was greater than -92 mV. The threshold inhibitory postsynaptic potential conductance for rebound burst generation was comparable in nRt (7 nS) and thalamocortical (5 nS) cells. However, burst onset in nRt (1 s) was considerably delayed compared with thalamocortical (0.6 s) cells. Thus, GABAB inhibitory postsynaptic potentials can elicit low-threshold calcium spikes in both relay and nRt neurons, but the resultant oscillation frequency would be faster for thalamocortical-nRt networks (3 Hz) than for nRt-nRt networks (1-2 Hz). We conclude, therefore, that fast (> 2 Hz) GABAB-dependent thalamic oscillations are maintained primarily by reciprocal connections between excitatory and inhibitory cells. These findings further indicate that when oscillatory neural networks contain both recurrent and reciprocal inhibition, then distinct population frequencies may result when one or the other type of inhibition is favored.
9744963	GABAB receptor-mediated modulation of presynaptic currents and excitatory transmission at a fast central synapse.	Large nerve terminals (calyces of Held) in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) offer a unique opportunity to explore the modulation of presynaptic channels at a mammalian central synapse. In this study I examined gamma-aminobutyric acid-B (GABAB)-mediated presynaptic inhibition at the calyx of Held in slices of the rat auditory brain stem. The selective GABAB agonist baclofen caused a potent inhibition of synaptic transmission and presynaptic Ca2+ current. The inhibition of presynaptic Ca2+ channels was associated with a slowing of the activation kinetics of the underlying current, and the inhibition was relieved by strong depolarization. The inhibition of both synaptic transmission and presynaptic Ca2+ current was abolished by N-ethylmaleimide, a sulfhydryl alkylating agent that uncouples the G(o)/Gi class of G proteins from receptors. Baclofen does not activate a potassium conductance in the presynaptic terminal. Taken together, these results suggest that GABAB receptors inhibit synaptic transmission via G protein-mediated modulation of presynaptic Ca2+ channels at this large central synapse. Furthermore, these findings demonstrate that basic mechanisms of G protein-mediated inhibition of Ca2+ channels, proposed from recordings of neuron cell bodies, are well conserved at nerve endings in the mammalian brain.
9769665	[Gamma aminobutyric acid--its function, disorders and their sequelae].	Gama-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an important neurotransmitter that mediates inhibition in the central nervous system. Approximately 30-50% of all synapses are defined as GABA-ergic. GABA is a neurotransmitter in cortical and hippocampal interneurones. GABA-RECEPTORS: Till today, three receptor subtypes have been known: GABAA, GABAB and GABAC, which are pharmacologically different. GABAA receptor is postsynaptic and localized in central and peripheral sympathetic neurones. Its agonist is muscimol and is antagonized by bicucculline. GABAB is a presynaptic receptor of vegetative and central nerve terminals. Its agonist is baclofen. The main difference between these two subtypes is that the first one acts directly on Cl ionphore, while GABAB activity is mediated by Gi protein. GABAC receptors are the integral part of the membrane, which stabilise the resting potential of the cell by increasing conductivity for Cl. Their most effective agonist is TACA. GABA ACTIVITY ON SYNAPSES: GABA is the most powerful inhibitory neurotransmitter in CNS. Synaptic inhibition decreases cell's ability to communicate with other cells and it is realised by various inhibitory mechanism of GABA, such as preventing of stimuluss generation, dendritic inhibition and dendro-dendritic inhibition. GABA AND NEUROENDOCRINE REGULATION: Besides physiological significance in maintaining regular excitation and inhibition balance. GABA plays an important role in neuroendocrine regulation of the following hormones: LH, FSH, PRL, STH, SS, ACTH, TSH, TRH, MSH, VP and OX. GABA IN NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES: Increasing or decreasing of GABA-ergic tone, due to different reasons, may lead to numerous neurodegenerative disorders (epilepsy, hepatic encephalopathy, Huntington's chorea, spinocerebellar degeneration, dementia and psychosis).
9929643	Ionic mechanism of GABAA biphasic synaptic potentials in gustatory nucleus of the solitary tract.	Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the principal neurotransmitter of synaptic inhibition in the gustatory nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST). High-frequency activation of GABA neurons in the rNST results in biphasic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) that are initially hyperpolarizing but then became depolarizing. Our results indicate that high-frequency stimulation evokes redistribution of Cl- and K+ ions that shifts IPSP reversal potential in a more positive direction, which produces a biphasic or depolarizing IPSP.
10064815	Mu opioids enhance mossy fiber synaptic transmission indirectly by reducing GABAB receptor activation.	The cellular mechanisms underlying mu opioid facilitation of mossy fiber (MF) long-term potentiation (LTP) and synaptic transmission were investigated in the rat hippocampal slice. Naloxone (10 microM) significantly inhibited the induction of mossy fiber LTP, an effect attributed by Derrick and Martinez [B.E. Derrick, J.L.J. Martinez, Opioid receptor activation is one factor underlying the frequency dependence of mossy fiber LTP induction, J. Neurosci. 14 (1994) 4359-4367] to antagonism of endogenous opioid peptide action. We found that the inhibitory effects of naloxone were not blocked by bicuculline, suggesting that endogenous opioids did not enhance mossy fiber LTP by depressing GABAA inhibition. [d-Ala2, NMePhe4, Glyol5] enkephalin, DAMGO (300 nM), a mu opioid agonist, mimicked the action of endogenous opioids, enhancing both mossy fiber LTP induction and paired-pulse facilitation. DAMGO potentiation of the paired-pulse facilitation of mossy fiber response was also insensitive to bicuculline but was blocked by the mu selective antagonist CTOP. Further analysis of the cellular mechanism showed that the depletion of internal Ca2+ stores by thapsigargin (1 microM), or inhibition of protein kinases by application of staurosporine (1 microM) did not block the DAMGO facilitation of mossy fiber-CA3 synaptic transmission. However, application of phaclofen (100 microM GABAB receptor antagonist or SCH 50911, a more potent GABAB antagonist significantly inhibited the DAMGO effect (49+/-15%; 51+/-19% inhibition, P<0.05). The data indicate that the DAMGO effect on the mossy fiber pathway is partially mediated by a reduction in GABA activation of GABAB receptors. These findings further suggest that endogenous opioid peptides activate mu opioid receptors to facilitate mossy fiber LTP and synaptic transmission in rat hippocampus partially by GABAB receptor-mediated disinhibitory mechanism.
10575119	The commissure of probst as a source of GABAergic inhibition.	Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from neurons in the rat's dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (DNLL) in a brain slice preparation. Planes of section were chosen to preserve the integrity of fibers in the commissure of Probst (CP) and postsynaptic responses were evoked by electrical stimulation along its length. Results showed that the crossed projection to the DNLL through the CP is mainly, if not exclusively, inhibitory in the rat. Inhibitory postsynaptic responses (IPSPs) evoked by stimulation of the CP were blocked by the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline, but were unaffected by the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine, supporting the conclusion that the crossed inhibitory projection to DNLL from the contralateral DNLL is GABAergic. Stimulation of the CP close to the DNLL frequently evoked excitatory postsynaptic responses as well as IPSPs, but stimulation near the midline evoked IPSPs only. Thus, the excitatory responses probably originated from a pathway other than the projection to the DNLL from the contralateral DNLL through the CP.
10774734	GABA spillover activates postsynaptic GABA(B) receptors to control rhythmic hippocampal activity.	In the hippocampus, interneurons provide synaptic inhibition via the transmitter GABA, which can activate GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors (GABA(A)Rs and GABA(B)Rs). Generally, however, GABA released by a single interneuron activates only GABA(A)Rs on its targets, despite the abundance of GABA(B)RS. Here, I show that during hippocampal rhythmic activity, simultaneous release of GABA from several interneurons activates postsynaptic GABA(B)Rs and that block of GABA(B)Rs increases oscillation frequency. Furthermore, if GABA uptake is inhibited, even GABA released by a single interneuron is enough to activate GABA(B)Rs. This occurs also on cells not directly contacted by that interneuron, indicating that GABA has to overcome uptake and exit the synaptic cleft to reach GABA(B)RS. Thus, activation of extrasynaptic GABA(B)Rs by pooling of GABA is an important mechanism regulating hippocampal network activity.
10938255	Relative magnitude of tonic and phasic synaptic excitation of medullary inspiratory neurons in dogs.	The relative contribution of phasic and tonic excitatory synaptic drives to the augmenting discharge patterns of inspiratory (I) neurons within the ventral respiratory group (VRG) was studied in anesthetized, ventilated, paralyzed, and vagotomized dogs. Multibarrel micropipettes were used to record simultaneously single-unit neuronal activity and pressure microejected antagonists of GABAergic, glycinergic, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA glutamatergic, and cholinergic receptors. The discharge patterns were quantified via cycle-trigger histograms. The findings suggest that two-thirds of the excitatory drive to caudal VRG I neurons is tonic and mediated by NMDA receptors and the other third is ramp-like phasic and mediated by non-NMDA receptors. Cholinergic receptors do not appear to be involved. The silent expiratory phase is produced by phasic inhibition of the tonic activity, and approximately 80% of this inhibition is mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABA(A)) and approximately 20% by glycine receptors. Phasic I inhibition by the I decrementing neurons does not appear to contribute to the predominantly step-ramp patterns of these I neurons. However, this decrementing inhibition may be very prominent in controlling the rate of augmentation in late-onset I neurons and those with ramp patterns lacking the step component.
12130700	Dopamine modulates the function of group II and group III metabotropic glutamate receptors in the substantia nigra pars reticulata.	Recent findings have shown that dendritically released dopamine (DA) plays an important modulatory role in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). It is therefore possible that the loss of DA observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) could hold important consequences for nigral function. Previously, we have shown that activation of presynaptically localized group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) inhibits excitatory transmission at the subthalamic nucleus (STN)-SNr synapse and that activation of presynaptically localized group III mGluRs decreases excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the SNr. To test the hypothesis that nigral DA can modulate mGluR function in the SNr, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from gamma-aminobutyric acidergic SNr neurons in slices obtained from rats that were acutely reserpinized. In slices obtained from reserpinized animals, the effect of group II mGluR activation by the selective agonist (+)-2-aminobicyclo[3.1.0]-hexane-2,6-dicarboxylate monohydrate (LY354740) (100 nM), but not group III mGluR activation [L-(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid, L-AP4, 500 microM], at STN-SNr synapses is significantly decreased. This effect could be mimicked in control slices by prior bath application of haloperidol (20 microM) and R-(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine (SCH23390) (20 microM) but not sulpiride (50 microM). Furthermore, application of dopamine (100 microM) and (+/-)-6-chloro-7,8-dyhydroxy-3allyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetra-hydro-1H-benzazepine (SKF82958) (1 microM) but not quinpirole (10 microM) could rescue the group II mGluR effect in reserpinized slices. The effect of group III mGluR activation (L-AP4, 100 microM) on inhibitory synaptic transmission was also significantly reduced in slices from reserpine-treated animals. This effect was mimicked by haloperidol (20 microM), SCH23390 (20 microM), and sulpiride (50 microM) in control slices. Thus, in a Parkinsonian state, the loss of nigral DA may add to the overall pathophysiological changes in basal ganglia output.
12358754	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II phosphorylation of the GABAA receptor alpha1 subunit modulates benzodiazepine binding.	gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the primary neurotransmitter that is responsible for the fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. A major post-translational mechanism that can rapidly regulate GABAAR function is receptor phosphorylation. This study was designed to test the effect of endogenous calcium and calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaM kinase II) activation on both allosteric modulator binding and GABAA receptor subunit phosphorylation. Endogenous CaM kinase II activity was stimulated, and GABAA receptors were subsequently analyzed for bothallosteric modulator binding properties and immunoprecipitated and analyzed for subunit phosphorylation levels. A significant increase in allosteric-modulator binding of the GABAAR was observed under conditions maximal for CaM kinase II activation. In addition, CaM kinase II activation resulted in a direct increase in phosphorylation of the GABAA receptor alpha1 subunit. The data suggest that the CaM kinase II-dependent phosphorylation of the GABAA receptor alpha1 subunit modulated allosteric modulator binding to the GABAA receptor.
7754689	[The activation of GABA-B receptors, the decrease in intracellular Ca++ concentration and the inhibition of protein kinases--the possible mechanisms of prolonged posttetanic modification in the efficiency of inhibitory transmission in the neocortex].	We suggest hypothetical mechanisms of posttetanic potentiation of inhibitory synaptic transmission (LTPi). Our previous results allow us to suppose that modifiable synapses are located on dendritic spines where metabotropic GABAb receptors (GABAbR) have been found. We assume that GABAbR may be involved in LTPi. Their activation leads to inactivation of protein kinases C and A (PKC and PKA) due to intracellular Ca++ decrease and inhibition of cAMP. This hypothesis is confirmed by the experiments in which LTP-like phenomena for early and late cortical IPSPs were shown to be the result of inactivation of PKA and PKC. We assume that metabolites of arachidonic acid 5- and 12-HPETE can be considered as retrograde messengers for LTPi. New hypothetical mechanisms underlying posttetanic homosynaptic long-term depression of excitatory synaptic transmission (LTDe) is also proposed. According to this hypothesis the target cell must be excited monosynaptically and inhibited disynaptically by the same tetanized afferents. LTDe may be induced only in those pathways which activate postsynaptic GABAb receptors. Both hypotheses are confirmed by experimental data and allow to explain some surprising experimental results.
7906056	Cysteine string proteins: a potential link between synaptic vesicles and presynaptic Ca2+ channels.	Presynaptic calcium channels are key regulators of neurotransmitter release. Oocyte expression studies suggest that cysteine string proteins are essential subunits or modulators of these channels. Subcellular fractionation revealed that cysteine string proteins copurify with synaptic vesicles. An average vesicle had eight protein monomers with both the amino and carboxyl termini detected on the cytoplasmic face. Thus, docked synaptic vesicles may regulate presynaptic calcium channels and neurotransmitter release.
7907138	A novel GABA receptor modulates synaptic transmission from bipolar to ganglion and amacrine cells in the tiger salamander retina.	We investigated the mechanisms underlying the modulation of transmitter release from bipolar cells. Three currents, measured under whole-cell patch clamp in the tiger salamander retinal slice, were used to identify the sites of modulation and to establish their pharmacological profile. (1) A light-elicited inhibitory current was measured in bipolar cells that could be blocked by picrotoxin. This input probably arrives via GABAergic amacrine cells since there is high GABA sensitivity at the bipolar cell terminals and little GABA sensitivity at the dendrites. (2) Voltage-gated barium currents were elicited by depolarizing voltage ramps in bipolar cells. These currents most likely flowed through the calcium channels that are associated with transmitter release at the bipolar terminal. Bath-applied GABA suppressed the barium currents. (3) Puffs of potassium at bipolar dendrites depolarized bipolar cells and elicited an excitatory synaptic current measured in amacrine and ganglion cells. The excitatory synaptic currents, which reflect bipolar cell transmitter release, were also blocked by bath-applied GABA. For all three currents, the effects of GABA could be reversed by picrotoxin, but not by bicuculline or SR95531. The pharmacological profile of the receptors mediating GABA suppression of the barium currents and of excitatory synaptic transmission is characteristic of GABAC receptors (Cutting et al., 1991; Polenzani et al., 1991; Shimada et al., 1992). GABA receptors at bipolar terminals gate a chloride conductance, and most were found to have the pharmacological properties of GABAC receptors (Lukasiewicz et al., 1994). By contrast, the GABA receptors on ganglion cells have been found to be the GABAA subtype (Lukasiewicz and Werblin, 1990; Lukasiewicz et al., 1994). These results suggest that GABA acts presynaptically at GABAC receptors at the bipolar cell terminals. The GABAC receptors open chloride channels that can modulate the release of excitatory transmitter. In some experiments, bicuculline or SR95531 reversed a component of the GABA suppression of synaptic transmission. This indicates that GABAA receptors may also play a role in modulating transmission between bipolar and ganglion cells.
7910202	Omega-conotoxin sensitivity and presynaptic inhibition of glutamatergic sensory neurotransmission in vitro.	Synaptic transmission between embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and spinal cord neurons was studied in dissociated cell culture. Stimulation of DRG neurons evoked monosynaptic and polysynaptic excitatory responses in the spinal neurons. These responses could be reversibly blocked by application of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (a selective non-NMDA receptor antagonist) and irreversibly eliminated through the presynaptic action of omega-conotoxin GVIA (a selective N-type calcium channel antagonist). As N-type calcium channels in DRG neuron somata are targets for modulation via GABAB receptors, we tested the role of these receptors as regulators of synaptic transmission. Baclofen (a selective GABAB receptor agonist) reversibly inhibited synaptic transmission via a presynaptic, pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism; CGP 35348 (a selective GABAB receptor antagonist) blocked the actions of baclofen. Taken together, these results demonstrate that N-type calcium channels play a dominant role in glutamatergic sensory neurotransmission. They suggest, in addition, that modulation of N-channel activity may underlie, at least in part, presynaptic inhibition of synaptic transmission between DRG neurons and their targets in the intact spinal cord.
8532848	A physiological role for GABAB receptors and the effects of baclofen in the mammalian central nervous system.	The inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA acts in the mammalian brain through two different receptor classes: GABAA and GABAB receptors. GABAB receptors differ fundamentally from GABAA receptors in that they require a G-protein. GABAB receptors are located pre- and/or post-synaptically, and are coupled to various K+ and Ca2+ channels presumably through both a membrane delimited pathway and a pathway involving second messengers. Baclofen, a selective GABAB receptor agonist, as well as GABA itself have pre- and post-synaptic effects. Pre-synaptic effects comprise the reduction of the release of excitatory and inhibitory transmitters. GABAergic receptors on GABAergic terminals may regulate GABA release, however, in most instances spontaneous inhibitory synaptic activity is not modulated by endogenous GABA. Post-synaptic GABAB receptor-mediated inhibition is likely to occur through a membrane delimited pathway activating K+ channels, while baclofen, in some neurons, may activate K+ channels through a second messenger pathway involving arachidonic acid. Some, but not all GABAB receptor-gated K+ channels have the typical properties of those G-protein-activated K+ channels which are also gated by other endogenous ligands of the brain. New, high affinity GABAB antagonists are now available, and some pharmacological evidence points to a receptor heterogeneity. The pharmacological distinction of receptor subtypes, however, has to await final support from a characterization of the molecular structure. The function importance of post-synaptic GABAB receptors is highlighted by a segregation of GABAA and GABAB synapses in the mammalian brain.
8592185	GABAA and GABAC receptors on hybrid bass retinal bipolar cells.	1. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses from solitory hybrid bass retinal bipolar cells were studied with the use of conventional and perforated whole cell patch-clamp recording. 2. GABA elicited a chloride current in bipolar cells that had both transient and sustained components. The transient component was sensitive to bicuculline and resembled GABAA-mediated currents, whereas the more sustained component was resistant to bicuculline and resembled the responses mediated by GABAC receptors. 3. The bicuculline-resistant GABA responses recorded from the bipolar cells could not be modulated by either diazepam or pentobarbital sodium, and they were unaffected by phaclofen and 2-hydroxysaclofen, GABAB receptor antagonists. On the other hand, the bicuculline-resistant GABA responses could be blocked substantially by imidazole-4-acetic acid (I4AA), a competitive antagonist of GABAC receptors. 4. Noise analysis of the GABA-elicited currents suggested a different single channel conductance for GABAA (10.1 pS) and GABAC receptors (3.6 pS). 5. Zinc, a putative modulator of synaptic transmission, strongly inhibited the GABAC responses on bipolar cells, whereas the GABAA responses were not significantly affected by zinc. 6. The proportion of the GABAC to GABAA responses varied widely between bipolar cells. Local application of GABA onto dendrites or axon terminals showed that both types of GABA receptors are present on both regions of the cell. 7. The distinct properties of these two GABA receptor types suggest that they play different roles in retinal function.
9003241	beta-Interferon regulates the immunomodulatory activity of neonatal rodent microglia.	beta-interferon (beta-IFN) has both pro and anti-inflammatory properties, the balance of which leads to some suppression of disease activity in multiple sclerosis patients. Here, we examine the immunomodulation of neonatal rodent microglia, the principal CNS accessory cell, by beta-IFN and consider the interaction of beta-IFN and gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN). beta-IFN and gamma-IFN inhibit microglial proliferation. beta-IFN antagonises both gamma-IFN-induced upregulation of class II expression and the ability of gamma-IFN primed cells to mount a respiratory burst. In contrast, beta-IFN upregulates microglial Fc receptor expression and augments tumour necrosis factor alpha secretion from suboptimally stimulated microglia.
10195216	Synaptic corelease of ATP and GABA in cultured spinal neurons.	In the spinal dorsal horn (DH), transmission and modulation of peripheral nociceptive (pain-inducing) messages involve classical neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. We show that approximately half of DH neurons use ATP as a fast excitatory neurotransmitter acting at ionotropic P2X postsynaptic receptors. ATP was not codetected with glutamate but was coreleased with the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Moreover, adenosine, probably generated by extracellular metabolism of ATP, finely tuned GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Differential modulation of excitatory versus inhibitory components of this mixed cotransmission may help to explain changes in sensory message processing in the DH during mechanical hyperalgesia and neuropathic pain.
10536021	Attenuated sensitivity to neuroactive steroids in gamma-aminobutyrate type A receptor delta subunit knockout mice.	gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors mediate fast inhibitory synaptic transmission and have been implicated in responses to sedative/hypnotic agents (including neuroactive steroids), anxiety, and learning and memory. Using gene targeting technology, we generated a strain of mice deficient in the delta subunit of the GABA type A receptors. In vivo testing of various behavioral responses revealed a strikingly selective attenuation of responses to neuroactive steroids, but not to other modulatory drugs. Electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal slices revealed a significantly faster miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current decay time in null mice, with no change in miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current amplitude or frequency. Learning and memory assessed with fear conditioning were normal. These results begin to illuminate the novel contributions of the delta subunit to GABA pharmacology and sedative/hypnotic responses and behavior and provide insights into the physiology of neurosteroids.
10601472	Interactions between GABA and glycine at inhibitory amino acid receptors on rat olfactory bulb neurons.	Whole cell voltage-clamp electrophysiology was used to examine interactions between GABA and glycine at inhibitory amino acid receptors on rat olfactory bulb neurons in primary culture. Membrane currents evoked by GABA and glycine were selectively inhibited by low concentrations of bicuculline and strychnine, respectively, suggesting that they activate pharmacologically distinct receptors. However, GABA- and glycine-mediated currents showed cross-inhibition when the two amino acids were applied sequentially. Application of one amino acid inhibited the response to immediate subsequent application of the other. In the majority of neurons, GABA inhibited subsequent glycine-evoked currents and glycine inhibited subsequent GABA-evoked currents. In a small proportion of neurons, however, GABA inhibited glycine-evoked currents but glycine had little effect on GABA-evoked currents. The reverse was true in other neurons, suggesting that alterations in chloride gradients alone did not account for the cross-inhibition. Furthermore, no cross-inhibition was observed between GABA- and glycine-evoked currents in some neurons. The amplitude of the current evoked by the coapplication of saturating concentrations of GABA and glycine in these neurons was nearly the sum of the currents evoked by GABA and glycine alone. In contrast, the currents were not additive in neurons demonstrating cross-inhibition. These results suggest that olfactory bulb neurons heterogeneously express a population of inhibitory amino acid receptors that can bind either GABA or glycine. Interactions between GABA and glycine at inhibitory amino acid receptors may provide a mechanism to modulate inhibitory synaptic transmission.
12548707	Opposite effects of alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation on both glutamate- and gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated spontaneous transmission in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.	The effects of adrenergic receptor stimulation on spontaneous synaptic transmission were investigated in cultured rat hippocampal neurons by recording spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC and sIPSC). Noradrenaline (NA) inhibited sEPSC in a concentration-dependent manner, with maximal effect at 10 microM. The alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-selective agonists cirazoline and clonidine induced an inhibition of sEPSC appearance, whereas the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol elicited an increase. The inhibitory effect of NA was reversed by alpha(1)-adrenoceptor blockade. The participation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(B)-receptor stimulation in the inhibitory effect of NA was further examined. GABA(B)-receptor stimulation with baclofen induced a strong inhibition of bursting activity, which was fully reversed by the GABA(B) antagonist CGP 55845. By itself, CGP 55845 exerted a stimulatory effect on sEPSC frequency. In the presence of CGP 55845, the inhibitory effects of cirazoline and clonidine were maintained. NA (1, 10, and 100 microM) and alpha-adrenoceptor agonists decreased miniature EPSC and IPSC occurrence, whereas beta-adrenergic stimulation increased it. In 50% of the cells examined, NA (1, 10 microM) had a stimulatory effect on sIPSC, whereas, in the remaining 50% of cells, NA (1, 10 microM) had an inhibitory effect. In all the cells, 100 microM NA induced an inhibition of sIPSC. The inhibitory effect of NA was due to alpha(1)-receptor stimulation, whereas the excitatory effect was due to beta-receptor stimulation. In cultured hippocampal neurons, spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmissions are both similarly altered by adrenoceptor stimulation. However, in a subset of cells, low concentrations of NA mediate an increase of sIPSC via beta-adrenoceptor activation.
12752776	Modulation of GABAergic transmission by endogenous glutamate in the rat supraoptic nucleus.	The presence of group III metabotropic glutamate receptors on GABAergic terminals in the supraoptic nucleus suggests that the level of glutamate in the extracellular space may regulate synaptic strength at inhibitory synapses. To test this hypothesis we examined the consequences of increasing ambient glutamate on GABA-mediated synaptic activity in supraoptic neurons. The concentration of the excitatory amino acid in the extracellular space was increased pharmacologically by blocking glutamate transporters. Inhibition of the astrocyte-specific GLT-1 glutamate transporter led to a reversible decrease in evoked inhibitory postsynaptic current amplitude. This modulation had a presynaptic origin as revealed by analysis of paired-pulse ratio and miniature inhibitory currents. Furthermore, blocking group III metabotropic glutamate receptors with the specific antagonist MAP4 prevented the depression of GABAergic transmission induced by glutamate transporter blockade. Thus, presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors located on inhibitory terminals in the supraoptic nucleus appear to sense changes in ambient glutamate and modify GABA release accordingly. However, it seems that such changes need to reach a certain magnitude because the discrete deficit in glutamate clearance which occurs in the supraoptic nucleus of lactating rats is not sufficient to modulate GABA-mediated transmission. These results suggest that ambient glutamate contributes to the modulation of synaptic efficacy not only at glutamatergic synapses but also at inhibitory GABAergic synapses.
8714661	Heterologous modulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission by metabotropic glutamate receptors in cultured hippocampal neurons.	1. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings of monosynaptically connected pairs of hippocampal neurons in very low-density culture were performed to determine the effects of the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) on inhibitory terminals. The mGluR agonist (1S, 3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid [(1S, 3R)-ACPD] and the recently described mGluR antagonist (RS)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG) were used. In addition, the glutamate uptake inhibitors L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (L-trans-PDC) and D,L-beta-threo-hydroxyaspartate (THA) were used to determine whether endogenous agents (presumably glutamate) could activate mGluRs at inhibitory terminals. Previous reports of the role of mGluRs on inhibitory terminals were performed in slice preparations; our use of patch-clamp recordings from isolated pairs of hippocampal neurons is uniquely useful for the study of inhibitory synaptic transmission in the absence of polysynaptic connectivity. 2. The mGluR agonist (1S, 3R)-ACPD (100 microM) reversibly decreased the amplitude of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in all pairs tested; this effect was completely blocked by coapplication of the mGluR antagonist MCPG (500 microM) with (1S, 3R)-ACPD. MCPG (500 microM) alone had no effect on IPSC amplitude. These results indicate that all inhibitory neurons in our cultures express functional mGluRs in their terminals. 3. Examination of the frequency and the distribution of amplitudes of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) provide indications of changes in the sensitivity of postsynaptic receptors and/or of changes in the process of presynaptic transmitter release. Recordings of miniature currents from hippocampal neurons cultured at very low density makes possible the analysis of mIPSCs that arise from a single input, whereas in high density or slice preparations, spontaneous miniature currents reflect numerous synaptic inputs. No change in the amplitudes or frequency of the mIPSCs were observed upon application of (1S, 3R)-ACPD (100 microM). Thus we conclude that the depression of the evoked IPSC amplitude by (1S, 3R)-ACPD is mediated by a presynaptic mechanism in these isolated pairs of hippocampal neurons. 4. The glutamate uptake inhibitor L-trans-PDC also reduced IPSC amplitude in 8 of 13 pairs. In these eight pairs, an increase in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated membrane noise indicated an increase in ambient concentrations of glutamate induced by L-trans-PDC. In the remaining five pairs, membrane noise remained unaffected by L-trans-PDC, and IPSCs were not attenuated. Similar results were observed with the use of the uptake inhibitor THA. The mGluR antagonist MCPG blocked the effects of L-trans-PDC and THA on IPSC amplitude. We propose that inhibition of glutamate uptake mechanisms results in activation of mGluRs on GABAergic terminals via endogenous sources of glutamate and that the uptake inhibitors (L-trans-PDC and THA) do not directly activate the metabotropic receptor. 5. Presynaptic receptors and active modulation of uptake mechanisms are clearly involved in a wide range of physiological and pathological synaptic events. The data presented here suggest that heterosynaptic modulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission by metabotropic glutamate receptors may be important for the maintenance and plasticity of the balances between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the CNS.
8911914	Preferential enhancement of inhibitory synaptic transmission by CS-722 in the ventral horn neurons of neonatal rat spinal cord.	We studied the modulatory effect of (R)-4-chloro-2-(2-hydroxy-3-morpholinopropyl)-5-phenyl-4-isoxaz olin-3-one hydrochloride (CS-722), a centrally acting muscle relaxant, on synaptic transmission in the ventral horn neurons of neonatal rat lumbar spinal cord in slices using whole cell recording techniques. Pharmacologically isolated excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs and IPSCs) were evoked by stimulating neighboring neurons. CS-722 preferentially enhanced IPSCs with little effects on EPSCs. Moreover, CS-722 reduced paired pulse facilitation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated IPSCs, suggesting its action on the presynaptic terminal. Preferential facilitatory effects on inhibitory synaptic transmission seem to be one of the mechanisms underlying muscle relaxation of this compound.
9108119	Mice devoid of gamma-aminobutyrate type A receptor beta3 subunit have epilepsy, cleft palate, and hypersensitive behavior.	gamma-Aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)-Rs) mediate the bulk of rapid inhibitory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The beta3 subunit is an essential component of the GABA(A)-R in many brain regions, especially during development, and is implicated in several pathophysiologic processes. We examined mice harboring a beta3 gene inactivated by gene targeting. GABA(A)-R density is approximately halved in brain of beta3-deficient mice, and GABA(A)-R function is severely impaired. Most beta3-deficient mice die as neonates; some neonatal mortality, but not all, is accompanied by cleft palate. beta3-deficient mice that survive are runted until weaning but achieve normal body size by adulthood, although with reduced life span. These mice are fertile but mothers fail to nurture offspring. Brain morphology is grossly normal, but a number of behaviors are abnormal, consistent with the widespread location of the beta3 subunit. The mice are very hyperactive and hyperresponsive to human contact and other sensory stimuli, and often run continuously in tight circles. When held by the tail, they hold all paws in like a ball, which is frequently a sign of neurological impairment. They have difficulty swimming, walking on grids, and fall off platforms and rotarods, although they do not have a jerky gait. beta3-deficient mice display frequent myoclonus and occasional epileptic seizures, documented by electroencephalographic recording. Hyperactivity, lack of coordination, and seizures are consistent with reduced presynaptic inhibition in spinal cord and impaired inhibition in higher cortical centers and/or pleiotropic developmental defects.
10072027	The effects of general anesthetics on excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in area CA1 of the rat hippocampus in vitro.	UNLABELLED: It is unclear whether general anesthetics induce enhancement of neural inhibition and/or attenuation of neural excitation. We studied the effects of pentobarbital (5 x 10(-4) mol/L), propofol (5 x 10(-4) mol/L), ketamine (10(-3) mol/L), halothane (1.5 vol%), and isoflurane (2.0 vol%) on both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in rat hippocampal slices. Excitatory or inhibitory synaptic pathways were isolated using pharmacological antagonists. Extracellular microelectrodes were used to record electrically evoked CA1 neural population spikes (PSs). In the presence of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor antagonist (bicuculline), the inhibitory actions of pentobarbital and propofol were completely antagonized, whereas those of ketamine, halothane, and isoflurane were only partially blocked. To induce the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated PS (NMDA PS), the non-NMDA and GABA(A) receptors were blocked in the absence of Mg2+. Ketamine, halothane, and isoflurane decreased the NMDA PS, and pentobarbital and propofol had no effect on the NMDA PS. The non-NMDA receptor-mediated PS (non-NMDA PS) was examined using the antagonists for the NMDA and GABA(A) receptors. Volatile, but not i.v., anesthetics reduced the non-NMDA PS. These findings indicate that pentobarbital and propofol produce inhibitory actions due to enhancement in the GABA(A) receptor; that ketamine reduces NMDA receptor-mediated responses and enhances GABA(A) receptor-mediated responses; and that halothane and isoflurane modulate GABA(A), NMDA, and non-NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. IMPLICATIONS: Volatile anesthetics modulate both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission of in vitro rat hippocampal pathways, whereas i.v. anesthetics produce more specific actions on inhibitory synaptic events. These results provide further support the idea that general anesthetics produce drug-specific and distinctive effects on different pathways in the central nervous system.
11549712	Dominant gating governing transient GABA(A) receptor activity: a first latency and Po/o analysis.	Steady-state, single-channel gating of GABA(A) receptors (GABARs ) is complex. Simpler gating may dominate when triggered by rapid GABA transients present during fast inhibitory synaptic transmission and is critical to understanding the time course of fast IPSCs. We studied the single-channel activity of expressed alpha1beta1gamma2 GABARs in outside-out patches from human embryonic kidney 293 cells triggered by rapidly applied GABA (10-2000 microm) pulses (2-300 msec). Activation was analyzed with the time to first channel opening after GABA presentation, or first latency (FL). FL distributions are monoexponential at low GABA concentrations and biexponential above 30 microm GABA. The fast rate increases supralinearly to a plateau of approximately 1100 sec(-1), the apparent activation rate. The slow rate and amplitude are insensitive to GABA concentration. The results argue that doubly liganded receptors can rapidly desensitize before opening. Gating after the first opening was quantified with analysis of open probability conditioned on the first opening (P(o/o)). P(o/o) functions are biexponential, dominated by a fast component, and insensitive to GABA concentration. This suggests that open channels convert primarily to fast but also to slow desensitized states. Furthermore, dual modes of fast desensitization may influence IPSC amplitude and thereby synaptic efficacy. The findings provided for the construction of a mathematical gating model that accounts for FL and P(o/o) functions. In addition, the model predicts the time course of macroscopic current responses thought to mimic IPSCs. The results provide new insights into dominant gating that is likely operational during fast GABAergic synaptic transmission.
12562906	Enhanced G protein-dependent modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission in the cerebellum of the Ca2+ channel-mutant mouse, tottering.	Tottering, a mouse model for absence epilepsy and cerebellar ataxia, carries a mutation in the gene encoding class A (P/Q-type) Ca2+ channels, the dominant exocytotic Ca2+ channel at most synapses in the mammalian central nervous system. Comparing tottering to wild-type mice, we have studied glutamatergic transmission between parallel fibres and Purkinje cells in cerebellar slices. Results from biochemical assays and electrical field recordings demonstrate that glutamate release from parallel fibre terminals of the tottering mouse is controlled largely by class B Ca2+ channels (N-type), in contrast to the P/Q-channels that dominate release from wild-type terminals. Since N-channels, in a variety of assays, are more effectively inhibited by G proteins than are P/Q-channels, we tested whether synaptic transmission between parallel fibres and Purkinje cells in tottering mice was more susceptible to inhibitory modulation by G protein-coupled receptors than in their wild-type counterparts. GABAB receptors and alpha2-adrenergic receptors (activated by bath application of transmitters) produced a three- to fivefold more potent inhibition of transmission in tottering than in wild-type synapses. This increased modulation is likely to be important for cerebellar transmission in vivo, since heterosynaptic depression, produced by activating GABAergic interneurones, greatly prolonged GABAB receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition in tottering as compared to wild-type slices. We propose that this enhanced modulation shifts the balance of synaptic input to Purkinje cells in favour of inhibition, reducing Purkinje cell output from the cerebellum, and may contribute to the aberrant motor phenotype that is characteristic of this mutant animal.
12761279	Long-term depression of synaptic inhibition is expressed postsynaptically in the developing auditory system.	Inhibitory transmission is critically involved in the functional maturation of neural circuits within the brain. However, the mechanisms involved in its plasticity and development remain poorly understood. At an inhibitory synapse of the developing auditory brain stem, we used whole cell recordings to determine the site of induction and expression of long-term depression (LTD), a robust activity-dependent phenomenon that decreases inhibitory synaptic gain and is postulated to underlie synapse elimination. Recordings were obtained from lateral superior olivary (LSO) neurons, and hyperpolarizing inhibitory potentials were evoked by stimulation of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Both postsynaptic glycine and GABAA receptors could independently display LTD when isolated pharmacologically. Focal application of GABA, but not glycine, on the postsynaptic LSO neuron was sufficient to induce depression of the amino acid-evoked response, or MNTB-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. This GABA-mediated depression, in the absence of MNTB stimulation, was blocked by a GABAB receptor antagonist. To assess whether a change in neurotransmitter release is associated with the LTD, the polyvalent cation, ruthenium red, was used to increase the frequency of miniature inhibitory synaptic events. Consistent with a postsynaptic locus of expression, we found that the mean amplitude of miniature events decreased after LTD with no change in their frequency of occurrence. Furthermore, there was no change in the paired-pulse ratio or release kinetics of evoked inhibitory responses. Together, these results provide direct evidence that activity-dependent LTD of inhibition has a postsynaptic locus of induction and alteration, and that GABA but not glycine plays a pivotal role.
8825201	Characterization of subtypes of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors in an Ascaris muscle preparation by binding assay and binding of PF1022A, a new anthelmintic, on the receptors.	We examined the effect of PF1022A, one of the gabergic anthelmintics newly developed in Japan, on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors using a radioligand binding technique in isolated membrane preparations of the nematode Ascaris suum. Membrane protein was prepared from the homogenate of somatic muscle cells after ultracentrifugation. In addition to the basic binding of [2,3-3H-(N)]-GABA, the radioligand [methyl-3H]-bicuculline is used to identify the GABAA receptor, whereas [butyl-4-3H]-baclofen is employed for GABAB receptor sites. The dissociation constants (Kd values) and the maximal numbers of binding sites (Bmax values) from Scatchard plotting for GABA receptors are close to those obtained in mammalian brain. PF1022A displaced in a concentration-dependent way the binding of [2,3-3H(N)]-GABA and [methyl-3H]-bicuculline as did other specific gabergic agents. In addition, PF1022A decreased the binding of [butyl-4-3H]-baclofen at a higher concentration, although this binding did not represent GABAB sites. In a comparison of the inhibition constants (Ki values) of PF1022A with those of other agents, it is conclusive that PF1022A bound with GABA receptors. A direct effect of PF1022A on GABA receptors can thus be postulated.
9161988	GABAB receptor-mediated inhibition of spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents in rat midbrain culture.	1. Tight-seal, whole-cell recording was used to study GABAB receptor-mediated inhibition of spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents in cultured rat midbrain neurones. 2. Spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were recorded in tetrodotoxin (TTX), Cd2+ and Ba2+. (R)-(-)-baclofen reduced the frequency of mIPSCs through a presynaptic mechanism. The EC50 for this effect was 7 microM. It was antagonized by the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP55845A (0.5 microM). 3. In pertussis toxin (PTX)-treated cultures, some GABAB receptor-mediated reduction of the frequency of mIPSCs persisted. In contrast, PTX treatment totally abolished inhibition of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). 4. In PTX-treated cultures, a saturating concentration of (R)-(-)-baclofen inhibited action potential-generated IPSCs but no EPSCs. 5. PTX treatment abolished the (R)-(-)-baclofen-mediated inhibition of high voltage-activated somatic Ca2+ currents and of spontaneous IPSCs depending on presynaptic Ca2+ entry. 6. We conclude that cellular mechanisms underlying GABAB receptor-mediated inhibition of mIPSCs contribute to auto-inhibition of GABA release.
9604220	Contrasting of synaptic signals by simultaneous modification of excitatory and inhibitory inputs.	"Conditions facilitating long-term contrasting of interneuronal connections were studied using a mathematical model of posttetanic Ca(2+)-dependent postsynaptic processes in pyramidal neurons of hippocampal field CA3. These studies demonstrated that modified inhibition selectively facilitates. long-term potentiation of the efficiency of one of the interneuronal connections when the presynaptic neuron discharges at a given frequency for a short time, while connections formed from the same postsynaptic cell with other presynaptic neurons undergo long-term depression. The mechanism underlying this contrasting may involve long-term depression of the efficiency of disynaptic inhibitory transmission to the rhythmically stimulated input, even when the efficiency of monosynaptic excitatory transmission at the same input is low and undergoes minimal potentiation. When the ""common"" inhibitory neuron is simultaneously activated by various presynaptic cells. heterosynaptic potentiation of inhibitory transmission can simultaneously develop at the other inputs of the postsynaptic cell, without change in the efficiency of excitatory transmission, which leads to long-term depression of the efficiency of the connections between other excitatory neurons and the postsynaptic cell."
10371465	New perspectives in the functional role of GABA(A) channel heterogeneity.	Gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) channels responsible for inhibitory synaptic transmission possess a consistent heterogeneity of structure in terms of distinct constitutive subunits. During the past 10 years, considerable progress has been made in understanding the magnitude of this large diversity. Structural requirements for clinically important drugs such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates have been elucidated, and the anatomical distribution in distinct neuronal populations and the developmental profiles of individual subunits have been elucidated with various techniques. However, the relevance of subunit heterogeneity to synaptic transmission is still largely lacking. Recently, substantial progress has been achieved in understanding the crucial role of desensitization as a molecular determinant in defining the duration and frequency responses of inhibitory synaptic transmission. This development, together with a combination of different experimental approaches, including patch-clamp recordings and ultrafast agonist applications in brain slices and mammalian cells expressing recombinant GABA(A) receptor, has begun to shed light on a possible role for subunit composition of synaptic receptors in shaping the physiological characteristics of synaptic transmission. Nowhere else in the central nervous system is the anatomical and developmental profile of GABA receptor heterogeneity as well understood as it is in the cerebellum. This review summarizes advances in the understanding of functional correlates to subunit heterogeneity in the cerebellum relevant for inhibitory synaptic function.
10581463	Synaptic localization of GABA(A) receptor subunits in the striatum of the rat.	The inhibitory amino acid gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is widely distributed in the basal ganglia. It plays a critical role in the functioning of the striatum as it is the transmitter of projection neurons and sub-populations of interneurons, as well as afferents from the globus pallidus. Some of the factors controlling GABA transmission are the type(s) of GABA receptor expressed at the site of transmission, their subunit composition, and their location in relation to GABA release sites. To address these issues, we examined the sub-cellular localization of subunits of the GABA(A) receptor in the striatum of the rat. Sections of freeze-substituted, Lowicryl-embedded striatum were immunolabelled by the post-embedding immunogold technique with antibodies specific for subunits of the GABA(A) receptor. Immunolabelling for alpha1, beta2/3, and gamma2 GABA(A) receptor subunits was primarily located at symmetrical synapses on perikarya, dendrites, and spines. Quantitative analysis of the distribution of immunolabelling for the beta2/3 subunits revealed that the majority of membrane associated immunogold particles were at synapses and that, on average for the whole population, they were evenly distributed across the synapse. Double labelling for the beta2/3 subunits and for GABA itself revealed that receptor-positive synapses were formed by at least two populations of terminals. One population (59.3%) of terminals forming receptor-positive synapses was positive for GABA, whereas the other (40.7%) had low or undetectable levels of GABA. Furthermore, the post-synaptic neurons were characterised on neurochemical and morphological grounds as both medium spiny neurons and GABA interneurons. Triple immunolabelling revealed the co-localization of alpha1, beta2/3, and gamma2 subunits at some symmetrical axodendritic synapse. It is concluded that fast GABA(A)-mediated transmission occurs primarily at symmetrical synapses within the striatum, that the populations of boutons giving rise to receptor-positive synapses are heterogeneous, and that previously reported co-existence of different subunits of the GABA(A) receptor at the cellular level also occurs at the level of individual synapses.
11277592	Cloning and tissue distribution of a novel isoform of the rat GABA(B)R1 receptor subunit.	We have identified a novel splice variant of the metabotropic GABA(B) receptor (R) subunit I, designated GABA(B)R1f, from a rat hippocampus cDNA library screen. GABA(B)R1f shares sequence homology with rat GABA(B)R1a, with the exception of an in-frame deletion of exon 4, resulting in a 21 bp deletion in the coding sequence of the N-terminal extracellular domain. In addition, GABA(B)R1f also contains a 93 bp in-frame insertion in a region of the sequence corresponding to the second extracellular loop and the fifth transmembrane domain, similar to that found in rat GABA(B)R1c. While being ubiquitously (but variably) expressed, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the GABA(B)R1f isoform to be most prevalent in peripheral vs central tissues, suggesting a potential role for this novel isoform in either the mediation of inhibitory transmission in these various tissues, or in as yet defined actions unrelated to central synaptic regulatory mechanisms attributable to GABA(B)R.
11337194	Early onset of glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic activity in the visual layers of the rodent superior colliculus.	During postnatal development, the retinocollicular pathway undergoes activity-dependent refinement, resulting in the precise retinotopic map seen in adults. Previous studies established that retinal efferents reach the mouse superior colliculus (SC) by embryonic day 16. Morphologically, synapses were found in the rat SC before birth. As part of an extended project aimed at understanding the development of synaptic transmission in the visual layers of the SC, we report here the presence of functionally active synapses immediately after birth. Circuit activity in mouse SC neurons was detected in horizontal slices of the visual layers using cell-attached voltage clamp. The spontaneous discharge of action potentials was abolished by glutamatergic blockers and facilitated by bicuculline, showing that circuit activity is based on synaptic transmission and that the action of gamma-aminobutyric acid is inhibitory. Using whole-cell voltage clamp, spontaneous glutamatergic postsynaptic currents as well as miniature GABAergic postsynaptic currents were recorded on postnatal day 1. Excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents could also be evoked by electrical stimulation. Glutamatergic postsynaptic currents comprised both (S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated components. The early function of glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission in the visual layers of SC suggests that SC neurons are able to process information originating from retinal axons immediately after birth.
12115687	GABABR1 receptor protein expression in human mesial temporal cortex: changes in temporal lobe epilepsy.	Immunocytochemistry was used to examine gamma-aminobutyric acid beta (GABA)(B)R1a-b protein expression in the human hippocampal formation (including dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper, subicular complex, and entorhinal cortex) and perirhinal cortex. Overall, GABA(B)R1a-b immunostaining was intense and widespread but showed differential areal and laminar distributions of labeled cells. GABA(B)R1a-b-immunoreactive (-ir) neurons were found in the three main layers of the dentate gyrus, the most intense labeling being present in the polymorphic layer, whereas the granule cells were moderately immunoreactive. Except for slight variations, similar distribution patterns of GABA(B)R1a-b immunostaining were found along the different subfields of the Ammon's horn (CA1-CA4). The highest density of GABA(B)R1a-b-ir neurons was localized in the stratum pyramidale, where virtually every pyramidal cell was intensely immunoreactive, including the proximal part of the apical dendrites. Within the subicular complex, a more intense GABA(B)R1a-b immunostaining was found in the subiculum than in the presubiculum or parasubiculum, especially in the pyramidal and polymorphic cell layers. In the entorhinal cortex, distribution of GABA(B)R1a-b immunoreactivity was localized mainly in both pyramidal and nonpyramidal cells of layers II, III, and VI and in the superficial part of layer V, with layers I, IV, and deep layer V being less intensely stained. In the perirhinal cortex, the most intense GABA(B)R1a-b immunoreactivity was located in the deep part of layer III and in layer V and was mainly confined to medium-sized and large pyramidal cells. Thus, the differential expression, but widespread distribution, of GABA(B)R1a-b protein found in the present study suggests the involvement of GABA(B) receptors in many circuits of the human hippocampal formation and adjacent cortical structures. Interestingly, the hippocampal formation of epileptic patients (n = 8) with hippocampal sclerosis showed similar intensity of GABA(B)R1a-b immunostaining in the surviving neurons located within or adjacent to those regions presenting neuronal loss than in the controls. However, surviving neurons in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus displayed a significant reduction in immunostaining in 7 of 8 patients. Therefore, alterations in inhibitory synaptic transmission through GABA(B) receptors appears to affect differentially certain hippocampal circuits in a population of epileptic patients. This reduction in GABA(B)R1a-b expression could contribute to the pathophysiology of temporal lobe epilepsy.
12464083	Ligand-gated ion channels in the enteric nervous system.	There are many cell surface receptors expressed by neurones in the enteric nervous system (ENS). These receptors respond to synaptically released neurotransmitters, circulating hormones and locally released substances. Cell surface receptors are also targets for many therapeutically used drugs. This review will focus on ligand-gated ion channels, i.e. receptors in which the ligand binding site and the ion channel are parts of a single multimeric receptor. Ligand-gated ion channels expressed by enteric nerves are: nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), P2X receptors, 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptors, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors,alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors and glycine receptors. P2X, 5-HT3 and nAChRs participate in fast synaptic transmission in S-type neurones in the ENS. Fast synaptic transmission occurs in some AH-type neurones, and AH neurones express all the ligand-gated ion channels listed above. Ligand-gated ion channels may be localized at extra-synaptic sites in some AH neurones and these extra-synaptic receptors may be useful targets for drugs that can be used to treat disorders of gastrointestinal function.
12600990	Declusterization of GABAA receptors affects the kinetic properties of GABAergic currents in cultured hippocampal neurons.	Speed and reliability of synaptic transmission are essential for information coding in neuronal networks and require the presence of clustered neurotransmitter receptors at the plasma membrane in precise apposition to presynaptic terminals. Receptor clusterization is the result of highly regulated processes involving functional and structural proteins. Among the structural elements, microtubules are known to play a crucial role in anchoring of gamma-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABA(A)) receptors. Here we show that microtubule depolymerization with nocodazole induces the declusterization of GABA(A) receptors and modifies the kinetic properties of GABAergic currents in cultured hippocampal neurons. In particular, this drug, applied either in the bath or via the patch pipette, induced the acceleration of the onset kinetics of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) without significantly affecting their frequency, thus suggesting a main postsynaptic site of action. After nocodazole treatment, current responses to ultrafast applications of GABA exhibited a faster rise time and an accelerated onset of desensitization. A quantitative analysis of GABA-evoked currents and model simulations suggest that declusterization affects the gating properties of GABA(A) receptors. In particular, a faster entry into the desensitized state of declustered GABA(A) receptors may account for the changes in the kinetic properties of mIPSCs after nocodazole treatment. Hence it appears that the clustered condition of GABA(A) receptors contributes in shaping GABAergic currents.
7768279	2-Hydroxy-saclofen causes a phaclofen-reversible reduction in population spike amplitude in the rat hippocampal slice.	2-Hydroxy-saclofen is known to be active at GABAB receptors in the mammalian central nervous system, and we have investigated its effects on synaptic transmission in the rat hippocampal slice preparation. Orthodromic stimuli were applied to the stratum radiatum, and population spike responses from the CA1 pyramidal cell layer were recorded extracellularly. A second, identical stimulus was applied at a variable interpulse interval (IPI) after the initial conditioning stimulus. GABAergic synaptic inhibition was observed as a decrease in the spike amplitude of the second response compared to the first. Both the GABAB receptor antagonist phaclofen (1 mM) and 2-hydroxy-saclofen (200 microM) prevented a slow phase of inhibition for IPIs of 200-400 ms. However, these agents differed markedly in their effects on overall synaptic transmission. Phaclofen had no effect on the amplitude of the initial conditioning spike amplitude, whereas 2-hydroxy-saclofen reduced it significantly, in a manner similar to baclofen (1 microM). The direct actions of 2-hydroxy-saclofen were unexpected for a pure antagonist of GABAB receptors, but could be prevented by the co-administration of phaclofen (1 mM), but not bicuculline (1 microM). Reduction in conditioning spike amplitude due to antagonism of GABAB autoreceptors on inhibitory interneurones and subsequent enhancement of GABAA tonic inhibition would have been blocked by bicuculline. The blockade of the 2-hydroxy-saclofen effect by phaclofen implies a GABAB receptor partial agonist action. The possible sites of this action are discussed.
8159245	Anchoring of protein kinase A is required for modulation of AMPA/kainate receptors on hippocampal neurons.	Phosphorylation of molecules involved in synaptic transmission by multifunctional protein kinases modulates both pre- and post-synaptic events in the central nervous system. The positioning of kinases near their substrates may be an important part of the regulatory mechanism. The A-kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs; ref. 3) are known to bind the regulatory subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A with nanomolar affinity. Here we show that anchoring of protein kinase A by AKAPs is required for the modulation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA)/kainate channels. Intracellular perfusion of cultured hippocampal neurons with peptides derived from the conserved kinase binding region of AKAPs prevented the protein kinase A-mediated regulation of AMPA/kainate currents as well as fast excitatory synaptic currents. This effect could be overcome by adding the purified catalytic subunit of protein kinase. A control peptide lacking kinase-binding activity had no effect. To our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence that anchoring of protein kinase A is crucial in the regulation of synaptic function.
9547222	G-Protein-coupled modulation of presynaptic calcium currents and transmitter release by a GABAB receptor.	Presynaptic GABAB receptors play a regulatory role in central synaptic transmission. To elucidate their underlying mechanism of action, we have made whole-cell recordings of calcium and potassium currents from a giant presynaptic terminal, the calyx of Held, and EPSCs from its postsynaptic target in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body of rat brainstem slices. The GABAB receptor agonist baclofen suppressed EPSCs and presynaptic calcium currents but had no effect on voltage-dependent potassium currents. The calcium current-EPSC relationship measured during baclofen application was similar to that observed on reducing [Ca2+]o, suggesting that the presynaptic inhibition generated by baclofen is caused largely by the suppression of presynaptic calcium influx. Presynaptic loading of the GDP analog guanosine-5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDPbetaS) abolished the effect of baclofen on both presynaptic calcium currents and EPSCs. The nonhydrolyzable GTP analog guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPgammaS) suppressed presynaptic calcium currents and occluded the effect of baclofen on presynaptic calcium currents and EPSCs. Photoactivation of GTPgammaS induced an inward rectifying potassium current at the calyx of Held, whereas baclofen had no such effect. We conclude that presynaptic GABAB receptors suppress transmitter release through G-protein-coupled inhibition of calcium currents.
10196584	Astrocyte-mediated potentiation of inhibitory synaptic transmission.	We investigated the role of astrocytes in activity-dependent modulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices. Repetitive firing of an interneuron decreased the probability of synaptic failures in spike-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (unitary IPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal neurons. The GABAB-receptor antagonist CGP55845A abolished this effect. Direct stimulation of astrocytes, or application of the GABAB-receptor agonist baclofen, potentiated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in pyramidal neurons. These effects were blocked by inhibition of astrocytic calcium signaling with the calcium chelator BAPTA or by antagonists of the ionotropic glutamate receptors. These observations suggest that interneuronal firing elicits a GABAB-receptor-mediated elevation of calcium in surrounding astrocytes, which in turn potentiates inhibitory transmission. Astrocytes may therefore be a necessary intermediary in activity-dependent modulation of inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus.
12438512	Ethanol antagonizes kainate receptor-mediated inhibition of evoked GABA(A) inhibitory postsynaptic currents in the rat hippocampal CA1 region.	Many studies have demonstrated that ethanol reduces glutamatergic synaptic transmission primarily by inhibiting the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptor. In contrast, the other two subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptor (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid and kainate) have generally been shown to be insensitive to intoxicating concentrations of ethanol. However, we have previously identified a population of kainate receptors that mediate slow excitatory postsynaptic currents in the rat hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cell region that is potently inhibited by low concentrations of ethanol. In this study, we examined the effect of ethanol on kainate receptor-mediated inhibition of evoked GABA(A) inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in the rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell region. Under our recording conditions, bath application of 1 microM kainate significantly inhibited GABA(A) IPSCs. This inhibition seemed to be mediated by the activation of somatodendritic kainate receptors on GABAergic interneurons and the subsequent activation of metabotropic GABA(B) receptors, because the kainate inhibition was largely blocked by pretreating slices with a GABA(B) receptor antagonist. Ethanol pretreatment significantly antagonized the inhibitory effect of kainate on GABA(A) IPSCs, at concentrations as low as 20 mM. In contrast, ethanol did not block the direct inhibitory effect of a GABA(B) receptor agonist on GABA(A) IPSCs. The results of this study suggest that modest concentrations of ethanol may antagonize presynaptic, as well as postsynaptic, kainate receptor function in the rat hippocampus.
12925013	Nigral GABAergic inhibition upon cholinergic neurons in the rat pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus.	We investigated, in a midbrain parasagittal slice preparation of Wistar rats (postnatal day 9-17), the synaptic inhibition of neurons in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPN), which was mediated by gamma (gamma)-amino-butyric acid (GABA). Whole-cell patch-clamp recording was used, in combination with a single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification technique, to record synaptic potentials and to identify the phenotype of the recorded PPN neuron. In the presence of the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists, 6-cyano-2, 3-dihydroxy-7-nitro-quinoxaline-2, 3, dione, and dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, single electrical stimuli were applied to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), one of the basal ganglia output nuclei. Stimulation of the SNr evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in 73 of the 104 neurons in the PPN. The IPSPs were abolished with a GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline. Inhibitory postsynaptic currents of the neurons were reversed in polarity at approximately -93.5 mV, which was close to the value of the equilibrium potential for chloride ions of -88.4 mV. Single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions revealed that approximately 30% (9/32) of the PPN neurons that received inhibition from the SNr expressed detectable levels of choline acetyltransferase mRNA. These findings show that output from the SNr regulates the activity of cholinergic PPN neurons through GABAA receptors.
14500742	A presynaptic action of the neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate on GABAergic synaptic transmission.	The endogenous neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate (PS) is known to enhance memory and cognitive function at nanomolar concentrations. However, the effect of these low concentrations on synaptic transmission has not been previously studied. The effects of PS on GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents were studied in cultured hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Concentrations of PS similar to those endogenous in the hippocampus (10-30 nM) reduced the frequency of both action potential-dependent (spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current) and -independent (miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current; mIPSC) inhibitory postsynaptic currents. This effect of PS was mimicked by the selective sigma1 receptor agonist [2S-(2alpha,6alpha,11R]-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexahydro-6,11-dimethyl-3-(2-propenyl)-2,6-methano-3-benzazocin-8-ol hydrochloride [(+)-SKF 10047] and blocked the specific sigma1 receptor antagonists 1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-4-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (BD-1063) and haloperidol and by pertussis toxin. The GABAB antagonist baclofen and the metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist (R,S)-a-cyclopropyl-4-phosphonophenylglycine had no effect on the PS-mediated inhibition of mIPSC frequency. The postsynaptic effects of PS occurred at micromolar concentrations but not at nanomolar concentrations. A comparison of the pre- and postsynaptic effects of PS demonstrated that it was 100-fold more potent in inhibiting presynaptic GABAergic synaptic mechanisms than GABAA receptors. These studies demonstrate that concentrations of PS, similar to those endogenous in the hippocampus, inhibit GABAergic synaptic transmission by a presynaptic effect. PS causes specific activation of G protein-coupled sigma1 receptors, resulting in modulation of both action potential-dependent and -independent IPSCs. These findings improve our understanding of the physiological function of PS.
7536844	[Recent advances in studies of GABA receptors: neurochemical aspects].	gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been established as a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. The GABA-induced inhibitory transmission is mediated by two distinct types of GABA receptors which are termed as GABAA and GABAA receptors. The GABAA receptor forms a Cl- channel that consists of several subunits. The recent development of molecular cloning clarified the presence of multiple and heterogeneous molecules in the GABAA receptor subunits. Therefore, it is suggested that multiple GABAB receptors generate various functions in the brain. In contrast, the GABAB receptor exhibits various metabotropic actions for the inhibitory neurotransmission, since it is coupled with GTP-binding proteins. The GABAB receptor of approximately 80 kDa protein in its molecular weight was purified from the bovine cerebral cortex and the presence of another molecular species of the GABAB receptor was also suspected. These results indicate that studies on the molecular diversity of the GABA receptors is important for elucidating the functional roles of GABAergic neurons in the brain.
7775967	Postnatal maturation of gamma-aminobutyric acidA and B-mediated inhibition in the CA3 hippocampal region of the rat.	In the adult central nervous system, GABAergic synaptic inhibition is known to play a crucial role in preventing the spread of excitatory glutamatergic activity. This inhibition is achieved by a membrane hyperpolarization through the activation of postsynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) and GABAB receptors. In addition, GABA also depress transmitter release acting through presynaptic GABAB receptors. Despite the wealth of data regarding the role of GABA in regulating the degree of synchronous activity in the adult, little is known about GABA transmission during early stages of development. In the following we report that GABA mediates most of the excitatory drive at early stages of development in the hippocampal CA3 region. Activation of GABAA receptors induces a depolarization and excitation of immature CA3 pyramidal neurons and increases intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i)] during the first postnatal week of life. During the same developmental period, the postsynaptic GABAB-mediated inhibition is poorly developed. In contrast, the presynaptic GABAB-mediated inhibition is well developed at birth and plays a crucial role in modulating the postsynaptic activity by depressing transmitter release at early postnatal stages. We have also shown that GABA plays a trophic role in the neuritic outgrowth of cultured hippocampal neurons.
7964997	Temporally distinct mechanisms of use-dependent depression at inhibitory synapses in the rat hippocampus in vitro.	1. Gamma-aminobutyric acid-B (GABAB) autoreceptor-dependent and -independent components of paired-pulse depression (PPD) at inhibitory synapses in area CA3 of the rat hippocampus were studied using whole-cell recording techniques. Inhibitory fibers were activated directly in the presence of the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3,dione (20 microM) and D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (20 microM). 2. When pairs of monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) were evoked with an interstimulus interval of 200 ms, the amplitude of the second response (eIPSC2) was depressed when compared with the first (eIPSC1). The GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (10 microM) depressed both responses, but eIPSC1 was depressed more than eIPSC2, resulting in PPD that was comparatively smaller. Addition of the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP 55845A (1 microM) completely reversed depression of eIPSC1 by baclofen and increased the amplitude of eIPSC2 above the control value, such that PPD in the combination of baclofen and CGP 55845A was equivalent to that in baclofen alone. The ratio eIPSC2/eIPSC1 was 0.64 under control conditions, 0.77 in the presence of baclofen, and 0.79 in the presence of baclofen and CGP 55845A. These results demonstrate the existence of two components of PPD at inhibitory synapses, one that depends on activation of GABAB autoreceptors (GABAB receptor-dependent PPD) and one that does not (GABAB receptor-independent PPD). 3. When the number of inhibitory fibers activated was lowered by decreasing the stimulus intensity, eIPSC2/eIPSC1 was 0.76 under control conditions, 0.75 in the presence of baclofen, and 0.76 in the presence of baclofen and CGP 55845A. These results indicate that GABAB receptor-dependent PPD requires activation of several presynaptic inhibitory neurons, whereas GABAB receptor-independent PPD does not. 4. The time-courses of the GABAB-dependent and -independent components of PPD were compared by varying the interstimulus interval in the absence and presence of CGP 55845A. GABAB-dependent PPD was maximal at an interstimulus interval of 100 ms and was undetectable at 1 s. In contrast, GABAB-independent PPD was maximal at 5 ms and 1 s, was slightly less pronounced at intermediate intervals (50-200 ms), and was present at intervals as long as 5 s. 5. GABAB-independent PPD was not blocked by antagonists at opioid receptors (10 microM naloxone) or muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (10 microM atropine). GABAB-independent PPD could not be accounted for by a decrease in driving force because of Cl- redistribution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
8182474	A cyclic AMP-dependent form of associative synaptic plasticity induced by coactivation of beta-adrenergic receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors in rat hippocampus.	Recent studies suggest that increases in intracellular cAMP increase evoked synaptic responses in area CA1 of the hippocampus. We recently reported that activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in hippocampal slices potentiates cAMP responses to activation of other receptors that are positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase through Gs. It is possible that by enhancing cAMP responses, mGluRs could markedly potentiate the ability of agonists of Gs-coupled receptors to potentiate synaptic responses in area CA1. Such synergistic activation of a second messenger system could be involved in an associative form of neuronal plasticity in which simultaneous activation of two independent inputs to a cell is required for induction of a given change in synaptic transmission or neuronal excitability. We therefore tested the hypothesis that coactivation of mGluRs and a Gs-coupled receptor (the beta-adrenergic receptor) could lead to large increases in cAMP accumulation in hippocampus and thereby increase synaptic responses in area CA1. We report that coactivation of mGluRs and beta-adrenergic receptors leads to a lasting (> 30 min) increase in the amplitude of evoked population spikes at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse. This effect is not accompanied by an increase in excitatory postsynaptic currents or by a decrease in synaptic inhibition in area CA1, suggesting that it is not mediated by a lasting change in excitatory or inhibitory synaptic transmission. However, coactivation of these receptors leads to a persistent depolarization of CA1 pyramidal cells with a concomitant increase in input resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
8274277	Heterogeneity in presynaptic regulation of GABA release from hippocampal inhibitory neurons.	Release of GABA from the terminals of hippocampal inhibitory neurons is inhibited by activation of GABAB autoreceptors and mu opioid receptors. However, it is not known whether these presynaptic processes affect all inhibitory synapses equally. We examined the effects of the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen and the mu opioid receptor agonist DAGO on postsynaptic currents evoked by minimal stimulation of inhibitory fibers (meIPSCs) in area CA3. Baclofen reversibly depressed approximately half of the meIPSCs evoked in the stratum pyramidale. The remaining meIPSCs were unaffected despite a coincident depression of spontaneous IPSCs. In contrast, all meIPSCs were depressed by DAGO. In addition, minimal stimulation in the stratum radiatum evoked meIPSCs that were always depressed by baclofen. These results indicate that regulation of GABA release by GABAB autoreceptors occurs at a subset of inhibitory synapses and that GABAB-resistant inhibitory synapses are located on pyramidal neuron somata. Hippocampal inhibitory neurons may be heterogeneous with respect to presynaptic receptor-mediated regulation of GABA release.
8727395	Model circuit of spiking neurons generating directional selectivity in simple cells.	1. We here consider the property of directional selectivity (DS) in simple cells of layer 4 of cat area 17 as an instance of a receptive field (RF) transformation between two monosynaptically connected neuron populations: the afferent geniculate (lateral geniculate nucleus, LGN) cells and their target, layer 4 simple cells. We have studied this particular RF transformation because the large set of experimental data available allowed us to restrain the synaptic organization of our model layer 4 circuitry. 2. The one-compartment, spiking model neurons of the layer 4 circuitry are excitatory (adapting) or inhibitory (nonadapting). They all have simple-cell RFs composed of two spatially separated ON and OFF subregions. The sequence of the subregions across the neurons' RFs, which is determined by the geniculocortical inputs they receive, varies independently from their preferred direction of stimulus motion, which is determined by spatial asymmetries in their corticocortical inputs. 3. Synaptic transmission in the model layer 4 circuitry is mediated via non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA) receptors (geniculocortical excitation), via NMDA receptors (corticocortical excitation), and via gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptors (corticocortical inhibition). Excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons receive the same afferents. However, excitatory neurons form efferent synapses exclusively with neurons having the same RF characteristics, and preferentially with those having the same RF position. Inhibitory neurons form synapses preferentially with neurons having different RF characteristics or adjacent RF positions. 4. By comparing the neurons' numerically computed responses to visual stimuli with those of actual simple cells, the topology of the corticocortical connections has been constrained. The experimental responses to stationary and moving, and to bar as well as grating, stimuli are consistently reproduced with a single constant parameter setting. 5. Subsequently, the model has been analyzed from a system-theoretic approach and has been manipulated in order to find the components critical for its proper functioning. Variations on the model have been simulated for evaluating the performance of alternative connection schemes. 6. Spatially opponent inhibition between model simple cells with antagonistic RF subregions is necessary for the restoration of linearity lost at the LGN output. It hyperpolarizes model simple cells when the contrast polarity of an efficient stimulus is reversed and prevents, particularly in directionally nonselective cells, a frequency doubling of the responses to sine wave gratings of low spatial frequencies. 7. Directionally opponent inhibition between model simple cells preferring opposite directions of motion is necessary for the generation of genuine DS (a ratio of firing rates > 2 for opposite directions of motion). 8. The corticocortical excitatory polysynaptic feedback loops in the model are able to provide the time delays needed to generate DS, and even to preserve DS at very low speeds. The strength spatial extension, and time course of this corticocortical feedback excitation, together with the dynamics of the geniculate afferents and the width of the RF, determine the tuning of model simple cells in the temporal and velocity domain. 9. The present model generates directionally selective responses to stimulus motion over distances smaller than the width of a single subregion and as small as the spacing between the afferent geniculate RFs. The direction-selective mechanism acts uniformly across the entire width of a subregion. Thus the position invariance of DS arises in the present model at the same level as DS itself. The same holds for the stimulus polarity (light vs. dark) invariance of DS. Consequently, there is no need for highly hierarchical models in which all these characteristics accumulate in simple cells by pooling from lower-order subunits or neurons.
8837380	Molecular mechanisms of action of bacterial exotoxins.	Toxins are one of the inventive strategies that bacteria have developed in order to survive. As virulence factors, they play a major role in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. Recent discoveries have once more highlighted the effectiveness of these precisely adjusted bacterial weapons. Furthermore, toxins have become an invaluable tool in the investigation of fundamental cell processes, including regulation of cellular functions by various G proteins, cytoskeletal dynamics and neural transmission. In this review, the bacterial toxins are presented in a rational classification based on the molecular mechanisms of action.
8890453	GABAA and GABAB receptors differentially regulate synaptic transmission in the auditory thalamo-amygdala pathway: an in vivo microiontophoretic study and a model.	Stimulation of the medical geniculate body elicits extracellular single unit responses in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala that are dependent upon glutamatergic neurotransmission [Li et al. (1995) Exp. Brain Res., 105-87-100]. In the present study, we examined the contribution of inhibitory amino acid transmission to these excitatory responses. Antagonists of GABAA or GABAB receptors were delivered microiontophoretically to cells activated by stimulation of the medial geniculate body. Blockade of GABAA receptors with bicuculline resulted in a pronounced increase in evoked short latency unit responses (4-8 ms). In some cases, cells that were not responsive to the stimulation became responsive in the presence of bicuculline. In contrast, delivery of GABAB antagonists, Phaclofen or 2-OH-saclofen, did not affect these short-latency responses. Using paired-pulse stimulation, both short (< 30 ms) and longer (> 50 ms) latency inhibitory processes were revealed. GABAA blockade eliminated the short latency inhibition and GABAB blockade eliminated the longer latency inhibition in most cells. These results suggest that the activation of GABAA and GABAB receptors differentially regulate glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the auditory thalamo-amygdala pathway. Moreover, our findings suggest that at least part of this regulation is via a feedforward mechanism. We tested the sufficiency of feedforward inhibition to account for the data using a simple computational model that incorporates the results presented here.
9501984	Interferon-beta is required for interferon-alpha production in mouse fibroblasts.	The type I interferons--interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and interferon-beta (IFN-beta)--are critical for protection against viruses during the acute stage of viral infection [1,2]. Furthermore, type I interferons have been implicated as important mediators in the regulation of lymphocyte development [3], immune responses [4,5] and the maintenance of immunological memory of cytotoxic T cells [6,7]. The different IFN-alpha subtypes are encoded by 12 genes in the mouse [8] whereas IFN-beta is encoded by only one gene [9]. IFN-alpha and IFN-beta have a high degree of sequence homology and are thought to interact with the same surface receptor on target cells [10,11]. As an approach to analysing the different biological functions of IFN-alpha and IFN-beta, we have generated a mouse strain with an inactivated IFN-beta gene. We report here that embryonic fibroblasts from such mice produce neither IFN-beta nor IFN-alpha upon Sendal virus infection, whereas the production of IFN-alpha by leukocytes from the same strain of mice is intact. IFN-alpha production in embryonic fibroblasts from IFN-beta-/- mice could be rescued by 'priming' the cells using exogenous IFN-beta. These results imply a unique role for IFN-beta in the induction of type I interferons in peripheral tissues.
7959412	[Molecular pharmacology of GABAA and GABAB receptors].	The receptor for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, has been classified into GABAA and GABAB subtypes. The GABAA receptor forms a Cl- channel and is consisted of several subunits. These subunits in the brain are known to be multiple and heterogeneous in their molecular structure. Therefore, it is suggested that these multiple GABAA receptors generate various inhibitory functions in the brain. In contrast, the GABAB receptor is known to be one of the metabotropic type of receptors which generate slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials and functionally couple with Gi/Go types of GTP-binding proteins. The GABAB receptor in the brain has been purified to homogeneity using immunoaffinity purification procedures and found to be an 80-kDa protein. The possible existence of multiplicity in the cerebral GABAB receptor has also been suggested.
9138672	Orphanin FQ inhibits synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation in rat hippocampus.	It is known that opioid peptides acting on opioid receptors can modulate hippocampal synaptic functions. Although a novel member of the opioid receptor family, ORL1 receptors, that displays high-sequence homology with classical opioid receptors is abundant in the hippocampus, little is known regarding its role in synaptic function. The present study was designed to investigate whether activation of the ORL1 receptor by its natural ligand, orphanin FQ, could modulate synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. The actions of orphanin FQ in the CA1 and dentate gyrus were examined by field potential recordings in response to stimulation of Schaffer collaterals and perforant path, respectively. Our results showed that orphanin FQ, but not the inactive analog des-Phe1-orphanin FQ, reduced both the slope of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials and population spike amplitude. The inhibitory effect of orphanin FQ is dose dependent and probably involves a presynaptic mechanism, as suggested by the significantly increased paired-pulse facilitation evoked in the presence of orphanin FQ. In addition, orphanin FQ was found to inhibit the induction of long-term potentiation at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse. These results demonstrate that orphanin FQ can function as an inhibitory modulator regulating synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, suggesting that activation of ORL1 receptors may play an important role in synaptic plasticity involved in learning and memory.
9184984	gamma-Aminobutyric acid receptor distribution in the mushroom bodies of a fly (Calliphora erythrocephala): a functional subdivision of Kenyon cells?	Antibodies against the Drosophila gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunit RDL were used to investigate the significance of inhibitory inputs to the mushroom bodies in the blowfly (Calliphora erythrocephala) brain. The pedunculus and the lobes of the mushroom body, which mainly consist of Kenyon cell fibers, revealed strong immunoreactivity against RDL. Pedunculi, alpha- and beta-lobe show characteristic unstained core structures with concentric labeling along the neuropile axis. The gamma-lobes in contrast exhibit a compartmentalized RDL-immunoreactive pattern. These data suggest an important role of GABAergic inhibition in the pedunculus and the lobes of insect mushroom bodies. It is most likely that the RDL-immunoreactivity in the mushroom bodies is closely related to Kenyon cell fibers suggesting that Kenyon cells are an inhomogeneous class of neurons, only part of which receive inhibitory GABAergic input from extrinsic elements. GABAergic inhibition, therefore, may play a substantial role in the process of learning and memory formation in the insect mushroom bodies.
9756866	Intracellular retention of recombinant GABAB receptors.	gamma-Aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) receptors mediate the transmission of slow and prolonged inhibitory signals in the central nervous system. Two splice variants of GABAB receptors, GABABR1a and GABABR1b, were recently cloned from a mouse cortical and cerebellar cDNA library. As predicted, these receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. We have used epitope-tagged versions of GABABR1a receptors to study the cellular distribution of these proteins in a variety of non-neuronal and neuronal cell types. Here we report that recombinant GABAB receptors fail to reach the cell surface when expressed in heterologous systems and are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum when introduced into COS cells. In addition, we prove that recombinant GABAB receptors are excluded from the cell surface when overexpressed in ganglion neurons and we further demonstrate that they fail to activate in superior cervical ganglion neurons. Together our observations suggest that recombinant GABAB receptors require additional information for functional targeting to the plasma membrane.
9886649	The unitary modification rules for neural networks with excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity.	The unitary Hebbian modification rules for homo-, hetero- and associative LTP and LTD of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the neocortex and hippocampus is proposed. To provide the realization of Hebbian rule it is postulated that only synapses activated by the transmitter are modifiable. The necessary condition for the induction of heterosynaptic LTD is the convergence of homo- and heterosynaptic afferents on both the target cell and 'common' inhibitory interneuron; and modification of common inhibitory pathway efficacy. It is revealed by computational model of postsynaptic processes that in a stationary state post-tetanic synaptic efficacy does not depend on the initial efficacy but is completely defined by the amount of transmitter released during tetanization. Excitatory (inhibitory) synaptic efficacy monotonically increases (decreases) with the intracellular Ca2+ rise that is proportional to stimulation frequency enlargement. Hebbian rule, the coincidence of pre- and postsynaptic cell activity, is only necessary conditions for synaptic plasticity. Modification, such as simultaneous LTP of excitation and LTD of inhibition (LTD of excitation and LTP of inhibition) could be obtained only due to variations in pre- and/or postsynaptic activity and subsequent positive (negative) shift in the ratio between protein kinases and phosphatases in reference to prior ratio.
11125035	Gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptors with specific heterodimer composition and postsynaptic actions in hippocampal neurons are targets of anticonvulsant gabapentin action.	Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activates two qualitatively different inhibitory mechanisms through ionotropic GABA(A) multisubunit chloride channel receptors and metabotropic GABA(B) G protein-coupled receptors. Evidence suggests that pharmacologically distinct GABA(B) receptor subtypes mediate presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitter release by reducing Ca2+ conductance, and postsynaptic inhibition of neuronal excitability by activating inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) conductance. However, the cloning of GABA(B) gb1 and gb2 receptor genes and identification of the functional GABA(B) gb1-gb2 receptor heterodimer have so far failed to substantiate the existence of pharmacologically distinct receptor subtypes. The anticonvulsant, antihyperalgesic, and anxiolytic agent gabapentin (Neurontin) is a 3-alkylated GABA analog with an unknown mechanism of action. Here we report that gabapentin is an agonist at the GABA(B) gb1a-gb2 heterodimer coupled to Kir 3.1/3.2 inwardly rectifying K+ channels in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Gabapentin was practically inactive at the human gb1b-gb2 heterodimer, a novel human gb1c-gb2 heterodimer and did not block GABA agonism at these heterodimer subtypes. Gabapentin was not an agonist at recombinant GABA(A) receptors as well. In CA1 pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampal slices, gabapentin activated postsynaptic K+ currents, probably via the gb1a-gb2 heterodimer coupled to inward rectifiers, but did not presynaptically depress monosynaptic GABA(A) inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Gabapentin is the first GABA(B) receptor subtype-selective agonist identified providing proof of pharmacologically and physiologically distinct receptor subtypes. This selective agonism of postsynaptic GABA(B) receptor subtypes by gabapentin in hippocampal neurons may be its key therapeutic advantage as an anticonvulsant.
11465598	Isoflurane blocks synaptic plasticity in the mouse hippocampus.	BACKGROUND: The volatile anesthetic isoflurane depresses glutamatergic transmission. In this study, the authors investigated the effects of isoflurane on the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in slices from the juvenile and adult mouse hippocampus. Both forms of synaptic plasticity involve the activation of glutamate receptors. METHODS: Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials and excitatory postsynaptic currents from neurons in the CA1 area were evoked by stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway. Two independent synaptic inputs were stimulated. Clinically relevant concentrations (0.2-0.3 mM) of isoflurane were added to the perfusion solution. RESULTS: Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials from slices of juvenile and adult mice were depressed to 37.3 +/- 6.1% and 58.3 +/- 7.4%, respectively, and excitatory postsynaptic currents were reduced to 36.7 +/- 5.4% by isoflurane. A brief tetanic stimulation (100 Hz, 1 s) induced stable LTP of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials. In the presence of isoflurane, tetanization failed to induce LTP. The effect of isoflurane on LTP induction was reversible and could be prevented by antagonizing gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAA). Low-frequency stimulation (1 Hz/900 pulses) induced LTD. In the presence of isoflurane, low-frequency stimulation failed to induce LTD. CONCLUSIONS: The prevention of the isoflurane-induced depression of LTP by the GABAA antagonist picrotoxin suggests an involvement of GABAA receptors. An enhancement of the efficacy of GABA-mediated inhibitory synaptic transmission prevents the depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane during tetanus, necessary for the induction of use-dependent alteration of synaptic strength. An impairment of these processes may be a cause for the transient loss of recall and cognitive impairment after anesthesia in juvenile and adult brains.
12810098	The Toll-IL-1 receptor adaptor family grows to five members.	Toll-like receptor (TLR) signal transduction is mediated by an adaptor protein termed MyD88. In the case of TLR2 and TLR4, another adaptor related to MyD88 called Mal also participates in signalling. Two recent papers have added a third adaptor to the family, called Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-beta (IFN-beta) (TRIF) or TIR-containing adaptor molecule-1 (TICAM-1), which is particularly important for IFN regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) activation by antiviral TLR3. Two additional adaptors are present in humans, termed Trif-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) and sterile alpha and HEAT-Armadillo motifs (SARM). It is probable that differential use of adaptors will help explain the distinct pathways activated by TLRs during host defence.
7472344	Calcium channel involvement in GABAB receptor-mediated inhibition of GABA release in area CA1 of the rat hippocampus.	1. Experiments were performed in rat hippocampal slices to examine the nature of GABAergic inhibition of inhibitory synaptic transmission. In these experiments the effects of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-B (GABAB) receptor agonist, baclofen, and of subtype-selective calcium channel blockers were tested with the use of intracellular recordings of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) and whole cell recordings of spontaneous GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). 2. Baclofen inhibited evoked and spontaneous (action-potential-dependent) monosynaptic GABAA-mediated IPSPs and IPSCs but had no effect on the frequency of tetrodotoxin-resistant (action-potential-independent) miniature IPSCs recorded in CA1 pyramidal neurons. 3. Depolarizing GABAergic synaptic terminals by raising the extracellular potassium concentration caused an increase in action-potential-independent miniature IPSC frequency that could be inhibited by either baclofen or cadmium, a blocker of voltage-dependent calcium channels. In addition, under these depolarizing conditions, cadmium occluded the baclofen inhibition of miniature IPSCs. These data suggest that baclofen reduces only depolarization-induced, not quantal, GABA release and that it does so by decreasing presynaptic voltage-dependent calcium influx. 4. Experiments with subtype-selective calcium channel blockers demonstrate that the presynaptic action of baclofen was mediated through both omega-conotoxin-GVIA-sensitive and omega-agatoxin-IVA-sensitive, but not dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels.
7542462	Desensitized states prolong GABAA channel responses to brief agonist pulses.	We studied the role of desensitization at inhibitory synapses by comparing nonequilibrium GABAA channel gating with inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). Currents activated by brief pulses of 1-10 mM GABA to outside-out patches from cultured hippocampal neurons mimicked GABA-mediated IPSCs. Although the average open time of single GABAA channels following brief pulses was less than 10 ms, channels entered long (tau = 38-69 ms) closed states and subsequently reopened. Movement through these states resulted in paired-pulse desensitization. The time required for deactivation after removal of agonist also increased in proportion to the extent of desensitization. These results suggest that visits to desensitized states buffer the channel in bound conformations and underlie the expression of long-lasting components of the IPSC. Reopening after GABAA receptor desensitization may thus enhance inhibitory synaptic transmission by prolonging the response to a brief synaptic GABA transient.
9666119	Brain-derived neurotrophic factor rapidly potentiates synaptic transmission through NMDA, but suppresses it through non-NMDA receptors in rat hippocampal neuron.	Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rapidly enhances synaptic transmission among the hippocampal neurons. In order to examine which component of glutamate receptors participates in synaptic potentiation by BDNF, we have studied the effect of glutamate antagonists on excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) enhanced by BDNF, using cultured embryonic hippocampal neurons. In the presence of AP5, a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, BDNF depressed the EPSCs. In contrast, BDNF enhanced the EPSCs in the presence of a non-NMDA antagonist CNQX. Our results suggest that BDNF acutely activates synaptic transmission via NMDA, but suppresses it via non-NMDA receptors in the hippocampus.
10604925	gamma-aminobutyric acid(B) receptors: first of the functional metabotropic heterodimers.	Activation of the metabotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid(B) (GABA(B)) receptor increases K(+) conductance and decreases Ca(2+) channel activity in neuronal membranes. Studies with a number of new GABA(B) receptor agonists and antagonists reveal that in addition to their muscle relaxant effects, agonists display analgesic activity and reduce the craving for cocaine. With regard to GABA(B) receptor antagonists, preclinical data suggest they improve cognitive performance and possess antidepressant and antiepileptic potential. With a high-affinity GABA(B) antagonist, the structural properties of the receptor were characterized through expression cloning. Moreover, it has been found that expression of a fully functional GABA(B) receptor requires coupling between two separate and distinct gene products: GABA(B) R1 and GABA(B) R2. Besides being the first example of a functional heterodiameric metabotropic receptor, the components and molecular configuration of the GABA(B) receptor suggest novel mechanisms for producing pharmacologically distinct subtypes of G protein-coupled receptors.
11050117	Constitutive endocytosis of GABAA receptors by an association with the adaptin AP2 complex modulates inhibitory synaptic currents in hippocampal neurons.	Type A GABA receptors (GABA(A)) mediate the majority of fast synaptic inhibition in the brain and are believed to be predominantly composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. Although changes in cell surface GABA(A) receptor number have been postulated to be of importance in modulating inhibitory synaptic transmission, little is currently known on the mechanism used by neurons to modify surface receptor levels at inhibitory synapses. To address this issue, we have studied the cell surface expression and maintenance of GABA(A) receptors. Here we show that constitutive internalization of GABA(A) receptors in hippocampal neurons and recombinant receptors expressed in A293 cells is mediated by clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Furthermore, we identify an interaction between the GABA(A) receptor beta and gamma subunits with the adaptin complex AP2, which is critical for the recruitment of integral membrane proteins into clathrin-coated pits. GABA(A) receptors also colocalize with AP2 in cultured hippocampal neurons. Finally, blocking clathrin-dependant endocytosis with a peptide that disrupts the association between amphiphysin and dynamin causes a large sustained increase in the amplitude of miniature IPSCs in cultured hippocampal neurons. These results suggest that GABA(A) receptors cycle between the synaptic membrane and intracellular sites, and their association with AP2 followed by recruitment into clathrin-coated pits represents an important mechanism in the postsynaptic modulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission.
12428274	Effects of antibodies against protein S100b on synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation in CA-1 hippocampal neurons in rats.	Effects of idiotypic and antiidiotypic antibodies against protein S100b on synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation of CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampus were studied. Idiotypic antibodies against protein S100b inhibited synaptic transmission from Schaffer collateral axons to pyramidal neurons, but had no effect on neuronal responses to antidromic stimulation. Antiidiotypic antibodies against protein S100b facilitated neuronal responses to orthodromic stimulation. Idiotypic antibodies against protein S100b suppressed changes in neuronal responses to orthodromic stimulation during long-term potentiation, while antiidiotypic antibodies facilitated these effects. Our findings suggest that the effects of idiotypic and antiidiotypic antibodies to protein S100b are associated with their regulatory influences on synaptic transmission. These mechanisms differ from mechanisms of synaptic plasticity involved in long-term potentiation.
7638623	Ionic mechanisms of neuronal excitation by inhibitory GABAA receptors.	Gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptors are the principal mediators of synaptic inhibition, and yet when intensely activated, dendritic GABAA receptors excite rather than inhibit neurons. The membrane depolarization mediated by GABAA receptors is a result of the differential, activity-dependent collapse of the opposing concentration gradients of chloride and bicarbonate, the anions that permeate the GABAA ionophore. Because this depolarization diminishes the voltage-dependent block of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor by magnesium, the activity-dependent depolarization mediated by GABA is sufficient to account for frequency modulation of synaptic NMDA receptor activation. Anionic gradient shifts may represent a mechanism whereby the rate and coherence of synaptic activity determine whether dendritic GABAA receptor activation is excitatory or inhibitory.
8768713	Effects of a memory-enhancing drug on DL-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor currents and synaptic transmission in hippocampus.	The benzoylpiperidine drug BDP-12 (1-(quinoxalin-6-ylcarbonyl)piperidine) enhances the encoding of transient and stable forms of memory by rats. Results reported here show that the drug increases fast, excitatory (glutamatergic) synaptic responses in hippocampal slices by about 50% with an EC50 of 170 microM. Analyses with polysynaptic responses indicated that the drug has a facilitatory action at concentrations as low as 12.5 microM. BDP-12 at 1 mM did not change the resting membrane potential, input resistance or spiking threshold and it did not alter monosynaptic potentials mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors; it did, however, enhance disynaptic inhibitory responses. In membrane patches excised from hippocampal neurons, BDP-12 at moderate concentrations (50 microM) increased the steady-state currents mediated by DL-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors and slowed the rate at which the receptors desensitize, with a much larger effect on the former; the drug delayed the closing of the AMPA receptor channel after 1-msec agonist pulses. BDP-12 had no detectable effect on [3H]AMPA binding affinity. A related and more potent analog produced a different pattern of results in that it had about equal effects on steady-state currents and desensitization rates and significantly increased binding to AMPA receptors. These results indicate that the benzoylpiperidine family of modulators has functionally distinct subclasses. The findings also establish that BDP-12: 1) enhances synaptic responses in the same concentration range at which it alters AMPA receptor kinetics, 2) has a lower apparent threshold for effects on complex network operations than on monosynaptic transmission, 3) does not directly influence inhibitory responses and 4) is likely to modulate AMPA receptors on interneurons as well as on pyramidal neurons.
9593833	Large frequency potentiation induced by 2 Hz stimulation in the hippocampus of epileptic El mice.	El mouse has been found to be characteristics with hippocampal disinhibition, and has been suggested decrease in GABAergic synaptic transmission [Ono et al., Brain Res. 745 (1997) 165-172; Fueta et al. , Brain Res. 779 (1998) 324-328]. The efficacy of GABAergic synapses can be modulated in response to trains of low frequency stimulation. The frequency potentiation of a population spike (PS) and the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) induced by a low frequency stimulation (2 Hz for 15 s) were recorded for the CA3 subfield, and PS alone for the CA1 subfield and dentate gyrus. PS frequency potentiation was greater in El mice than in non-epileptic control ddY mice. Especially the CA3 subfield exhibited a high PS frequency potentiation (300+/-73%) compared to age-matched ddY mice (64+/-24%). However, EPSP frequency potentiation was similar in El and ddY mice. The degree of PS frequency potentiation in CA3 was decreased by the reduction of extracellular Ca2+ from 2 to 1 mM in both strains, suggesting presynaptic involvement. The potentiation in El mice was suppressed by AMPA/kainate type receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dion (CNQX), but more than half of the control value remained at 5 microM, whereas the potentiation in ddY mice was abolished at this concentration. N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) type receptor antagonist 3-3 (2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl) propyl-1-phosphonate (10 microM; CPP) did not affect the potentiation. Bicuculline (5 microM), GABAA receptor antagonist, did not increase the amplitude of PS during stimulation but induced epileptic (multiple PSs) potentials. High PS frequency potentiation of El mice was mimicked to the degree of that in ddY mice by a low dose of GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (3 microM). The suppression by baclofen was partially reversed by the antagonist saclofen (500 microM). The large frequency potentiation in young El mice, which do not have seizure-susceptibility, indicates an intrinsic property in El mice. It is suggested that the high synchronization of CA3 neurons in El mice is due to a little activation of GABAB receptor activation and also to enhancement of non-NMDA type synaptic transmission.
9804351	Molecular regulation of UVB-induced cutaneous angiogenesis.	We determined whether cutaneous angiogenesis induced by exposure of mice to ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation is associated with an imbalance between positive and negative angiogenesis-regulating molecules. Unshaved C3H/HeN mice were exposed to a single dose (15 kJ per m2) of UVB. At various times, the mice were killed, and their external ears were processed for routine histology and immunohistochemistry. Antibodies against proliferating cell nuclear antigen and bromodeoxyuridine identified dividing cells. Antibodies against CD31/ PECAM-1 identified endothelial cells, and antibodies against basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor, and interferon-beta (IFN-beta) identified angiogenesis-regulating molecules. Epidermal hyperplasia was documented by 48 h and reached a maximum on day 7 after exposure to UVB. The expression of bFGF increased by 24 h, whereas the expression of IFN-beta decreased by 72 h after exposure to UVB. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor increased slightly after irradiation. The altered balance between bFGF and IFN-beta was associated with increased endothelial cell proliferation (bromodeoxyuridine + CD31 + cells) within existing blood vessels, leading to telangiectasia and new blood vessels. UV-induced epidermal hyperplasia and cutaneous angiogenesis were highest in IFN-alpha/beta receptor knockout mice. These results demonstrate that in response to UVB radiation, dividing keratinocytes produce a positive angiogenic molecule (bFGF) but not a negative angiogenic molecule (IFN-beta), and that this altered balance is associated with enhanced cutaneous angiogenesis.
9927703	Glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid mediate a heterosynaptic depression at mossy fiber synapses in the hippocampus.	Mossy fiber synapses form the major excitatory input into the autoassociative network of pyramidal cells in the CA3 area of the hippocampus. Here we demonstrate that at the mossy fiber synapses, glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) act as autaptic and heterosynaptic presynaptic inhibitory transmitters through metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and GABAB receptors, respectively. Both GABAB receptors and mGluRs are activated through spillover from adjacent synapses. We demonstrate that glutamate spillover caused by brief tetanic activation of mossy fiber terminals remains intact at physiological temperatures. The activation of GABAB receptors increased the threshold for mossy fiber long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas activation of mGluRs did not have such an effect. We speculate that this heterosynaptic depression provides the mossy fiber synapses with a mechanism to efficiently shape input patterns into CA3, increasing the sparseness of the mossy fiber signal and enhancing the capacity and performance of the CA3 associative network. The increase in LTP threshold through activation of presynaptic inhibitory receptors imparts a piesynoptic associative nature to mossy fiber LTP.
11369028	Regulation of spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission by endogenous glutamate via non-NMDA receptors in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.	The regulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission by endogenously released glutamate was studied in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. After 7 days in vitro (DIV), both spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) and spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) could be detected. After 15 DIV, most postsynaptic spontaneous currents occurred as sEPSC/sIPSC sequences when recorded at a holding voltage of -30 mV. In the presence of the glutamate alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor subtype antagonist LY303070, both the frequency and amplitude of sIPSC were strongly and reversibly reduced. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5), had no effect on sIPSC while cyclothiazide strongly increased sIPSC frequency. Under blockade of AMPA receptors, the kainate- and GluR5-selective kainate receptor agonists, (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-tert-butylisoxazol-4-yl) propanoic acid) (ATPA) and (S)-5-iodowillardiine (5IWill), induced a large enhancement of the frequency of small-amplitude sIPSC which was blocked by the non-NMDA receptor antagonist, 2,3-dihydro-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(f)quinoxaline (NBQX). All of these effects were sensitive to tetrodotoxin (TTX). In the presence of LY303070 and TTX, kainate could induce a small inward current while GluR5 agonists had no effect. In the presence of NMDA and AMPA receptor antagonists, the glutamate uptake inhibitor L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (t-PDC) could restore sIPSC. When NBQX was used as an AMPA antagonist, the stimulatory effect of t-PDC was blocked while the group I metabotropic glutamate agonist, 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), induced a strong enhancement of sIPSC. Therefore, both AMPA and kainate receptors can regulate inhibitory synaptic transmission in cultured hippocampal neurons, the former by tonic activation, the latter when the glutamate concentration is increased by impairing glutonate uptake.
12527730	GABA B receptor modulation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission onto rat CA3 hippocampal interneurons.	Hippocampal stratum radiatum inhibitory interneurons receive glutamatergic excitatory innervation via the recurrent collateral fibers of CA3 pyramidal neurons and GABAergic inhibition from other interneurons. We examined both presynaptic- and postsynaptic-GABA(B) receptor-mediated responses at both synapse types. Postsynaptic GABA(B) receptor-mediated responses were absent in recordings from young (P16-18) but present in recordings from older animals (> or =P30) suggesting developmental regulation. In young animals, the GABA(B) receptor agonist, baclofen, inhibited the amplitude of evoked EPSCs and IPSCs, an effect blocked by prior application of the selective antagonist CGP55845. Baclofen enhanced the paired-pulse ratio and coefficient of variation of evoked EPSCs and IPSCs, consistent with a presynaptic mechanism of regulation. In addition, baclofen reduced the frequency of miniature IPSCs but not mEPSCs. However, baclofen reduced the frequency of KCl-induced mEPSCs; an effect blocked by Cd(2+), implicating presynaptic voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels as a target for baclofen modulation. In contrast, although Cd(2+) prevented the KCl-induced increase in mIPSC frequency, it failed to block baclofen's reduction of mIPSC frequency. Whereas N- and P/Q-types of Ca(2+) channels contributed equally to GABA(B) receptor-mediated inhibition of EPSCs, more P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels were involved in GABA(B) receptor-mediated inhibition of IPSCs. Finally, baclofen blocked the frequency-dependent depression of EPSCs and IPSCs, but was less effective at blocking frequency-dependent facilitation of EPSCs. Our results demonstrate that presynaptic GABA(B) receptors are expressed on the terminals of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses onto CA3 interneurons and that their activation modulates essential components of the release process underlying transmission at these two synapse types.
12742643	Involvement of the GABAergic system for Ptychodiscus brevis toxin-induced depression of synaptic transmission elicited in isolated spinal cord from neonatal rats.	The involvement of inhibitory transmitters for Ptychodiscus brevis toxin (PbTx)-induced depression of spinal synaptic transmission in neonatal rats was investigated. Stimulation of a dorsal root evoked monosynaptic reflex (MSR) and polysynaptic reflex (PSR) potentials in the segmental ventral root. The PbTx depressed the reflexes in a concentration-dependent manner and the depression was blocked by GABA(A) antagonist, bicuculline (1 microM). GABA also produced depression of the reflexes in a concentration-dependent manner. Simultaneous application of submaximal concentrations of PbTx (28 microM) and GABA (30 microM) enhanced the depression (>75%). In contrast, PbTx alone (28 microM) depressed the MSR and the PSR by 33 and 47%, respectively, and GABA (30 microM) alone depressed the reflexes by 30%. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, DL-2-amino-5-phosphono-pentanoic acid (10 microM), blocked the PbTx-induced depression of MSR and also the enhancement of GABA response by PbTx. A glycine receptor antagonist, strychnine (1 microM), failed to block the depression by the toxin up to 28 microM; however, the depression was attenuated significantly at 84 microM of the toxin. The results indicate that PbTx depressed the spinal reflexes via GABA(A) receptors. Furthermore, the potentiation of GABAergic action by PbTx requires the N-methyl-D-aspartate dependent mechanism.
7839607	Cholinergic modulation of synaptic transmission in the rat visual cortex in vitro.	Cholinergic synaptic modulation in the rat visual cortex was studied using intracellular recordings from slice preparations. A cholinergic agonist, carbachol (CCh), reduced fast excitatory as well as fast and slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials evoked by white matter stimulation. This effect was antagonized by atropine. CCh perfusion did not reduce glutamate- or gamma-aminobutyric acid-induced depolarizations, suggesting the presynaptic mechanism of the suppression. CCh augmented firing over a long period after transsynaptic stimulation combined with a long depolarizing current pulse, not only due to a decrease in firing accommodation but also due to disinhibition. CCh also induced a large sustained depolarization and bursting of action potentials triggered by tetanic stimulation. These results suggest that cholinergic modulation results in a prolonged increase in neuronal excitability during the late phase of synaptic transmissions at least partly by the mechanism of decreasing inhibitory transmissions, particularly when the synaptic inputs are strongly activated.
8138953	Potentiation of GABAA-mediated synaptic current by ethanol in hippocampal CA1 neurons: possible role of protein kinase C.	Ethanol has been reported to interact with numerous voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels in central mammalian neurons. In particular, the type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor/chloride ionophore complex has received considerable attention as a cellular substrate for ethanol and other sedative-hypnotic drugs. Direct electrophysiological evidence that ethanol modulates GABAA receptor function has been controversial. In this study, we investigated the effects of ethanol on the GABAA receptors that mediate fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in the rat hippocampus. Using the whole-cell patch-clamp recording technique in brain slices, we found that clinically relevant concentrations of ethanol (10-50 mM) potentiate pharmacologically isolated GABAA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) recorded from rat hippocampal CA1 neurons. In addition, we demonstrate that ethanol- but not diazepam-mediated enhancement of GABAA IPSCs requires intracellular ATP and can be blocked by Ro-31-8220 or PKC19-31, specific inhibitors of protein kinase C. Furthermore, the active phorbol ester 4-beta-PDBu but not its inactive analog also interferes with ethanol enhancement of GABAA IPSCs. These results demonstrate that ethanol potentiation of pharmacologically isolated GABAA IPSCs can be modulated by protein kinase C.
10368409	Reciprocal synaptic interactions between rod bipolar cells and amacrine cells in the rat retina.	Reciprocal synaptic transmission between rod bipolar cells and presumed A17 amacrine cells was studied by whole cell voltage-clamp recording of rod bipolar cells in a rat retinal slice preparation. Depolarization of a rod bipolar cell evoked two identifiable types of Ca2+ current, a T-type current that activated at about -70 mV and a current with L-type pharmacology that activated at about -50 mV. Depolarization to greater than or equal to -50 mV also evoked an increase in the frequency of postsynaptic currents (PSCs). The PSCs reversed at approximately ECl (the chloride equilibrium potential), followed changes in ECl, and were blocked by gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) and GABAC receptor antagonists and thus were identified as GABAergic inhibitory PSCs (IPSCs). Bipolar cells with cut axons displayed the T-type current but lacked an L-type current and depolarization-evoked IPSCs. Thus L-type Ca2+ channels are placed strategically at the axon terminals to mediate transmitter release from rod bipolar cells. The IPSCs were blocked by the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA) receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, indicating that non-NMDA receptors mediate the feed-forward bipolar-to-amacrine excitation. The NMDA receptor antagonist 3-((RS)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid had no consistent effect on the depolarization-evoked IPSCs, indicating that activation of NMDA receptors is not essential for the feedforward excitation. Tetrodotoxin (a blocker of voltage-gated Na+ channels) reversibly suppressed the reciprocal response in some cells but not in others, indicating that graded potentials are sufficient for transmitter release from A17 amacrine cells, but suggesting that voltage-gated Na+ channels, under some conditions, can contribute to transmitter release.
10898970	Spillover in the spotlight.	Fast neurotransmission in the brain is typically mediated by local actions of transmitters at ionotropic receptors within synaptic contacts. Recent studies now reveal that, in addition to point-to-point signaling, amino-acid transmitters mediate diffuse signaling at extrasynaptic metabotropic receptors.
10925172	An antisense investigation of the role of the gamma-aminobutyric acidB1 receptor subunit in Ca2+ channel modulation in rat sensory neurones.	Activation of gamma-aminobutyric acid(B) (GABA(B)) receptors in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurones leads to inhibition of calcium (Ca(2+)) channels. The role of the GABA(B1) receptor subunit was assessed by its depletion achieved by microinjection of DRG neurones with an antisense (A/S) oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN). Control neurones were injected with a scrambled version of the A/S ODN (missense) or were not injected. Patch clamp recordings of Ca(2+) channel current were made two to four days after injection. GABA(B1) A/S substantially reduced the current inhibition induced by baclofen, a GABA(B) agonist. Therefore, most, if not all, native GABA(B) receptors which couple to Ca(2+) channels contain GABA(B1). Moreover, if native receptors are heterodimers of GABA(B1) and GABA(B2), then GABA(B2), in isolation, is unable to sustain coupling to Ca(2+) channels.
11102470	GABA spillover from single inhibitory axons suppresses low-frequency excitatory transmission at the cerebellar glomerulus.	GABA type B receptors (GABA(B)-Rs) are present on excitatory terminals throughout the CNS, but surprisingly little is known about their role in modulating neurotransmission under physiological conditions. We have investigated activation of GABA(B)-Rs on excitatory terminals within the cerebellar glomerulus, a structure where glutamatergic excitatory and GABAergic inhibitory terminals are in close apposition and make axodendritic synapses onto granule cells. Application of the GABA(B)-R agonist baclofen depressed evoked mossy fiber EPSCs by 54% at 1 Hz. The amplitude of miniature EPSCs recorded in tetrodotoxin was unchanged in the presence of baclofen, but the frequency was significantly reduced, indicating a purely presynaptic action of baclofen under our recording conditions. At physiological temperature (37 degrees C) presynaptic GABA(B)-Rs were not tonically activated by spontaneous GABA release from Golgi cells, which fire at approximately 8 Hz in slices at this temperature. However, tonic activation could be induced by blocking GABA uptake or by lowering temperature. GABA(B)-Rs were activated at physiological temperature when Golgi cell firing was increased above the basal level by stimulating a single inhibitory Golgi cell input at 50 Hz, suppressing the mossy fiber-evoked EPSC by 24% at 1 Hz. Furthermore, glutamate release was selectively inhibited at low-frequency mossy fiber inputs (<10 Hz) during Golgi cell stimulation. Our findings suggest that GABA spillover in the glomerulus modulates sensory input to the cerebellar cortex.
12193186	Differences in GABAergic transmission between two inputs into the perirhinal cortex.	We have investigated properties of GABAergic synaptic transmission in perirhinal cortex evoked by stimulation of temporal and entorhinal cortex sides. GABAA IPSCs were isolated by blockade of glutamatergic transmission in slices of adult perirhinal cortex; IPSC decay was best fitted with two exponentials. Interestingly, temporal IPSCs had a larger slow component of decay (P < 0.05) compared to entorhinal IPSCs. Depression of IPSCs by the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen was greater (P < 0.05) in the temporal input (79 +/- 4% depression) than the entorhinal input (65 +/- 3% depression). Furthermore, baclofen abolished the slow component of IPSC decay in both inputs. Activity-dependent depression of IPSCs at 5 Hz was greater (P < 0.05) in the temporal input [paired pulse ratio (PPR) 0.5 +/- 0.04] compared to that in the entorhinal input (PPR 0.67 +/- 0.02, n = 10). The differences in paired pulse depression between the inputs were removed by the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP55845A. This study demonstrates several differences in GABA transmission between temporal and entorhinal inputs including the differential activation of presynaptic GABAB receptors and differential regulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission. These properties may be important in the control of neuronal activity within perirhinal cortex.
7608765	Presynaptic inhibition by serotonin of glycinergic inhibitory synaptic currents in the rat brain stem.	1. With the use of a thin brain stem slice preparation, we recorded in visualized neonatal rat hypoglossal motoneurons unitary glycinergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) that were evoked by extracellular stimulation of nearby interneurons. We found that 10 microM serotonin (5-HT) presynaptically inhibited this glycinergic synaptic transmission by 85.5%. 2. In the somata of presynaptic interneurons, 5-HT1A receptor activation potentiated inwardly rectifying K+ channels and inhibited voltage-activated calcium channels. 3. In contrast, the 5-HT1B receptor was primarily responsible for inhibition of evoked glycinergic IPSCs; a selective 5-HT1B receptor agonist, N-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (TFMPP, 10 microM), inhibited synaptic transmission by 97.3%. On the other hand, 5-HT1A receptor activation by (+)-8-OH-dipropylaminotetralin (8-OHDPAT, 1 microM) inhibited IPSCs by only 24.1%. A 5-HT1A antagonist, 1-(2-methyoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)-butyl]piperazine hydrobromide (NAN-190, 1 microM), had no effect on synaptic inhibition by 5-HT. 4. In the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) as well as TTX with cadmium (50 microM), we found that 5-HT1B receptor activation by TFMPP reduced the frequency of spontaneous miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) without changing their mean amplitude. The results suggested that the 5-HT1B receptors activated at the presynaptic terminal inhibited synaptic transmission independent of inhibiting calcium influx through voltage-activated calcium channels. 5. These results indicate that activation of inwardly rectifying K+ channels and inhibition of voltage-activated calcium channels by 5-HT1A receptor activation do not constitute a main pathway for presynaptic inhibition by 5-HT of glycinergic synaptic transmission.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
7623101	Alpha-subunit of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II enhances gamma-aminobutyric acid and inhibitory synaptic responses of rat neurons in vitro.	1. Here we report that in acutely isolated rat spinal dorsal horn neurons, the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor can be regulated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-KII). Intracellularly applied, the alpha-subunit of CaM-KII enhanced GABAA-receptor-activated current recorded with the use of the whole cell patch-clamp technique. This effect was associated with reduced desensitization of GABA responses. 2. GABA-induced currents are also potentiated by calyculin A, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A. 3. Conventional intracellular recordings were made from hippocampal CA1 neurons in slices to determine the effect of intracellular application of CaM-KII on inhibitory synaptic potentials evoked by electrical stimulation of the stratum oriens/alveus. The inhibitory synaptic potential was enhanced by CaM-KII; this mechanism may contribute to long-term enhancement of inhibitory synaptic transmission and may also play a role in other forms of plasticity in the mammalian brain.
9310456	In vitro investigation of synaptic relations between interneurons surrounding the trigeminal motor nucleus and masseteric motoneurons.	Because of their many inputs and bilateral projections, interneurons surrounding the trigeminal motor nucleus (MotV) are thought to be very important in control of jaw movements and reflexes. However, their interactions with the trigeminal motoneurons are almost unknown. In the present study an in vitro slice preparation was used to investigate this relationship in rat. The zone bordering MotV has been subdivided into four regions: the supra-, juxta-, and intertrigeminal areas (SupV, JuxtV, and IntV, respectively) and the parvocellular reticular formation ventral and caudal to MotV. Stimulation of all areas evoked short-latency excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in masseteric motoneurons. Frequently the EPSPs masked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) or were followed by long-lasting inhibitory potentials. Only responses obtained from stimulation of JuxtV and IntV seemed devoid of inhibitory components. The EPSPs were mediated through kainate/alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors, whereas the IPSPs appear to be due to gamma-aminobutyric acid and glycine. EPSPs and IPSPs were also recorded in SupV premotor interneurons after stimulation of IntV and MotV, respectively, thus suggesting that reciprocal connections exist between premotor areas and also between premotor interneurons of SupV and inhibitory interneurons located within MotV. It is concluded that the preparation used here will doubtless prove useful for further investigation of the circuitry involved in the bilateral coordination of the jaw.
10854756	Functional expression of cell surface cannabinoid CB(1) receptors on presynaptic inhibitory terminals in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.	At present, little is known about the mechanisms by which cannabinoids exert their effects on the central nervous system. In this study, fluorescence imaging and electrophysiological techniques were used to investigate the functional relationship between cell surface cannabinoid type 1 (CB(1)) receptors and GABAergic synaptic transmission in cultured hippocampal neurons. CB(1) receptors were labelled on living neurons using a polyclonal antibody directed against the N-terminal 77 amino acid residues of the rat cloned CB(1) receptor. Highly punctate CB(1) receptor labelling was observed on fine axons and at axonal growth cones, with little somatic labelling. The majority of these sites were associated with synaptic terminals, identified either with immunohistochemical markers or by using the styryl dye FM1-43 to label synaptic vesicles that had undergone active turnover. Dual labelling of neurons for CB(1) receptors with either the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA or its synthesising enzyme glutamate decarboxylase, demonstrated a strong correspondence. The immunocytochemical data was supported by functional studies using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs). The cannabinoid agonist WIN55,212-2 (100nM) markedly inhibited (by 77+/-6.3%) the frequency of pharmacologically-isolated GABAergic mIPSCs. The effects of WIN55,212-2 were blocked in the presence of the selective CB(1) receptor antagonist SR141716A (100nM).In conclusion, the present data show that cell surface CB(1) receptors are expressed at presynaptic GABAergic terminals, where their activation inhibits GABA release. Their presence on growth cones could indicate a role in the targeting of inhibitory connections during development.
10869845	Somatostatin inhibits GABAergic transmission in the sensory thalamus via presynaptic receptors.	The action of somatostatin on GABA-mediated transmission was investigated in cat and rat thalamocortical neurons of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and ventrobasal thalamus in vitro. In the cat thalamus, somatostatin (10 microM) had no effect on the passive membrane properties of thalamocortical neurons and on the postsynaptic response elicited in these cells by bath or iontophoretic application of (+/-)baclofen (5-10 microM) or GABA, respectively. However, somatostatin (1-10 microM) decreased by a similar amount (45-55%) the amplitude of electrically evoked GABA(A) and GABA(B) inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in 71 and 50% of neurons in the lateral geniculate and ventrobasal nucleus, respectively. In addition, the neuropeptide abolished spontaneous bursts of GABA(A) inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in 85% of kitten lateral geniculate neurons, and decreased (40%) the amplitude of single spontaneous GABA(A) inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in 87% of neurons in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus. Similar results were obtained in the rat thalamus. Somatostatin (10 microM) had no effect on the passive membrane properties of thalamocortical neurons in this species, or on the outward current elicited by puff-application of (+/-)baclofen (5-10 microM). However, in 57 and 22% of neurons in the rat lateral geniculate and ventrobasal nuclei, respectively, somatostatin (1 microM) reduced the frequency, but not the amplitude, of miniature GABA(A) inhibitory postsynaptic currents by 31 and 37%, respectively. In addition, the neuropeptide (1 microM) decreased the amplitude of evoked GABA(A) inhibitory postsynaptic currents in 20 and 55% of rat ventrobasal neurons recorded in normal conditions and during enhanced excitability, respectively: this effect was stronger on bursts of inhibitory postsynaptic currents(100% decrease) than on single inhibitory postsynaptic currents (41% decrease). These results demonstrate that in the sensory thalamus somatostatin inhibits GABA(A)- and GABA(B)-mediated transmission via a presynaptic mechanism, and its action is more prominent on bursts of GABAergic synaptic currents/potentials.
11606644	Activation of synaptic NMDA receptors by action potential-dependent release of transmitter during hypoxia impairs recovery of synaptic transmission on reoxygenation.	Increased levels of glutamate and the subsequent activation of NMDA receptors are responsible for neuronal damage that occurs after an ischemic or hypoxic episode. In the present work, we investigated the relative contribution of presynaptic and postsynaptic blockade of synaptic transmission, as well as of blockade of NMDA receptors, for the facilitation of recovery of synaptic transmission in the CA1 area of rat hippocampal slices exposed to prolonged (90 min) hypoxia. During hypoxia, there was a complete inhibition of field EPSPs, which was fully reversible if released adenosine was allowed to act. When adenosine A(1) receptors were blocked with the selective antagonist 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX), recovery of synaptic transmission from hypoxia was significantly attenuated, and this impairment could be overcome by preventing synaptic transmission during hypoxia either with tetrodotoxin (TTX) or by switching off the afferent stimulation but not by postsynaptic blockade of transmission with 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) or selective blockade of adenosine A(2A) receptors. When synaptic transmission was allowed to occur during hypoxia, because of the presence of DPCPX, there was an NMDA receptor-mediated component of the EPSCs recorded in CA1 pyramidal neurons, and blockade of NMDA receptors with AP-5 restored recovery of synaptic transmission from hypoxia. It is concluded that impairment of recovery of synaptic transmission after an hypoxic insult results from activation of synaptic NMDA receptors by synaptically released glutamate and that adenosine by preventing this activation efficiently facilitates recovery.
12399577	The developing synapse: construction and modulation of synaptic structures and circuits.	Synapse formation and stabilization in the vertebrate central nervous system is a dynamic process, requiring bi-directional communication between pre- and postsynaptic partners. Numerous mechanisms coordinate where and when synapses are made in the developing brain. This review discusses cellular and activity-dependent mechanisms that control the development of synaptic connectivity.
14627634	Resonant synchronization in heterogeneous networks of inhibitory neurons.	Brain rhythms arise through the synchronization of neurons and their entrainment in a regular firing pattern. In this process, networks of reciprocally connected inhibitory neurons are often involved, but what mechanism determines the oscillation frequency is not completely understood. Analytical studies predict that the emerging frequency band is primarily constrained by the decay rate of the unitary IPSC. We observed a new phenomenon of resonant synchronization in computer-simulated networks of inhibitory neurons in which the synaptic current has a delayed onset, reflecting finite spike propagation and synaptic transmission times. At the resonant level of network excitation, all neurons fire synchronously and rhythmically with a period approximately four times the mean delay of the onset of the inhibitory synaptic current. The amplitude and decay time constant of the synaptic current have relatively minor effects on the emerging frequency band. By varying the axonal delay of the inhibitory connections, networks with a realistic synaptic kinetics can be tuned to frequencies from 40 to >200 Hz. This resonance phenomenon arises in heterogeneous networks with, on average, as few as five connections per neuron. We conclude that the delay of the synaptic current is the primary parameter controlling the oscillation frequency of inhibitory networks and propose that delay-induced synchronization is a mechanism for fast brain rhythms that depend on intact inhibitory synaptic transmission.
9426756	The overactive bladder: pharmacologic basis of drug treatment.	OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the basis for drug treatment of the overactive bladder. METHODS: Published information is evaluated. RESULTS: The causes of bladder overactivity are not known, but theoretically, increased afferent activity, decreased inhibitory control in the central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral ganglia, and increased sensitivity of the detrusor to efferent stimulation may be involved. Several CNS transmitters can modulate voiding, but few useful drugs with a defined CNS site of action have been developed. Drugs that stimulate gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors are used clinically. Potentially, drugs affecting opioid, 5-hydroxytryptamine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and glutamatergic receptors and mechanisms can be developed, but a selective action on the lower urinary tract may be difficult to obtain. Traditionally, drugs used for treatment of bladder overactivity have had a peripheral site of action, mainly efferent neurotransmission or the detrusor itself. Antimuscarinic drugs, beta-adrenoceptor agonists, alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists, drugs affecting membrane channels, prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, and several other agents have been used with limited success. New information on the alpha-adrenoceptor and muscarinic receptor subtypes in the human detrusor has emerged and may be the basis for the development of new compounds with effects on bladder overactivity. Decreasing afferent activity seems an attractive therapeutic approach, and drugs affecting afferent nerves by causing release of tachykinins, such as capsaicin and analogs, as well as agents blocking tachykinin receptors, may be of therapeutic interest. CONCLUSIONS: New drugs, specifically designed for the treatment of bladder overactivity, are desirable.
9451803	Localization of SH-PTP1 to synaptic vesicles: a possible role in neurotransmission.	The tyrosine kinase pp60src is known to phosphorylate synaptophysin and in doing so may regulate neurotransmitter release. The tyrosyl phosphorylated state of synaptophysin is dependent on pp60src kinase and the unknown protein tyrosine phosphate phosphohydrolase (PTPase, EC 3.1.3.48). Here we report the protein tyrosine phosphate phosphohydrolase SH-PTP1, to associate with synaptic vesicles and interact with synaptophysin. These studies identify SH-PTP1 as a new member of the secretory machinery at the nerve terminal and suggest its involvement in neurotransmission.
10433501	Cannabinoid receptor activation inhibits GABAergic neurotransmission in rostral ventromedial medulla neurons in vitro.	1. The rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) is thought to play a crucial role in the antinociceptive actions of cannabinoids. This study examined the actions of the cannabinoid receptor agonist, WIN55,212-2, on membrane properties and GABAergic synaptic transmission in RVM neurons using whole cell patch clamp recordings in brain slices. 2. WIN55,212-2 (3 microM) had no effect on membrane K+ conductance of primary or secondary RVM neurons. Primary neurons responded to the kappa-opioid receptor agonist U69,593 (300 nM - 1 microM). Secondary neurons responded to the mu,delta-opioid receptor agonist met-enkephalin (10 microM). 3. WIN55,212-2 reduced the amplitude of electrically evoked (GABAergic) inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in all neurons (58%, pEC50=6.2+/-0.1). The inhibition was reversed by the CB1 receptor selective antagonist, SR141716 (3 microM). WIN55,212-2 also produced relative facilitation of the second IPSC to paired evoked IPSCs. 4. WIN55,212-2 and met-enkephalin reduced the rate of spontaneous miniature IPSCs in all cells (44 and 53%), but had no effect on their amplitude distributions or kinetics. 5. These results suggest that the antinociceptive actions of cannabinoids within RVM are primarily due to presynaptic inhibition of GABAergic neurotransmission. The neuronal substrates of cannabinoid actions in RVM therefore differ from those of opioids, which have both pre- and postsynaptic inhibitory actions.
10677277	A fragment of recombinant GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit forming rosette-like homo-oligomers.	The type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor plays a major role in inhibitory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. A fragment consisting of residues Cys166 to Leu296 of the alpha1 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and was found to have stable beta-rich structures. Here, results from laser scattering, gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy demonstrated that this recombinant protein formed rosette-like homo-oligomers, mainly pentamers in solution. Therefore, the fragment apparently provides a valuable model system for studying the pentameric holoreceptor assembly. Non-reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the fragment showed that disulfide bonds formed between monomers contributed to the oligomerization of the fragment. The fact that this fragment alone could form pentamers in vitro strongly suggests that amino acid residues located within the Cys166-Leu296 region of the alpha1 subunit may contribute to the oligomerization of GABA(A) receptor in vivo.
10937999	Calcium sensitivity of glutamate release in a calyx-type terminal.	Synaptic efficacy critically depends on the presynaptic intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). We measured the calcium sensitivity of glutamate release in a rat auditory brainstem synapse by laser photolysis of caged calcium. A rise in [Ca2+]i to 1 micromolar readily evoked release. An increase to >30 micromolar depleted the releasable vesicle pool in <0.5 millisecond. A comparison with action potential-evoked release suggested that a brief increase of [Ca2+]i to approximately 10 micromolar would be sufficient to reproduce the physiological release pattern. Thus, the calcium sensitivity of release at this synapse is high, and the distinction between phasic and delayed release is less pronounced than previously thought.
11553685	Distinct signal transduction pathways for GABA-induced GABA(A) receptor down-regulation and uncoupling in neuronal culture: a role for voltage-gated calcium channels.	Changes in GABA receptor (GABA(A)R) gene expression are detected in animal models of epilepsy, anxiety and in post-mortem schizophrenic brain, suggesting a role for GABA(A)R regulation in neurological disorders. Persistent (48 h) exposure of brain neurons in culture to GABA results in down-regulation of GABA(A)R number and uncoupling of GABA and benzodiazepine (BZD) binding sites. Given the central role of GABA(A)Rs in fast inhibitory synaptic transmission, GABA(A)R down-regulation and uncoupling are potentially important mechanisms of regulating neuronal excitability, yet the molecular mechanisms remain unknown. In this report we show that treatment of brain neurons in culture with tetrodotoxin, glutamate receptor antagonists, or depolarization with 25 mM K(+) fails to alter GABA(A)R number or coupling. Changes in neuronal activity or membrane potential are therefore not sufficient to induce either GABA(A)R down-regulation or uncoupling. Nifedipine, a voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel (VGCC) blocker, inhibits both GABA-induced increases in [Ca(2+)](i) and GABA(A)R down-regulation, suggesting that VGCC activation is required for GABA(A)R down-regulation. Depolarization with 25 mM K(+) produces a sustained increase in intracellular [Ca(2+)] without causing GABA(A)R down-regulation, suggesting that activation of VGCCs is not sufficient to produce GABA(A)R down-regulation. In contrast to GABA(A)R down-regulation, nifedipine and 25 mM K(+) fail to inhibit GABA-induced uncoupling, demonstrating that GABA-induced GABA(A)R down-regulation and uncoupling are mediated by independent molecular events. Therefore, GABA(A)R activation initiates at least two distinct signal transduction pathways, one of which involves elevation of intracellular [Ca(2+)] through VGCCs.
12661937	Molecular biology and ontogeny of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in the mammalian central nervous system.	gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. After release from nerve terminals, GABA binds to at least two classes of postsynaptic receptors (ie, GABAA and GABAB), which are nearly ubiquitous in the brain. GABAA receptors are postsynaptic heteropentameric complexes that display unique physiologic and pharmacologic properties based on subunit composition. Activation of GABAA receptors in mature neurons results in membrane hyperpolarization, which is mediated principally by inward chloride flux, whereas in early stages of brain development, GABAA receptor activation causes depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. GABA, receptors reside both presynaptically and postsynaptically, exist as heterodimers and are coupled to voltage-dependent ion channels through interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins. This review summarizes the molecular biology and ontogeny of GABAA and GABAB receptors, highlighting some of their putative roles during normal brain development as well as in disease states such as epilepsy.
12746884	Production of interferon-beta by fibroblast cells on membranes prepared with RGD-containing peptides.	The production of interferon-beta by NB1-RGB fibroblast cells cultured on protein and peptide membranes prepared from silk fibroin, motif peptides of silk fibroin [(AG)(n)] containing arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide, and Pronectin was investigated. The cell density on various protein and peptide membranes was approximately the same, although the production of interferon-beta depended significantly on the membranes where the cells were cultured. The highest production of interferon-beta was observed when the cells were cultured on (AG)(6)RGD(AG)(7) membranes prepared with hexafluoroacetone (HFA) as the casting solvent. On RGD-containing peptide membranes more centrally located in the peptides, the cells produced more interferon-beta when the peptide membranes were prepared with HFA as the casting solvent. However, there was no enhanced production of interferon-beta by cells on (AG)(6)RGD(AG)(7) membranes prepared with 9 mol/L LiBr or 4.5 mol/L LiClO(4) solution as the casting solvent. Therefore, both the chemical composition and the secondary and higher order structure of the peptide membranes are important for enhanced production of interferon-beta. The blocking of integrin beta(1) on the cells by anti-integrin beta(1) antibody prevented the enhanced production of interferon-beta on (AG)(6)RGD(AG)(7) membranes prepared with HFA. We suggest that the cells must bind to the RGD sequence having the appropriate conformation through their integrin beta(1) for enhanced production of interferon-beta.
12925001	Pre- and postsynaptic contribution of GABAC receptors to GABAergic synaptic transmission in rat collicular slices and cultures.	The mammalian superior colliculus (SC) is reported to contain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)C receptors (GABACRs) at high concentration. However, their role in GABAergic synaptic transmission is not yet known. The aim of the present study was: (i) to clarify whether GABACRs are activated by endogenous GABA; and (ii), to determine whether GABACRs play a role in inhibitory synaptic transmission. Experiments were performed on acute horizontal slices from the postnatal rat SC or on collicular neurons in dissociated cell culture. In both preparations, bicuculline-resistant current responses to exogenous GABA and currents elicited by cis-4-aminocrotonic acid (CACA) were blocked by (1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine-4-yl) methylphosphinic acid (TPMPA), a GABACR antagonist. The CACA-induced currents exhibited a linear current-voltage relationship and reversed at the Cl- equilibrium potential. These results indicate that functional GABACRs are present in the somato-dendritic membrane of collicular neurons. Miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were recorded using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. TPMPA significantly decreased mIPSC amplitudes in slices, but not in cultured neurons. As TPMPA decreased also the coefficient of variation of mIPSCs, we suggest that somatodendritic GABACRs are located extrasynaptically but can be involved in the generation of IPSCs if GABA diffusion is constrained. In cultures, individual connections were activated by focal electrical stimulation of single neurons, and evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) were recorded. Paired-pulse stimulation revealed that TPMPA significantly decreased the paired-pulse ratio at short (50 ms) interstimulus intervals, and this effect was inversely dependent on the amplitude of the first eIPSC. We conclude that presynaptic GABACRs are activated by endogenous GABA and can alleviate the short-term depression resulting from a preceding episode of GABA release. Thus, in GABAergic synapses of the SC GABACRs are involved in pre- and postsynaptic functions and may therefore contribute to the activity-dependent adjustment of GABAergic inhibition.
12702707	Differential effects of ethanol on GABA(A) and glycine receptor-mediated synaptic currents in brain stem motoneurons.	Ethanol potentiates glycinergic synaptic transmission to hypoglossal motoneurons (HMs). This effect on glycinergic transmission changes with postnatal development in that juvenile HMs (P9-13) are more sensitive to ethanol than neonate HMs (P1-3). We have now extended our previous study to investigate ethanol modulation of synaptic GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs), because both GABA and glycine mediate inhibitory synaptic transmission to brain stem motoneurons. We tested the effects of ethanol on GABAergic and glycinergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) recorded from neonate and juvenile rat HMs in an in vitro slice preparation. Bath application of 30 mM ethanol had no significant effect on the GABAergic mIPSC amplitude or frequency recorded at either age. At 100 mM, ethanol significantly decreased the GABAergic mIPSC amplitude recorded from neonate (6 +/- 3%, P < 0.05) and juvenile (16 +/- 3%, P < 0.01) HMs. The same concentration of ethanol increased the GABAergic mIPSC frequency recorded from neonate (64 +/- 17%, P < 0.05) and juvenile (40 +/- 15%, n.s.) HMs. In contrast, 100 mM ethanol robustly potentiated glycinergic mIPSC amplitude in neonate (31 +/- 3%, P < 0.0001) and juvenile (41 +/- 7%, P < 0.001) HMs. These results suggest that glycine receptors are more sensitive to modulation by ethanol than GABA(A) receptors and that 100 mM ethanol has the opposite effect on GABA(A)R-mediated currents in juvenile HMs, that is, inhibition rather than enhancement. Further, comparing ethanol's effects on GABAergic mIPSC amplitude and frequency, ethanol modulates GABAergic synaptic transmission to HMs differentially. Presynaptically, ethanol enhances mIPSC frequency while postsynaptically it decreases mIPSC amplitude.
12818177	Control of synaptic strength, a novel function of Akt.	Akt (also known as PKB), a serine/threonine kinase involved in diverse signal-transduction pathways, is highly expressed in the brain. Akt is known to have a strong antiapoptotic action and thereby to be critically involved in neuronal survival, but its potential role in the dynamic modulation of synaptic transmission is unknown. Here we report that Akt phosphorylates, both in vitro and in vivo, the type A gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA(A)R), the principal receptor mediating fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in the mammalian brain. Akt-mediated phosphorylation increases the number of GABA(A)Rs on the plasma membrane surface, thereby increasing the receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in neurons. These results identify the GABA(A)R as a novel substrate of Akt, thereby linking Akt to the regulation of synaptic strength. This work also provides evidence for the rapid regulation of neurotransmitter receptor numbers in the postsynaptic domain by direct receptor phosphorylation as an important means of producing synaptic plasticity.
7560905	Synapses of optic axons with GABA- and glutamate-containing elements in the optic tectum of Bufo marinus.	The central termination and the transmitter content of the optic fibers and the neurochemical nature of their synaptic targets was investigated in the optic tectum of the toad Bufo marinus. Retinal ganglion cells were retrogradely filled from the tectum with the fluorescent dye DiI and the retinal wholemounts were immunostained for glutamate. Most of the dye-filled cells could be double labeled. In addition, double-labeling for gamma-aminobutyric acid an glutamate were also made, when colocalization of these markers was not observed in the neurons of the retinal ganglion cell layer. In order to identify retinal terminals in the optic tectum, optic axons were retrogradely filled with horseradish peroxidase. Postembedding immunocytochemistry showed that 88% of the optic axon terminals were glutamate-like immunoreactive, 6% gamma-aminobutyric acid-immunoreactive and 6% were negative for both GABA and glutamate. Optic fibre terminals synapsed on gamma-aminobutyric acid- or glutamate-containing postsynaptic profiles (58% and 7%, respectively), while the rest on immunonegative elements. Optic fibres containing glutamate rarely synapsed with glutamate-like immunoreactive postsynaptic elements. In contrast, 67% of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-immunoreactive optic terminals synapsed onto gamma-aminobutyric acid-positive dendrites. It has been observed after combination of anterograde tracer transport and double-label immunocytochemistry, that 57% of the optic terminals synapsed on gamma-aminobutyric acid-immunoreactive elements and 38% on dendrites containing neither gamma-aminobutyric acid- nor glutamate-immunoreactive materials. These results suggest that (1) a large number of ganglion cells use glutamate and some gamma-aminobutyric acid as a transmitter, (2) a substantial proportion of the optic axons terminate on gamma-aminobutyric acid-containing inhibitory interneurons in the tectum, (3) some intrinsic neurons in the tectum are glutamate-like immunoreactive. We also propose, that (4) gamma-aminobutyric acid-immunoreactive optic axons may form an effective disinhibitory circuit in the tectum by synapsing preferentially with local inhibitory interneurons.
7906023	Role of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in synchronized discharges of hilar neurons in guinea pig hippocampal slices.	The role of glutamatergic excitatory synaptic transmission in the synchronization of burst discharges in hilar neurons was studied using paired intracellular recording from hilar neurons and granule cells of guinea pig hippocampal slices. The convulsant 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 50-100 microM) induced synchronous burst discharges in hilar neurons time locked to giant inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in granule cells. The non-N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (non-NMDA) receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 5-10 microM) disrupted this synchrony. The inhibitory effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)B receptor stimulation on the frequency of synchronous activity was smaller in the presence of CNQX than in its absence. We conclude that glutamatergic synapses operating through non-NMDA receptors are required for the synchronization but not for the generation of burst discharges which are induced by 4-AP in hilar neurons.
8800380	Acamprosate (calcium acetylhomotaurinate) enhances the N-methyl-D-aspartate component of excitatory neurotransmission in rat hippocampal CA1 neurons in vitro.	The taurinate analog acamprosate (calcium acetylhomotaurinate) has received considerable attention in Europe for its ability to prevent relapse in abstained alcoholics. To determine the mechanism of acamprosate actions in the CNS, we superfused acamprosate onto rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons using an in vitro slice preparation. In current-and voltage-clamp recordings, acamprosate (100 to 100 microM) superfusion had little effect on resting membrane potential or input slope resistance. Acamprosate had no effect on Ca(2+)-dependent action potentials when tetrodotoxin was used to block Na+ spikes. In whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, and in the presence of tetraethylammonium and Cs+ to block K+ channels, acamprosate had little effect on a Cd(2+)-sensitive inward current likely to be a high voltage-activated Ca2+ current. However, in both current- and voltage-clamp recordings, acamprosate significantly increased the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) component of excitatory postsynaptic potentials evoked by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals in the stratum radiatum, in the presence of the selective non-NMDA (R,S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid kainate) glutamate receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione and the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline. Acamprosate had inconsistent or no effects on the stratum radiatum-evoked non-NMDA component of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials, in the presence of bicuculline and the NMDA antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate. Acamprosate, on average, had little effect on the late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials thought to be mediated by GABAB receptors. In the presence of tetrodotoxin to block synaptic transmission, acamprosate dramatically increased inward current responses in most CA1 neurons to exogenous NMDA applied by pressure or superfusion, with reversal on washout of acamprosate. These data suggest that acamprosate may act postsynaptically to increase the NMDA component of excitatory transmission to hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Considering the known interaction of ethanol with NMDA receptors, this acamprosate modulation of NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission could provide a mechanism of action underlying the clinical efficacy of acamprosate.
9777643	Physiological functions of GABA-induced depolarizations in the developing rat spinal cord.	Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is one of the principle inhibitory neurotransmitters in the mature spinal cord. It effectively suppresses synaptic transmission by mechanisms of postsynaptic and presynaptic inhibition. The function of GABA is less well understood early in spinal cord development, when the amino acid is transiently expressed in most neurons, and it depolarizes instead of hyperpolarizes neurons. This article reviews the possible physiological roles of GABA in modulating synaptic transmission, promoting neuronal development, and regulating neuronal pH during early stages of spinal cord differentiation. It is proposed that despite its depolarizing action, GABA acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter that may also function as a neurotrophic agent.
12370408	Reciprocal developmental regulation of presynaptic ionotropic receptors.	Activation of ionotropic glycine receptors potentiates glutamate release in mature calyceal nerve terminals of the rat medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, an auditory brainstem nucleus. In young rats, glycine and its receptors are poorly expressed. We therefore asked whether GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) might play a larger role than glycine in the regulation of glutamate release in the absence of glycine receptors. Indeed, in rats younger than postnatal day 11 (P11), and before the onset of hearing, calyces expressed high levels of ionotropic GABA(A) receptors but few glycine receptors. Isoguvacine, a selective agonist at GABA(A) receptors, strongly enhanced excitatory postsynaptic currents in young rats but had little effect in rats older than P11. Down-regulation of presynaptic GABA(A) receptors did not reflect global changes in receptor expression, because the magnitude of GABA and glycine responses was similar at P13 in the parent-cell bodies of the calyces, the bushy cells of the cochlear nucleus. In outside-out patches excised from the nonsynaptic face of calyces, GABA and glycine evoked single-channel currents consistent with the properties of postsynaptic GABA(A) and glycine receptors. Inhibitory GABA(B) receptors were present on the calyx at all developmental stages examined. Thus, GABA initially acts on two receptor subtypes, both promoting and inhibiting glutamate release. With age, the former role is transferred to the glycine receptor during the period in which postsynaptic glycinergic transmission is acquired.
10660891	Evidence for coexistence of enkephalin and glutamate in axon terminals and cellular sites for functional interactions of their receptors in the rat locus coeruleus.	The authors previously showed that a subset of axon terminals in the locus coeruleus (LC) contains methionine5-enkephalin (ENK) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) immunoreactivities. However, numerous ENK-labeled terminals lacked GABA and exhibited synaptic specializations that were characteristic of excitatory-type transmitters. To determine whether ENK coexists with glutamate in the LC, preembedding immunoperoxidase detection of ENK or immunogold-silver was combined with postembedding identification of glutamate using a gold marker. Indeed, 28% of the ENK-labeled axon terminals examined (n = 250 axon terminals) also contained glutamate. To define further sites for functional interactions between opiate ligands and excitatory amino acid receptors, the ultrastructural localization of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) was examined with respect to either the kainate receptor (KAR) or the R1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NR1)-type glutamate receptor in the LC. Gold-silver labeling for MOR and peroxidase labeling for either KAR or NR1 indicated that the MOR often was localized to the plasma membrane of dendrites that also exhibited immunolabeling for either glutamate receptor subtype. In contrast to the KAR, which was identified primarily in somata and dendrites, NR1 immunoreactivity also was found frequently in axon terminals as well as in glial processes. Glial processes containing NR1 occasionally exhibited immunolabeling for MOR and sometimes were directly apposed to MOR-containing dendrites in the LC. Furthermore, NR1-labeled receptors in axon terminals sometimes were presynaptic to MOR-labeled dendrites. The authors concluded that ENK and glutamate may be cotransmitters in LC afferents. Moreover, ligands at the KAR may modulate directly MOR-containing neurons in the LC, whereas actions at NR1 receptors may affect opioid-sensitive neurons through multiple cellular mechanisms, i.e., through presynaptic, postsynaptic, or glial actions.
14636780	Functional roles and therapeutic targeting of gelatinase B and chemokines in multiple sclerosis.	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the CNS of unknown cause. Pathogenetic mechanisms, such as chemotaxis, subsequent activation of autoreactive lymphocytes, and skewing of the extracellular proteinase balance, are targets for new therapies. Matrix metalloproteinase gelatinase B (MMP-9) is upregulated in MS and was recently shown to degrade interferon beta, one of the drugs used to treat MS. Consequently, the effect of endogenously produced interferon beta or parenterally given interferon beta may be increased by gelatinase B inhibitors. Blockage of chemotaxis or cell adhesion molecule engagement, and inhibition of hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase to lower expression of gelatinase B, may become effective treatments of MS, alone or in combination with interferon beta. This may allow interferon beta to be used at lower doses and prevent side-effects.
9684157	Production of gamma-aminobutyric acid by cheese starters during cheese ripening.	Nine mixed-strain starters were examined for their abilities to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid. Six commercial starters were found to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid in a skim milk culture. The bacterium that produced gamma-aminobutyric acid was isolated from the mixed-strain starters, identified as citrate-utilizing Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (formerly L. lactis ssp. lactis biovar diacetylactis) and designated as strain 01-7. A cell extract showed glutamate decarboxylase activity, for which the optimum pH was 4.7. In pH-controlled cultivation, gamma-aminobutyric acid was generated at pH 5.0 but not above pH 5.5. Cheeses were prepared experimentally using strain 01-7 to determine the relationship between the pH values and the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid during cheese ripening. gamma-Aminobutyric acid increased linearly in the experimental cheeses as the pH of the cheese decreased. Based on these results, gamma-aminobutyric acid was concluded to be produced by the cheese starters during ripening.
10204677	Effects of ginseng saponins on responses induced by various receptor stimuli.	We investigated the effects of four ginseng saponins, ginsenoside-Rb1, -Rg2, -Rg3 and -Ro, on the responses induced by receptor stimulation of various stimuli. Ginsenoside-Rg2 (1-100 microM) reduced the secretions of catecholamines from bovine adrenal chromaffin cells stimulated by acetylcholine and gamma-aminobutyric acid but not by angiotensin II, bradykinin, histamine and neurotensin. In guinea-pig, the ginsenoside also diminished the nicotine-induced secretion of catecholamines from the adrenal chromaffin cells, but it did not affect the muscarine- and the histamine-induced ileum contractions. On the other hand, ginsenoside-Rg3 (1-100 microM) reduced not only the acetylcholine-, the gamma-aminobutyric acid- and the neurotensin-induced secretions but also, at a higher concentration (100 microM), the angiotensin II-, the bradykinin- and the histamine-induced secretions from the bovine chromaffin cells. Furthermore, the saponin (3-100 microM) significantly inhibited the muscarine- and the histamine-induced ileum contractions of the guinea-pig. Ginsenoside-Rb1 and -Ro had no marked effect on their responses. These results strongly suggest that ginsenoside-Rg2 is a potent selective blocker of nicotinic acetylcholine and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors (ionotropic receptors) and ginsenoside-Rg3 is not only a blocker of ionotropic receptors but also an antagonist of muscarinic or histamine receptors.
8023478	[Therapeutic use of interferon beta].	All types of interferon (alpha, beta, gamma) have a virostatic immunomodulating and antiproliferative effect. There are, however, quantitative differences between different interferons as regards the mentioned properties. Interferon beta has a marked antiviral action, and therefore it is used in a dose of 0.5 x 10(6) IU/kg in long-term infusions in life-endangering viral infections. Interferon beta differs from interferon alpha by a higher lipophilia and thus greater tissue affinity. It is therefore useful for local treatment. Local administration is used in severe infections of the anterior segment of the eye and in relapses of condyloma accuminatum and in warts. In oncology intra- and peritumourous administration is used which in the great majority of patients leads to a time-limited remission of metastases in soft tissues as well as in bones. Intrathecal interferon beta administration retarded in s minor group of patients the course of multiple sclerosis.
8558234	Synapse formation and establishment of neuronal polarity by P19 embryonic carcinoma cells and embryonic stem cells.	A number of different cell lines that exhibit a partial neuronal phenotype have been identified, but in many cases the full extent of their neuronal differentiation has not been directly addressed by functional studies. We have used electrophysiology and immunofluorescence to examine the formation of synapses and the development of neuronal polarity by murine embryonic stem (ES) cells and the mouse P19 embryonic carcinoma cell line. Within 2-3 weeks after induction by retinoic acid, subsets of P19 and ES cells formed excitatory synapses, mediated by glutamate receptors, or inhibitory synapses, mediated by receptors for GABA or glycine. In ES-cell cultures, both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors contributed to the excitatory postsynaptic response. Staining with antibodies to growth-associated protein-43 and microtubule-associated protein-2 revealed segregation of immunoreactivity into separate axonal and somato-dendritic compartments, respectively. Consistent with our physiological evidence for synapse formation, intense punctate staining was observed with antibodies to the synaptic vesicle proteins synapsin, SV2, and synaptophysin. These results demonstrate the in vitro acquisition by pluri-potent cell lines of neuronal polarity and functional synaptic transmission that is characteristic of CNS neurons.
10718911	GABAA receptor mediated elevation of Ca2+ and modulation of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone action in alphaT3-1 gonadotropes.	gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, mediating fast inhibitory synaptic transmission, by activating GABAA receptors. However, these GABA-gated Cl- channels can also be excitatory, causing depolarization, and increasing Ca2+ entry via voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (VOCCs). Evidence exists for excitatory ionotropic GABA receptors in anterior pituitary cells, including gonadotropes, but these have not been directly characterized and their pharmacology remains controversial. Here we have measured the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in alphaT3-1 gonadotropes, to test for expression of excitatory GABA receptors. The GABAA agonists, GABA and muscimol, both caused rapid, robust and dose-dependent increases in [Ca2+]i (EC50 values 2.7 and 1 microM), whereas the GABAB agonist, baclofen, did not. The GABAA antagonist, bicuculline, inhibited muscimol's effect, whereas the GABAB antagonist, phaclofen, did not. The neuroactive steroid 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-11,20-dione (an allosteric activator of GABAA receptors) increased [Ca2+]i, and this effect, like that of muscimol, was inhibited by picrotoxin. The muscimol effect on [Ca2+]i was blocked by the VOCC antagonist, nifedipine, or by Ca2+-free medium. When cells were pretreated with muscimol this increased the spike phase of the [Ca2+]i response to subsequent stimulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Similar amplification was seen in muscimol-pretreated cells stimulated with GnRH in Ca2+-free medium, but not when cells were pretreated with muscimol in Ca2+-free medium. The amplification was not, however, GnRH receptor-specific, because the spike response to ionomycin was also increased by muscimol pretreatment. These data provide the first direct evidence for expression of excitatory GABAA receptors, and the first demonstration of acute steroid effects, on GnRH-responsive pituitary cells. They also reveal a novel mechanism by which GABAA activation modulates GnRH action, raising the possibility that this may also influence gonadotrophin secretion from non-immortalized gonadotropes.
12163512	Postsynaptic action of BDNF on GABAergic synaptic transmission in the superficial layers of the mouse superior colliculus.	The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in numerous aspects of synapse development and plasticity. The present study was aimed at clarifying the significance of endogenous BDNF for the synaptically driven spontaneous network activity and GABAergic inhibition in the superficial layers of the mouse superior colliculus. In this structure neuron survival is unaffected by the absence of BDNF. Two experimental approaches were used: comparison of BDNF-deficient (-/-) and wild-type (+/+) mice and blockade of BDNF receptor signaling by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor K-252a. Patch-clamp recordings were performed on horizontal slices during postnatal days 15 and 16. The lack of BDNF in -/- mice caused a significant reduction of the spontaneous action potential frequency and an increase in the pharmacologically induced disinhibition of spike discharge. This change was accompanied by an increase in the amplitudes of GABAergic evoked, spontaneous, and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). BDNF gene inactivation had no effect on the degree of paired-pulse facilitation or the frequency of miniature IPSCs. The increase of IPSC amplitudes by chronic BDNF deprivation was completely mimicked by acute exposure to K-252a in +/+ animals. The enhancement of GABAergic IPSCs in -/- animals was reversed by acute application of 100 ng/ml BDNF, but this rescue was completely prevented by blocking postsynaptic protein kinase C (PKC) activation with the PKC inhibitor peptide 19-31. From these results we conclude that BDNF increases spontaneous network activity by suppressing GABAergic inhibition, the site of action of BDNF is predominantly postsynaptic, BDNF-induced suppression of GABAergic synaptic transmission is caused by acute downregulation of GABA(A) receptors, and BDNF effects are mediated by its TrkB receptor and require PKC activation in the postsynaptic cell.
12482942	Differential modulation of synaptic transmission by neuropeptide Y in rat neocortical neurons.	Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is widely expressed throughout the nervous system and is known to reduce excitatory (but also inhibitory) synaptic transmission in many CNS areas, leading to the proposal that it is an endogenous antiepileptic agent. In the neocortex, where NPY is present in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons, its effects on inhibitory and excitatory synaptic activities have not been completely explored. Here we report that NPY application elicits a long-lasting decrease in evoked excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude and a delayed, long-lasting increase in the amplitude of evoked monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) in layer V pyramidal neurons of rat neocortex. The novel, late, NPY-mediated increase of inhibitory synaptic transmission is caused by modulation of Ca2+-dependent GABA release onto pyramidal neurons, as it was accompanied by an increase in Ca2+-dependent miniature IPSC frequency. NPY decreased evoked monosynaptic IPSCs in GABAergic interneurons, indicating that this neuropeptide has differential effects on different neuronal subtypes in the neocortex. Each of these NPY actions would decrease excitability in cortical circuits, a result that has important implications for both physiological neocortical operations as well as pathophysiological epileptiform activities.
12606680	In vivo pain-inhibitory role of nociceptin/orphanin FQ in spinal cord.	Because nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) has both pronociceptive (hyperalgesia) and antinociceptive actions in pharmacological experiments, and there is no significant difference in the nociceptive responses between NOP(-/-) mice and their wild-type (NOP(+/+)) littermates, the physiological role of N/OFQ in pain regulation remains to be determined. Under the hypothesis that the use of molecularly distinct nociception test may reveal the pain modality-specific role of N/OFQ, we attempted to examine the physiological role of N/OFQ in pain transmission by using newly developed algogenic-induced nociceptive flexion test in NOP(-/-) and NOP(+/+) mice or NOP antagonist-treated mice. The nociceptive flexor responses upon intraplantar injection of bradykinin or substance P, which stimulates polymodal substance P-ergic fibers, were markedly potentiated in NOP(-/-) mice, compared with those in its NOP(+/+) mice. However, there were no significant changes in NOP(-/-) mice with adenosine triphosphate or prostaglandin I(2) agonist, which stimulates glutamatergic but not substance P-ergic fibers. The nocifensive responses induced by substance P (i.t.) were also potentiated in NOP(-/-) mice. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in NK1-like immunoreactivity, [(3)H]substance P binding, or NK1 gene expression in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord between NOP(-/-) and NOP(+/+) mice. In addition, NOP antagonists decreased the threshold in nociception tests driving spinal substance P neurotransmission. All these findings suggest that the N/OFQ-ergic neuron may play an in vivo inhibitory role on the second-order neurons for primary polymodal substance P-ergic fibers in the spinal cord.
7966635	Multicycle infection of hepatitis C virus in cell culture and inhibition by alpha and beta interferons.	We previously reported that a clone of a human lymphocytic cell line, HPBMa clone 10-2, supports the genome replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV). In the present study, the multicycle transmission of HCV from infected cells to new cells was demonstrated by coculture with drug-resistant cells as recipients; i.e., the system was proved productive for infectious HCV. Inhibition of viral replication by alpha and beta interferons was observed.
9036986	Regulation of IFN-alpha/beta, MxA, 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase, and HLA gene expression in influenza A-infected human lung epithelial cells.	The epithelial cells of the respiratory tract are the primary sites of virus replication in influenza A virus infections. We infected human alveolar epithelium-like A549 cells and fibroblast-like human fetal lung (HFL1) cells with a pathogenic influenza A virus (A/Beijing/353/89), and studied the kinetics of infection and the expression of host IFN-alpha/beta, MxA, OAS (2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase), and HLA class I and II genes. Viral mRNA and protein synthesis was clearly seen in virus-infected lung cells. A549 and HFL1 cells produced only small amounts of IFN-alpha/beta, whereas virus-infected macrophages produced type I IFN very efficiently. The kinetics of IFN-beta gene expression in A549 cells was rapid, as shown by reverse-transcriptase PCR, and IFN-beta mRNA expression levels correlated well to the kinetics of nuclear factor-kappa B transcription factor activation. In influenza A virus-infected A549 and HFL1 cells, MxA gene induction was mediated by IFN-alpha/beta released into the cell culture supernatant, and was prevented by anti-type I IFN Abs. HLA class I Ag expression, which could be activated by IFN in noninfected A549 and HFL1 cells, was not induced in these cells by virus infection. The results suggest that type I IFN are essential for the activation of the antiviral response in lung epithelial cells.
9243372	Neutralization of endogenous interferon-beta increases the efficiency of adenoviral vector-mediated gene transduction.	One reason for low transduction efficiency and, hence, the inefficiency of gene therapy using adenoviral vectors may be the natural antiviral defense mechanisms of hosts. In this study, we investigated the effects of endogenous interferon-beta (IFN-beta) on gene transduction by adenoviral vectors. Infection of murine macrophages with Ad5CMV-LacZ produced increased expression of endogenous IFN-beta. Neutralization with anti-IFN-beta antibody (but not control immunoglobulin) during infection with the vector enhanced expression of LacZ. In contrast, IFN-beta gene expression was not detected in readily transduced NIH 3T3 cells, and the transduction efficiency of NIH 3T3 cells was unaffected by the antibody. LacZ gene expression in NIH 3T3 cells was decreased when cocultured with macrophages or in the presence of exogenous IFN-beta. The addition of the anti-IFN-beta antibody reversed this inhibition. These results demonstrate that IFN-beta-mediated cellular antiviral mechanisms are a barrier to gene transduction by adenoviral vectors.
9782314	Coronavirus MHV-A59 causes upregulation of interferon-beta RNA in primary glial cell cultures.	Infection of mice with coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain MHV-A59 causes focal acute encephalitis, hepatitis and chronic demyelinating disease. To investigate host interferon (IFN) response to viral infection within the brain, RNA was extracted from A59-or MHV-2- infected and mock-infected primary astrocyte cultures from newborn mice, RT-PCR amplified RNA with primers specific for the various IFNs, transferred to nylon membranes and hybridized with IFN specific digoxigenin-labeled probes. Infection of primary astrocyte cultures from newborn mice with either A59 or MHV-2 caused upregulation of IFN-beta RNA, but not IFN-gamma or IFN-alpha. Thus, brain astrocytes are capable of producing a local IFN-beta response upon infection with MHV. The response of the other IFNs following MHV infection may be derived from inflammatory cells.
10024886	Virus infection leads to localized hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the IFN-beta promoter.	Transcriptional activation of the human interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene by virus infection requires the assembly of a higher order nucleoprotein complex, the enhanceosome, which consists of the transcriptional activators NF-kappa B (p50/p65), ATF-2/c-jun, IRF-3 and IRF-7, architectural protein HMGI(Y), and the coactivators p300 and CBP. In this report, we show that virus infection of cells results in a dramatic hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 that is localized to the IFN-beta promoter. Furthermore, expressing a truncated version of IRF-3, which lacks a p300/CBP interaction domain, suppresses both histone hyperacetylation and activation of the IFN-beta gene. Thus, coactivator-mediated localized hyperacetylation of histones may play a crucial role in inducible gene expression.
10321980	A mechanism for selective induction of 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase, anti-viral state, but not MHC class I genes by interferon-beta in neurons.	Interferon-inducible expression of major histocompatibility class I genes has previously been found to be quantitatively and functionally deficient in neurons compared to other somatic cells or other neural cell types including astrocytes. This deficiency is a key component of neuronal immunoprivilege during viral infections of the CNS. To the contrary, in the present study, induction of functional antiviral state by IFN-beta in neurons compared to astrocytes was found to be highly efficient with respect to both viral replication and protection from cytopathic effects. A candidate antiviral state gene found to be efficiently induced in neurons by IFN-beta was the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) gene. Unlike MHC class I genes, induction of OAS was comparable in neurons and astrocytes indicating differential expression in these neural cell types. Analysis of OAS gene promoter activity indicated that induction of the OAS gene by IFN-beta was dependent on a region containing the interferon stimulated responsive element (ISRE). In contrast, a construct containing the MHC class I-ISRE responsible for induction by IFN-beta in astrocytes was not responsive to IFN-beta in neurons. Therefore, transcription factor binding to the OAS- and MHC-ISREs was analyzed. While the OAS and MHC Class I site bound equal amounts of the transcriptional repressor IRF-2, the OAS-ISRE preferentially interacted with the transcriptional activator ISGF3 in response to IFN-beta. Further, unlike neurons, upregulation of MHC class I genes in astrocytes was related to binding of IRF-1 instead of IRF-2 to the MHC-ISRE. It is proposed that selective activation of anti-viral state genes compared to MHC class I genes by IFN-beta in neurons is mediated by preferential induction and binding of ISGF3 to anti-viral state gene ISREs but not the MHC-ISRE.
10329542	HTLV-I-infected T cells evade the antiproliferative action of IFN-beta.	Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-infected T-cell clones enter the S-phase of the cell cycle in the absence of exogenous IL-2. The pathway by which HTLV-I activates the host T cell may circumvent normal immunoregulatory mechanisms and thus be important for the pathogenesis of HTLV-I-induced diseases. The early control of viral infections is in part mediated by interferons (IFNs), which possess both antiviral and antiproliferative functions. In order to investigate the antiproliferative effect of IFN-beta on HTLV-I-induced T-cell activation, we generated T-cell clones from patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis by single-cell cloning under limiting dilution conditions. Here we demonstrate that HTLV-I-induced T-cell proliferation is resistant to the antiproliferative action of IFN-beta. Moreover, HTLV-I-infected T-cell clones continue to constitutively secrete IFN-gamma in the presence of high doses of IFN-beta. HTLV-I-infected T cells express normal levels of IFNAR1 and are able to respond to IFN-beta by phosphorylation of STAT1 on Tyr701, although they display a relative increase in phosphorylation of the transcriptionally inactive STAT1beta when compared with STAT1alpha. Thus, HTLV-I promotes cell cycle progression in G1 by a mechanism that overcomes inhibitory signals, thereby circumventing an innate immune defense mechanism.
11090154	Influenza A virus NS1 protein prevents activation of NF-kappaB and induction of alpha/beta interferon.	The alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) system represents one of the first lines of defense against virus infections. As a result, most viruses encode IFN antagonistic factors which enhance viral replication in their hosts. We have previously shown that a recombinant influenza A virus lacking the NS1 gene (delNS1) only replicates efficiently in IFN-alpha/beta-deficient systems. Consistent with this observation, we found that infection of tissue culture cells with delNS1 virus, but not with wild-type influenza A virus, induced high levels of mRNA synthesis from IFN-alpha/beta genes, including IFN-beta. It is known that transactivation of the IFN-beta promoter depends on NF-kappaB and several other transcription factors. Interestingly, cells infected with delNS1 virus showed high levels of NF-kappaB activation compared with those infected with wild-type virus. Expression of dominant-negative inhibitors of the NF-kappaB pathway during delNS1 virus infection prevented the transactivation of the IFN-beta promoter, demonstrating a functional link between NF-kappaB activation and IFN-alpha/beta synthesis in delNS1 virus-infected cells. Moreover, expression of the NS1 protein prevented virus- and/or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated activation of the NF-kappaB pathway and of IFN-beta synthesis. This inhibitory property of the NS1 protein of influenza A virus was dependent on its ability to bind dsRNA, supporting a model in which binding of NS1 to dsRNA generated during influenza virus infection prevents the activation of the IFN system. NS1-mediated inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway may thus play a key role in the pathogenesis of influenza A virus.
11211884	Decline of hepatitis C virus load in serum during the first 24 h after administration of interferon-beta as a predictor of the efficacy of therapy.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) kinetics during interferon (IFN)-alpha treatment have been evaluated recently, however, little is known about the resultant viral kinetics in IFN-beta treatment. In this study, we evaluated HCV kinetics during the first 24 h of IFN-beta treatment, and also assessed their relationship to therapeutic outcomes. METHODS: We measured HCV RNA levels at 0 and 24 h after the initiation of IFN-beta treatment, and we calculated the decay slope, viral half-life, and viral production and clearance. Then we analyzed these factors as they related to therapeutic responses with IFN-beta as well as to clinical variables, i.e. genotype, diversity of hyper variable region, and histological findings. RESULTS: Patients with sustained responses (SR) displayed steeper decay slopes of the viral load than those without SR (2.87 +/- 1.41 vs. 1.82 +/- 1.66, P = 0.031). On the other hand, the decay slope was not affected by the clinical variables. The values of viral half-life and viral production and clearance showed no significant correlation to the response and the clinical variables. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the decay slope of the viral load during the first 24 h is related to the virological response to IFN-beta treatment.
11318525	Rapid decrease of plasma HCV RNA in early phase of twice daily administration of 3 MU doses interferon-beta in patients with genotype 1b hepatitis C infection: a multicenter randomized study.	Virological response to interferon (IFN) is poor in patients with plasma levels of HCV RNA higher than 1 Meq/ml and genotype 1b hepatitis C viral infection. In 60 patients, a randomized control study was conducted to compare 3 MU of IFN-beta twice daily for four weeks (group A) and 6 MU once a day for four weeks (group B) followed by a four-week administration of 6 MU once a day. The plasma levels of HCV RNA, determined by an amplicore-monitor method, for patients in group A were significantly lower than those for group B at the fourth and eighth day of IFN administration, and complete virological responses were noted in two patients from group A but none in group B. It is concluded that twice daily administration of 3 MU IFN-beta is more effective than once a day 6 MU in the early phase of IFN therapy.
11585785	Antiviral actions of interferons.	Tremendous progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis of the antiviral actions of interferons (IFNs), as well as strategies evolved by viruses to antagonize the actions of IFNs. Furthermore, advances made while elucidating the IFN system have contributed significantly to our understanding in multiple areas of virology and molecular cell biology, ranging from pathways of signal transduction to the biochemical mechanisms of transcriptional and translational control to the molecular basis of viral pathogenesis. IFNs are approved therapeutics and have moved from the basic research laboratory to the clinic. Among the IFN-induced proteins important in the antiviral actions of IFNs are the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), the 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and RNase L, and the Mx protein GTPases. Double-stranded RNA plays a central role in modulating protein phosphorylation and RNA degradation catalyzed by the IFN-inducible PKR kinase and the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate-dependent RNase L, respectively, and also in RNA editing by the IFN-inducible RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR1). IFN also induces a form of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS2) and the major histocompatibility complex class I and II proteins, all of which play important roles in immune response to infections. Several additional genes whose expression profiles are altered in response to IFN treatment and virus infection have been identified by microarray analyses. The availability of cDNA and genomic clones for many of the components of the IFN system, including IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and IFN-gamma, their receptors, Jak and Stat and IRF signal transduction components, and proteins such as PKR, 2',5'-OAS, Mx, and ADAR, whose expression is regulated by IFNs, has permitted the generation of mutant proteins, cells that overexpress different forms of the proteins, and animals in which their expression has been disrupted by targeted gene disruption. The use of these IFN system reagents, both in cell culture and in whole animals, continues to provide important contributions to our understanding of the virus-host interaction and cellular antiviral response.
11739693	Disturbance of tumor necrosis factor alpha-mediated beta interferon signaling in cervical carcinoma cells.	In the present study we show that malignant human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive cells lost their ability to synthesize endogenous beta interferon (IFN-beta) upon tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) treatment. IFN-beta transcription, however, was reinducible in nonmalignant HPV-positive cells, which was confirmed in functional protection assays against encephalomyocarditis virus or vesicular stomatitis virus infections. Addition of neutralizing antibodies against IFN-beta blocked the antiviral effect, excluding the possibility that other IFN types were involved. Conversely, both malignant and immortalized cells could be protected against viral cytolysis when either IFN-beta, IFN-alpha, or IFN-gamma was added exogenously. This indicates that only the cross talk between TNF-alpha and the IFN-beta pathways, and not IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma signaling in general, is perturbed in cervical carcinoma cells. Notably, full virus protection was restricted exclusively to nonmalignant cells, indicating that the antiviral effect correlates with the growth-inhibitory and virus-suppressive properties of TNF-alpha. The IFN-regulatory factors IRF-1 and p48 (ISGF3gamma) emerged as key regulatory molecules in the differential IFN-beta response, since their transcription was either absent or only inefficiently enhanced in tumorigenic cells upon treatment with TNF-alpha. Inducibility of both genes, however, became reestablished in cervical carcinoma cells, which were complemented to nontumorigenicity after somatic cell hybridization. Complementation was paralleled by the entire reconstitution of cytokine-mediated IFN-beta expression and the ability of TNF-alpha to exert an antiviral state. In contrast, under conditions where tumor suppression was not accomplished upon somatic cell hybridization, neither expression of IRF-1, p48, and IFN-beta nor antiviral activity could be restored.
12176137	Viral mediated gene transfer to sprouting blood vessels during angiogenesis.	Several experimental systems have been applied to investigate the development of new blood vessels. Angiogenesis can be followed ex-vivo by culturing explants of rat aorta 'rings' in biomatrix gels. This angiogenesis system was modified for the study of viral vector mediated gene transfer, using adenovirus, vaccinia- and retroviral vectors. Two modifications were introduced to the model in order to facilitate efficient viral mediated gene transfer, (i) placing the aorta ring on top of a thin layer of collagen such that the angiogenic tissue will be accessible to the viral vector; and (ii) infection of the aorta rings prior to embedding them into the collagen matrix. While adenovirus and vaccinia vectors infected efficiently the aorta rings they induced cell death. Subsequent gene transfer experiments were, therefore, carried with retroviral vectors containing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the beta-interferon (IFN) genes. Overexpression of VEGF enhanced significantly microvessel sprouting, while overexpression of IFN-beta induced an antiviral effect. The experimental system described in this study can facilitate the application of other viral vectors to the study of genes that may regulate the complex angiogenic process and thereby open new avenues for vascular gene therapy.
12225378	Synergy of type I interferon-A6 and interferon-B naked DNA immunotherapy for cytomegalovirus infection.	Delivery of type I IFN transgenes by naked DNA immunization can protect against cytomegalovirus infection and myocarditis. Here, we investigate IFN transgene expression, antiviral efficacy, and immunomodulation of myocarditis using various treatment regimes in a mouse CMV model. In vivo expression of the IFN transgene was observed in the sera for 35 days post-DNA inoculation. Prophylactic IFN-A6 and IFN-B DNA treatment for 14 days prior to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection was more efficacious in significantly reducing viral titres, than 2 days prior to or 2 days post-virus infection. Similarly, IFN-A6 DNA treatment commencing 14 days prior to virus infection was superior in suppressing both acute and chronic myocarditis. Furthermore, reduction of autoantibody titres was more pronounced when IFN was administered 14 days prior to viral infection. Combinational IFN gene therapy was assessed for synergy between IFN subtypes. Combination treatment with either IFN-A6/A9 or IFN-A6/B greatly reduced spleen viral titres while IFN-A6/B and IFN-A9/B reduced virus replication in the liver. Only IFN-A6/A9 and IFN-A9/B reduced acute viral myocarditis, whereas IFNA6/B treatment was most efficacious for autoimmune chronic myocarditis. Finally, treatment with IFN-A6 DNA 2 weeks post-MCMV infection proved effective at inhibiting the development of chronic autoimmune myocarditis. These findings suggest that immunomodulation of both antiviral and autoimmune responses by IFN DNA immunization may be an avenue for improved viral immunotherapy.
12323398	Transient transfection of mouse fibroblasts with type I interferon transgenes provides various degrees of protection against herpes simplex virus infection.	Type I interferons (IFN) constitute one of the initial and most potent components of the innate immune response against viral infections. While there is only one IFN-beta gene, there are several IFN-alpha genes whose products act through the same receptor calling into question the role of these gene products against viral infection. The focus of the present study was to compare the anti-viral state of cells transiently transfected with different murine type I IFN transgenes including IFN-alpha1, -alpha4, -alpha5, -alpha6, -alpha9, and IFN-beta. Transfected cells produced biologically active IFN ranging from 6 to 46 units/ml. L929 and 3T12.3 cells transfected with the IFN-beta transgene consistently showed a 2-4 fold reduction in herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 viral titers compared with cells transfected with the IFN-alpha transgenes which were much less consistent based on HSV species and cell type. Parallel with the reduction in viral titers, cells transfected with the IFN-beta transgene showed the complete absence or significant reduction in viral immediate early, early, and late gene expression. Collectively, the results suggest that the IFN-beta transgene is superior to IFN-alpha transgenes against HSV infection in vitro in part due to a reduction in viral gene expression. These results indicate events downstream of the type I IFN receptor distinguish between the subtypes of IFN-alpha species relative to the activation of genes ultimately responsible for the establishment of the anti-HSV state.
12915551	Interferon regulatory factor 7 regulates expression of Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1: a regulatory circuit.	We have shown previously that interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), a multifunctional protein intimately involved in latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, is induced as well as activated by EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), the principal EBV oncoprotein. Since the LMP1 promoter (LMP1p) contains an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE), we hypothesized that IRF7 might be able to regulate LMP1 expression and thus participate in a regulatory circuit between these two genes. In this study, IRF7 was shown first to activate LMP1p in transient transfection assays. Compared with EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2), the most potent viral transactivator of LMP1p, IRF7 has a lesser effect (approximately 10% that of EBNA2) on induction of LMP1p. Study with IRF7 deletion mutants showed that IRF7 functional domains have similar effects on both the beta interferon (IFN-beta) and LMP1 promoters in BJAB and 293 cells, and study with IRF7 phosphomimetic mutants showed that IRF7 phosphorylation may be involved in the activation of these two promoters. Further, the ISRE in LMP1p responds to IRF7 induction and IRF7 binds to this element. In the EBV-positive cell line P3HR1, which lacks the complete EBNA2 and EBV-encoded leader protein genes and hence expresses low-level LMP1, IRF7 alone can notably increase the endogenous LMP1 mRNA and protein levels. These results indicate that LMP1 is regulated by this host cell gene in addition to the viral factor, EBNA2, and may help to explain how LMP1 is expressed in type II latency in the absence of EBNA2. Moreover, IRF7 can regulate a viral gene in addition to a host cellular gene such as the IFN-beta gene. Together with the previous data that LMP1 can induce IRF7 expression and facilitate IRF7 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, these results suggest a positive regulatory circuit between IRF7 and LMP1.
9581891	The HIV type 1 coreceptor CCR5 and its role in viral transmission and disease progression.	The purified CD4+ lymphocytes of a group of highly exposed but HIV-1-uninfected individuals were determined to be less susceptible to infection with multiple non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) primary isolates of HIV-1 than were CD4+ lymphocytes from nonexposed control individuals. This relative resistance to HIV-1 infection did not extend to T cell line-adapted or syncytium-inducing (SI) primary viral isolates, was restricted by the envelope glycoprotein, and was associated with an increased production of the C-C chemokines RANTES, MIP-1alpha, and MIP-1beta. The block to replication in CD4+ lymphocytes from two exposed-uninfected subjects was at the point of entry, as was the block imposed by the recombinant C-C chemokines RANTES, MIP-1alpha, and MIP-1beta. Resistance to infection and the high production of beta chemokines were characteristic of every CD4+ lymphocyte clone from the exposed-uninfected subjects. We have now identified the mechanism underlying this in vitro and in vivo resistance to infection: These individuals have inherited a homozygous 32-bp nucleotide deletion (delta32) within the gene encoding the coreceptor for primary NSI isolates of HIV-1 (CCR5). This deletion encodes a severely truncated and unstable protein that is not expressed on the cell surface. This allele is common in the Caucasian population, with a frequency of 0.0808, but is not found in people of African or Asian ancestry. To determine its role in HIV-1 transmission and disease progression, we analyzed the CCR5 genotype of 1252 homosexual men enrolled in the Chicago component of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). No infected participant was found to be homozygous for the delta32 allele whereas 3.6% of at-risk but uninfected Caucasian participants were homozygous, showing the highly protective role of this genotype against sexual acquisition of HIV-1. No evidence was found to suggest that heterozygotes were protected against HIV-1 infection, but a limited protective role against disease progression was noted. The delta32 allele of CCR5 is therefore an important host factor in HIV-1 transmission and pathogenesis.
10319275	Interferon-induced proteins are elevated in blood samples of patients with chemically or virally induced chronic fatigue syndrome.	Overlapping symptomatologies between Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Chemical Sensitivity have been observed by different investigators. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop biomarker(s) for possible differentiation between viral induced CFS (without sensitivity to chemicals) versus chemically induced CFS. Since interferon induced proteins 2-5A Synthetase and Protein Kinase RNA (PKR) have been implicated in the viral induction of CFS, the objective of this study was to utilize 2-5A and PKR activity for differentiation between CFS induced by either viruses or chemicals. Based on the CDC definition and criteria, twenty CFS patients who were positive for viral genome(s) (mainly HHV6; HTLVII, EBV, and CMV) and did not have any history of exposure to toxic chemicals were included in this study. As a comparison, the second group of patients consisted of twenty individuals from the same geographical area who were negative for viral genomes but had been exposed to methyl tertiary-butyl ether concentration of up to 70 ppb and benzene concentration up to 14 ppb. All patients complained of fatigue and other symptoms overlapping between the two groups. From all 40 patients, blood was drawn, leukocyte extract was prepared and assayed for 2-5A Synthetase and PKR activity. Clinical specimens which were positive for viral genomes showed from 2.2-38.7 fold increase in 2-5A activity and 1.3-13.5 fold increase in PKR activities over the background of the healthy controls. Similarly, the second group (negative for viral genomes, but exposed to chemicals) showed a 1.1-29.2 fold increase for 2-5A Synthetase and a 1.3-11.6 fold increase for PKR when they were compared to healthy subjects. To elucidate mechanisms involved in viral versus chemical induction of 2-5A Synthetase and PKR, MDBK cell lines were cultured either in the presence or absence of HHV6, MTBE, or Benzene, heat shock proteins and interferon-beta. 2-5A and PKR activities were measured in all the above conditions. A clear induction of 2-5A and PKR was observed when MDBK cells were exposed to HHV6, MTBE, and Benzene. This induction was more significant with HSP90, HSP70, and IFN-beta indicating their involvement in the mechanism of action. However, when MDBK cells were incubated either with MTBE + Benzene or HHV6 in the presence or absence of anti IFN-beta or anti-HSP-70, the activities of both 2-5A and PKR in HHV6 infected cells were inhibited by more than 90% due to addition of anti IFN-beta, and only 20% by addition of anti-HSP70. While in MTBE + Benzene exposed cells anti IFN-beta reduced the activity of these enzymes by 40% and anti-HSP70 by more than 90%. This variation in the induction of 2-5A and PKR by anti-HSP70 or IFN-beta indicates involvement of IFN-beta in viral induction 2-5A and PKR, and HSP involvement in chemical induction of these enzymes. We conclude that 2-5A and PKR are not only biomarkers for viral induction of CFS, but biomarkers to other stressors that include MTBE and Benzene.
10785400	Interferon-alpha synergistically enhances induction of interleukin-6 by double stranded RNA in HeLa cells.	Double stranded RNA (dsRNA), an intermediate that is common during viral infection, directly induces much higher levels of expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA than does the cytokine IL-1beta. Interferon alpha (IFNalpha) by itself does not induce expression of IL-6; nonetheless, IFNalpha pretreatment dramatically enhances IL-6 induction by dsRNA but not by IL-1beta. Mutation of either the activating transcription factor/cyclic AMP response element binding protein (ATF/CREB) or the NF-IL-6 binding element within the IL-6 promoter eliminates most responsiveness of CAT reporter constructs to either dsRNA or to IL-1beta. IFNalpha pretreatment partially restores responsiveness to dsRNA but not to IL-1beta when either the ATF/CREB site or the NF-IL-6 site is mutated, but at least one of these sites must be intact for responsiveness to be restored. Mutation of the kappaB binding site in the IL-6 promoter eliminates responsiveness to either IL-1beta or to dsRNA, and pretreatment with IFNalpha does not restore any responsiveness. Incubation with dsRNA leads to a decrease in protein translation, especially in cells that have been pretreated with IFNalpha. Nonetheless, IFNalpha pretreatment followed by dsRNA leads to very high IL-6 protein levels. These studies demonstrate that major differences exist in the induction of IL-6 at both the mRNA and protein levels by dsRNA compared to cytokines and that IFNalpha pretreatment selectively enhances IL-6 induction by dsRNA but not by IL-1beta. The high levels of IL-6 expression that result when cells encounter class I IFN prior to dsRNA suggest a mechanism for a heightened host response to viral infection with heightened production of this pleotropic cytokine.
10864659	Soluble receptor-induced retroviral infection of receptor-deficient cells.	Current models of retroviral entry hypothesize that interactions between the host cell receptor(s) and viral envelope protein induce structural changes in the envelope protein that convert it to an active conformation, allowing it to mediate fusion with the membrane. Recent evidence supporting this hypothesis is the demonstration that Tva, the receptor for subgroup A avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV-A), induces conformational changes in the viral envelope protein. These changes include conversion of the envelope protein to an active, membrane-binding state likely representing a fusogenic conformation. To determine whether binding of the soluble Tva (sTva) receptor was sufficient to activate fully the fusogenic potential of the ASLV-A envelope protein, we have evaluated the ability of ASLV-A to infect receptor-deficient cell lines in the presence of sTva. Soluble receptor efficiently mediated infection of cells devoid of endogenous Tva in a dose-dependent manner, and this infection was dependent absolutely on the addition of sTva. The infectivity of the virus was enhanced dramatically in the presence of the polycationic polymer Polybrene or when centrifugal forces were applied during inoculation, resulting in viral titers comparable to those achieved on cells expressing endogenous receptor. sTva functioned to mediate infection at low concentrations, approaching the estimated binding constant of the receptor and viral envelope protein. These results demonstrate that receptor binding can activate the ASLV-A envelope protein and convert it to a fusogenic conformation competent to mediate the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes.
10954520	Bovine respiratory syncytial virus nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS2 cooperatively antagonize alpha/beta interferon-induced antiviral response.	The functions of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS2 were studied by generation and analysis of recombinant BRSV carrying single and double gene deletions. Whereas in MDBK cells the lack of either or both NS genes resulted in a 5,000- to 10,000-fold reduction of virus titers, in Vero cells a moderate (10-fold) reduction was observed. Interestingly, cell culture supernatants from infected MDBK cells were able to restrain the growth of NS deletion mutants in Vero cells, suggesting the involvement of NS proteins in escape from cytokine-mediated host cell responses. The responsible factors in MDBK supernatants were identified as type I interferons by neutralization of the inhibitory effect with antibodies blocking the alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) receptor. Treatment of cells with recombinant universal IFN-alpha A/D or IFN-beta revealed severe inhibition of single and double deletion mutants, whereas growth of full-length BRSV was not greatly affected. Surprisingly, all NS deletion mutants were equally repressed, indicating an obligatory cooperation of NS1 and NS2 in antagonizing IFN-mediated antiviral mechanisms. To verify this finding, we generated recombinant rabies virus (rRV) expressing either NS1 or NS2 and determined their IFN sensitivity. In cells coinfected with NS1- and NS2-expressing rRVs, virus replication was resistant to doses of IFN which caused a 1,000-fold reduction of replication in cells infected with wild-type RV or with each of the NS-expressing rRVs alone. Thus, BRSV NS proteins have the potential to cooperatively protect an unrelated virus from IFN-alpha/beta mediated antiviral responses. Interestingly, BRSV NS proteins provided a more pronounced resistance to IFN in the bovine cell line MDBK than in cell lines of other origins, suggesting adaptation to host-specific antiviral responses. The findings described have a major impact on the design of live recombinant BRSV and HRSV vaccines.
11494312	Studies on p53 and Bax protein expression in Cockayne syndrome cells after UV irradiation and interferon-beta treatment.	Human interferon (HuIFN) has a protective effect against ultraviolet (UV)-induced killing of Cockayne syndrome (CS) and xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) cells. Irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) resulted in nuclear accumulation of p53 in normal human fibroblast cells, and this accumulation was suppressed by treatment with HuIFN-beta. On the other hand, a large amount of p53 was found in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of one SV40-transformed XP and two SV40-transformed CS cell strains irrespective of UV irradiation. Treatment with HuIFN-beta reduced the level of pro-apoptotic Bax protein without suppression of nuclear accumulation of p53 in the CS cells but not in the XP cells. These findings suggest that there are different mechanisms of UV-refractoriness caused by HuIFN-beta in UV-sensitive CS and XP cells.
11592839	Human and mouse IFN-beta gene therapy exhibits different anti-tumor mechanisms in mouse models.	Previously, we suggested that local human interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene therapy with replication-defective adenoviral vectors can be an effective cancer treatment. Clinical trials to treat cancers with adenovirus expressing the human IFN-beta gene (IFNB1) has been planned. As a continued effort to explore the mechanisms of action of human IFN-beta gene therapy that can occur in the clinical setting, we tested mouse IFN-beta gene therapy in human xenograft tumors in both ex vivo and in vivo models. Delivery of the mouse IFN-beta gene (Ifnb) caused tumor inhibition; this effect was dependent on the indirect anti-tumor activities of IFN-beta, notably a stimulation of natural killer cells. IFN-beta does not show cross-species activity in its anti-proliferative effect and mouse IFN-beta does not cause as significant an anti-proliferative effect on mouse tumor cells as human IFN-beta causes on human tumor cells. Therefore, we believe that mouse models using either human IFN-beta or mouse IFN-beta gene transfer do not capture all aspects of the action of adenovirus-mediated human IFN-beta gene therapy that may be present in the clinical setting. Due to its multiple mechanisms of action, human IFN-beta gene therapy may be effective in treating human cancers that are either sensitive or resistant to the direct anti-proliferative effect of IFN-beta.
11602722	Human Mast cell progenitors can be infected by macrophagetropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and retain virus with maturation in vitro.	Mast cells are critical components of innate and adaptive immunity that differentiate in tissues in situ from circulating committed progenitor cells. We now demonstrate that human cord blood-derived mast cell progenitors are susceptible to infection with macrophagetropic (M-tropic) and dualtropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates but not with T-cell-tropic (T-tropic) strains. Mast cell progenitors (c-kit(+) CD13(+) cells with chloroacetate esterase activity) were purified from 4-week-old cultures of cord blood mononuclear cells maintained in stem cell factor, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-10 using a CD14 depletion column. These progenitors expressed CCR3, CCR5, and CXCR4, as well as low levels of CD4. When infected in vitro with viruses pseudotyped with different HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoproteins, only M-tropic and dualtropic, but not T-tropic, viruses were able to enter mast cell progenitors. Both the CCR5-specific monoclonal antibody 2D7 and TAK-779, a nonpeptide inhibitor of CCR5-mediated viral entry, blocked HIV-1 strain ADA infection by >80%. Cultures infected with replication-competent virus produced progressively increasing amounts of virus for 21 days as indicated by p24 antigen detection. Mast cell progenitors that were exposed to an M-tropic, green fluorescent protein-expressing HIV-1 strain exhibited fluorescence indicative of viral entry and replication on a single-cell level and retained virus production during differentiation. The trafficking of mast cell progenitors to multiple tissues, combined with the long life span of mature mast cells, suggests that they could provide a widespread and persistent HIV reservoir in AIDS.
11745330	Antiviral response by natural killer cells through TRAIL gene induction by IFN-alpha/beta.	Natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in early defense against viral infection. The cytotoxic activity of NK cells is increased by interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta), produced en masse in virally infected cells. However, the mechanism(s) by which IFN-alpha/beta contribute to the NK-cell-mediated antiviral response is not well understood. Here we provide evidence that the cytotoxicity of NK cells is enhanced by IFN-alpha/beta through induction of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Isolation and analysis of the murine TRAIL promoter revealed the presence of an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE), which binds to the transcription factor ISGF3 (interferon stimulated gene factor-3). This promoter is indeed activated by IFN-beta in ISGF3-dependent manner. We also show that virally infected cells, but not uninfected cells, are susceptible to TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro, and that the TRAIL expressed in NK cells is indeed crucial in limiting virus replication in vivo. Thus, our study reveals a new molecular link between IFN-alpha/beta signaling and activation of NK cells in antiviral response of the host.
11777824	Viral replication and host gene expression in alveolar macrophages infected with Ebola virus (Zaire strain).	In order to characterize the cellular response to and identify potential diagnostic markers for the early detection of Ebola virus, an in vitro culture system involving nonhuman primate alveolar macrophages was developed. Ebola virus replication in the alveolar macrophages was characterized by plaque assay, immunohistochemical analysis, and in situ hybridization. Fluorogenic 5'-nuclease assays specific for nonhuman primate proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were designed and used to evaluate mRNA transcription in macrophages infected with Ebola virus. Transient increases in cytokine and chemokine mRNA levels were observed immediately following exposure to Ebola virus. At 2 h postexposure, levels of cytokine and chemokine mRNAs were markedly reduced. Although Ebola virus infection of alveolar macrophages failed to induce a sustained increase in proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine mRNA transcription (potentially reducing the use of these markers as diagnostic tools), the fluorogenic 5'-nuclease assays developed may have prognostic value for individuals infected with Ebola virus. Recently published data have indicated that persons who remain asymptomatic after exposure to Ebola virus are capable of mounting an early proinflammatory cytokine response and that those who become clinically ill are not. If implemented immediately after exposure, these assays could be used to predict which individuals will be more likely to remain asymptomatic as opposed to those who will be more likely to develop clinical signs and eventually succumb to the virus.
12184914	Interleukin-1-mediated inhibition of cytomegalovirus replication is due to increased IFN-beta production.	Previous studies have demonstrated that the intercellular spread of cytomegalovirus (CMV) is reduced in marrow stromal cells that either secrete interleukin-1 (IL-1) or are treated with exogenous IL-1. Here, we report that IL-1-treated marrow stromal cells and fibroblasts, when infected with CMV, produce decreased amounts of infectious progeny virus. CMV-infected cells treated with IL-1 contained more interferon-beta (IFN-beta) mRNA at 24 h postinfection compared with untreated, infected cells. IFN-beta protein secreted into fibroblast culture supernatants increased from 46 +/- 1 IU/ml in untreated, infected cells to 116 +/- 5 IU/ml in IL-1-treated infected cells. When IFN-beta activity was inhibited, using blocking antibodies to either the cytokine or the IFN-alpha/beta receptor, the addition of IL-1 no longer limited viral spread. Furthermore, viral spread in nonIL-1-treated cultures was inhibited by the addition of recombinant IFN-beta. These studies suggest that IL-1 functions to limit CMV spread by increasing the expression of IFN-beta, which in turn reduces production of infectious virus.
12824884	New aspects of IFN-alpha/beta signalling in immunity, oncogenesis and bone metabolism.	"Although interferons (IFNs) were originally identified as humoral factors that confer an antiviral state upon cells, they have been demonstrated to be multifunctional in a variety of biological systems. The IFN-alpha/beta system modulates not only the cellular immune response to viral and bacterial infections, but also the oncogenic process and bone metabolism. Further studies have revealed additional unique facets of the IFN-alpha/beta system. A weak signal by constitutively produced IFN-alpha/beta is critical not only for the regulation of cellular amplification of IFN-alpha/beta production upon viral infection or the enhancement of signalling by other cytokines, but also for the regulation of adaptive immune responses, such as the enhancement of CD8()+ T cell activation. Furthermore, IFN-beta signalling is critical for the regulation of the bone-resorbing osteoclasts. In this review, we focus on the newly discovered roles of the IFN-alpha/beta system in host defense and bone remodeling, particularly on the functions of the weak IFN-alpha/beta signalling in the context of what we refer to as the ""revving-up"" model."
12965252	Interferon-beta suppresses herpes simplex virus type 1 replication in trigeminal ganglion cells through an RNase L-dependent pathway.	The induction of an antiviral state by type I interferons (IFN) was evaluated in primary trigeminal ganglion cell cultures using herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Cells treated with mouse IFN-beta consistently showed the greatest resistance to HSV-1 infection in comparison to cells treated with IFN-alpha1, IFN-alpha4, IFN-alpha5, IFN-alpha6, or IFN-alpha9. The antiviral efficacy was dose-dependent and correlated with the induction of the IFN-inducible, antiviral genes, 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase. In trigeminal ganglion cells deficient in the downstream effector molecule of the OAS pathway, RNase L, the antiviral state induced by IFN-beta was lost.
7511818	Blocking of retroviral infection at a step prior to reverse transcription in cells transformed to constitutively express interferon beta.	We are developing methods for somatic-cell gene therapy directed against infection with human immunodeficiency virus, by enhancing antiviral resistance of target cells through the constitutive production of autocrine interferon (IFN). Using the human IFN-beta coding sequence under the constitutive low-expression control of a 0.6-kb murine H-2Kb promoter-fragment, we have constructed a retroviral vector, HMB-KbHuIFN beta, and have transformed cells of the T98G human neuroblastoma line, the U-937 human promonocytic line, and the CEM human lymphocytic line. These human IFN-beta-transformed cell populations have acquired a low, constitutive production of human IFN, while replicating at a rate similar to that of untransformed cells and of cells transformed with the control vector carrying a human IFN-beta sequence encoding an inactive, mutated protein. In the three different cell populations tested, transformation with the HMB-KbHuIFN beta vector resulted in a 1.3-2.3 log10 reduction in the number of cells infected with a defective amphotropic MFG-LaZ retrovirus. A kinetic study of the fate of the MFG-LacZ retrovirus in the culture medium and intracellularly immediately after exposure of the cells to virus revealed a significant reduction of the appearance of intracellular virus in human IFN-beta-transformed cells. A similar effect was obtained by treating untransformed T98G, U-937, and CEM cells with exogenous human IFN-beta. The blocking effect of autocrine or exogenous human IFN-beta on viral entry was not limited to virus specific for the amphotropic receptor but was also obtained in murine IFN-beta-treated NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts infected with an ecotropic MFG-LacZ retrovirus. Infection of human IFN-beta-transformed CEM cells with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gave comparable results. Immediately following exposure of the cells to human immunodeficiency virus, a kinetic study of the fate of the virus failed to reveal the appearance of intracellular virus and showed that the majority of the input virus remained in the extracellular medium. We conclude that low autocrine IFN-beta synthesis, or exposure of cells to exogenous IFN-beta, prevents virus from getting inside the cells, regardless of the virus receptor involved.
7705744	Stable antiviral expression (SAVE) as an approach to somatic cell gene therapy directed against HIV infection.	We are developing methods for somatic cell gene therapy directed against infection with human immunodeficiency virus by enhancing the antiviral resistance of target cells through the constitutive production of interferon-beta. Cells that have been transformed by plasmids or retroviral vectors carrying the human interferon-beta gene placed under the expression control of a murine H2Kb promoter fragment become resistant to HIV infection. Part of this enhanced resistance is due to inhibition of virus entry into the transformed cells, a hitherto unreported mechanism of interferon action.
7843405	Possible involvement of the transcription factor ISGF3 gamma in virus-induced expression of the IFN-beta gene.	Two virus-inducible transcription factors, IRF-1 and IRF-2 have been identified as an activator and a repressor, respectively, of the type I interferon (IFN) genes. Recent studies with mice carrying null mutations for the IRF-1 or IRF-2 alleles have revealed the existence of IRF-1-dependent and -independent pathways mediating IFN-beta gene induction. Here we report that the expression of an IRF family member ISGF3 gamma is induced upon viral infection in IRF-1-/-, IRF-2-/- embryonic fibroblasts. Furthermore, ISGF3 gamma can bind to a virus-inducible promoter element in the IFN-beta gene. These results suggest that ISGF3 gamma or complex containing ISGF3 gamma is involved in the IRF-1-independent pathway mediating IFN-beta gene regulation.
9574532	Type I IFNs inhibit human dendritic cell IL-12 production and Th1 cell development.	We have investigated the role of type I IFNs (IFN-alpha and -beta) in human T cell differentiation using anti-CD3 mAb and allogeneic, in vitro-derived dendritic cells (DC) as APCs. DC were very efficient activators of naive CD4+ T cells, providing necessary costimulation and soluble factors to support Th1 differentiation and expansion. Addition of IFN-alphabeta to DC/T cell cultures resulted in induction of T cell IL-10 production and inhibition of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and LT secretion. Diminished T cell IFN-gamma production correlated with IFN-alphabeta-mediated inhibition of the p40 chain of the IL-12 heterodimer secreted by DC. Suppression of p40 IL-12 and IFN-gamma was not due to increased levels of IL-10 in these cultures, and production of IFN-gamma could be restored by exogenous IL-12. These data indicate that type I IFNs inhibit DC p40 IL-12 expression, which is required for development of IFN-gamma-producing CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, when T cells were restimulated without IFN-beta, these cells induced less p40 IL-12 from DC, suggesting that the functional properties of T cells may regulate DC function. Thus, IFN-alphabeta inhibits both IL-12-dependent and independent Th1 cytokine production and provides a mechanism for inhibition of IL-12-mediated immunity in viral infections.
11324727	Twice-daily administration of interferon-beta for chronic hepatitis C is not superior to a once-daily regimen.	PURPOSE: Although interferon (IFN) is commonly used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, eradication of the virus occurs in only a small proportion of patients with genotype 1b and a high virus titer. Modified IFN therapies have been tried, with only limited benefit. Recently, the administration of IFN-beta twice per day has been reported to be more effective than the usual once-daily administration regimen. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether twice-daily IFN results in a sustained response in patients with chronic HCV infection with genotype 1b, and a high virus titer. METHODS: Twenty patients with genotype 1b and high HCV RNA level (more than 1 MEq/ml by branched DNA probe assay) were randomly assigned to receive either twice-daily 3 MU of IFN beta (group A) or once-daily 6 MU of IFN-beta (group B) for 4 weeks. All patients received a further daily dose of 6 MU IFN-beta for 12 weeks, followed by IFN-alfa three times a week for 16 weeks. RESULTS: Although a rapid fall in HCV RNA levels was noted in group A, a sustained response was observed in only one of nine patients in this group, and none of group B. Adverse effects of IFN were more frequent and pronounced in group A than in group B. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that further modification, which combines the early strong anti-viral effects of the twice-daily regimen with long-term sustained response, is necessary for effective therapy of HCV patients with genotype 1b and high HCV RNA levels.
11355893	Gene induction pathways mediated by distinct IRFs during viral infection.	During viral infection, interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta) and many IFN-inducible genes are induced to elicit antiviral responses of the host. Using cells with a gene disruption(s) for the IRF family of transcription factors, we provide evidence that these genes, containing similar IRF-binding cis-elements, are classified into distinct groups, based on the gene induction pathway(s). The IFN-beta gene induction is dependent on either IRF-3 or IRF-7, whereas induction of the IFN-alpha gene family is IRF-7-dependent. On the other hand, ISG15, ISG54 and IP-10 are induced by either IRF-3 or IFN stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). We also show that another group of genes is totally dependent on ISGF3. Thus, during viral infection, a given gene responds either directly to a virus or virus-induced IFN-alpha/beta or both through distinct pathways. The differential utilization of these induction pathways for these genes during viral infection may reflect their distinct functional roles in the efficient antiviral response.
11401490	PACT, a double-stranded RNA binding protein acts as a positive regulator for type I interferon gene induced by Newcastle disease virus.	Virus infection triggers innate responses to host cells including production of type I interferon (IFN). Since IFN production is also induced by treatment with poly(I:C), viral double-stranded (ds) RNA has been postulated to play a direct role in the process. In the present study, we investigated the effect of dsRNA binding proteins on virus-induced activation of the IFN-beta gene. We found that PACT, originally identified as protein activator for dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and implicated in the regulation of translation, augmented IFN-beta gene activation induced by Newcastle disease virus. Concomitantly with the augmented activity of IFN-beta enhancer, increased activity of NF-kappaB and IRF-3 and IRF-7 was observed. For the observed effect, the dsRNA-binding activity of PACT was essential. We identified residues of PACT that interact with a presumptive target molecule to exert its function. Furthermore, PACT colocalized with viral replication complex in the infected cells. Thus the observed effect of PACT is novel and PACT is involved in the regulation of viral replication and results in a marked increase of cellular IFN-beta gene expression.
11991674	Different activities of type I interferons on hepatitis B virus core promoter regulated transcription.	The type I interferons (IFNs) are a group of closely related cytokines which have different signal transduction pathways and different biological activities. Using transient transfection of human hepatoma cells with reporter plasmids containing the firefly/renilla luciferase genes under the control of the HBV-Enhancer (Enh) I, Enh II and core promoter we have investigated the biological activities of 10 recombinant (r) type I IFNs on transcription. Low concentrations of IFN (0.025 ng/ml) had a significant and specific inhibitory effect but the potencies of the different recombinant type I IFNs differed markedly with IFNalpha8 and IFNbeta being six-fold more potent than the least effective subtype (IFNalpha1). However, the addition of IFNalpha5-the subtype produced predominantly in the human liver-did not cause any synergistic effects.The non-natural consensus IFN displayed a more pronounced inhibition of HBV-regulated transcription than IFNalpha8 or IFNalpha2 but not IFNbeta. The INF-induced inhibitory effect was not dependent on the presence of the HBV-Enh1 and in particular of an interferon stimulated response element (ISRE)-like sequence. The characterization of different effects among type I interferons on HBV-regulatory elements may implicate an IFN-subtype-specific role for the pathogenesis and treatment of HBV-infection.
12680611	HLA-A2-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity during interferon beta therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) may contribute to viral clearance and liver cell injury in patients with chronic hepatitis C. In the present study, we attempted to determine the serial HCV-specific CTL activity during interferon-beta (IFN-beta) therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C and whether there is any relationship between the CTL response and clinical response to IFN-beta therapy. METHODS: Eight HLA-A2-positive patients with chronic hepatitis C were treated initially with 6 million U/ml of IFN-beta every day for 8 weeks and then 3 times weekly for the subsequent 16 weeks. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected before the start, 4 weeks after the start, and after the end of IFN treatment and were stimulated with 2 peptides corresponding to core sequences, which were previously reported to have an HLA-A2 restricted-CTL epitopes. Cytolytic activity was determined by a standard 51Cr-release assay using allogenic HLA-matched EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL). RESULTS: HCV-specific CTL responses were detected in 2 of the 8 patients before treatment with IFN-beta. One of 2 patients was not observed HCV-specific CTL responses after 4 weeks of IFN-beta treatment, however these two patients showed CTL responses at the end of IFN-beta treatment, and finally HCV-RNA was negative. In addition, HCV-specific CTL responses were observed in 4 patients after 4 weeks of IFN-beta treatment. Three of these 4 patients showed CTL responses only at 4 weeks after IFN-beta treatment. However, there were no differences between clinical parameters or between IFN efficacy in HCV specific CTL response-positive (n = 4) and -negative (n = 4) patients at 4 weeks after the start of IFN-beta treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that there are few relations between peripheral HCV-specific CTL response and clinical response to IFN therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C, although IFN enhances the host immune response against HCV synergistically with antiviral activities.
10559337	Interferon regulatory factor 3 is required for viral induction of beta interferon in primary cardiac myocyte cultures.	Viral myocarditis affects an estimated 5 to 20% of the human population. The antiviral cytokine beta interferon (IFN-beta) is critical for protection against viral myocarditis in mice. That is, nonmyocarditic reoviruses induce myocarditis in mice that lack IFN-alpha/beta, and nonmyocarditic reoviruses both induce more IFN-beta and are more sensitive to the antiviral effects of IFN-beta than myocarditic reoviruses in primary cardiac myocyte cultures. Induction of IFN-beta in certain cell types involves viral activation of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). To address whether IRF-3 can induce IFN-beta in cardiac myocytes, primary cardiac myocyte cultures and control L929 cells were transfected with a plasmid constitutively expressing IRF-3. Overexpression of IRF-3 resulted in induction of IFN-beta in the absence of viral infection in both cell types. To address whether IRF-3 is required for viral induction of IFN-beta, cell cultures were transfected with a plasmid constitutively expressing a dominant negative IRF-3 protein. The dominant negative IRF-3 reduced reovirus induction of IFN-beta in control L929 cells and completely eliminated induction in primary cardiac myocyte cultures. This provides the first identification of a cardiac cellular factor required for viral induction of IFN-beta and the first report of any cell type requiring IRF-3 for this response.
10860892	Role of type I IFNs in the in vitro attenuation of live, temperature-sensitive vaccine strains of human respiratory syncytial virus.	The contributions of type I interferons (IFNs) to the in vitro attenuation of three temperature-sensitive (Ts) subgroup A and one subgroup B deletion mutant RSV strains were evaluated. The ability of these vaccine viruses to induce IFNs at their permissive and restrictive temperatures and their sensitivity to the antiviral effects of exogenous I IFNs were tested in human lung epithelial A549 cells. Our results show that the highly attenuated and immunogenic subgroup A vaccine strain Ts1C produced higher levels of IFN-beta than its parent RSS-2 or two related strains, Ts1A and Ts1B, at their permissive temperature. Growth of RSV-infected A549 cultures at restrictive temperatures or prior UV inactivation of the virus abolished the observed induction of IFN-beta, suggesting a strict requirement of viral replication for cellular IFN induction. The enhanced induction of IFN-beta by the highly immunogenic Ts1C at permissive temperature may be an advantageous characteristic of a live intranasal vaccine candidate. The subgroup B strain RSV B1 and its mutant cp-52 (with SH and G gene deletions) both induced similar but low levels of IFN-beta. Hence the observed overattenuation of cp-52 in human infants is probably not due to enhanced IFN induction during its replication in the host. The ability of cp-52, which does not express the SH and G proteins, to induce IFN-beta levels similar to those of its parent strain suggests that these viral proteins may not have a role in the induction of IFN-beta in the host. In addition, both subgroup A and B mutants and their respective parent strains were similarly resistant to the antiviral effects of exogenous IFN-alpha or -beta. Therefore, increased sensitivity of the mutants to IFNs does not seem to contribute to their attenuation.
11256746	Interferon activation and innate immunity.	The interferons are a family of cytokine mediators critically involved in alerting the cellular immune system to viral infection of host cells. Interferons not only exhibit important antiviral effects but also exert a key influence on the quality of the cellular immune responses and amplify antigen presentation to specific T cells. Type I interferon (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta) is secreted by virus-infected cells while type II, immune or gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) is mainly secreted by T cells, natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages. Interferons interact with specific cellular receptors, which promote production of second messengers ultimately leading to expression of antiviral and immune modulatory genes. The IFN genes themselves are regulated by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms including modulation by a family of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) synthesised by host cells. IFNs activate macrophages, induce B cells to switch immunoglobulin type, alter T helper response, inhibit cell growth, promote apoptosis and induce an antiviral state in uninfected cells. The therapeutic potential of the IFNs is currently the focus of intense attention in a number of virus-associated diseases, tumours and autoimmune disorders.
11489424	Caveolae as portals of entry for microbes.	Many pathogens, including many traditionally extracellular microbes, now appear capable of entry into host cells with limited loss of viability. A portal of entry shared by some bacteria, bacterial toxins, viruses and parasites are caveolae (or lipid rafts), which are involved in the import and intracellular translocation of macromolecules in host cells. A requirement for caveolae-mediated endocytosis of microbes appears to be that the respective receptor is a constituent of caveolae or must move to caveolae following ligation.
12093169	Interferon regulatory factor-1, interferon-beta, and reovirus-induced myocarditis.	Viral myocarditis is an important human disease, and reovirus-induced myocarditis in mice provides an excellent model to study direct viral damage to the heart. Previously, we showed that reovirus induction of and sensitivity to interferon-beta (IFN-beta) is an important determinant of viral pathogenicity in the heart and that the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) is required for reovirus induction of IFN-beta in primary cardiac myocyte cultures. Given several lines of evidence suggesting a possible distinctive environment for IRFs in the heart, we have now focused on IRF-1. Previous studies demonstrated that viruses, double-stranded-RNA (dsRNA), and IFN-alpha/beta can each induce IRF-1 and that IRF-1 plays a role in dsRNA, but perhaps not viral, induction of IFN-alpha/beta. Importantly, none of these studies used a virus with a dsRNA genome (such as reovirus), none of them used a highly differentiated nonlymphoid cell type, and none of them addressed whether viral induction of IRF-1 is direct or is mediated through viral induction of IFN-beta. Indeed, as recently as this year it has been assumed that viral induction of IRF-1 is direct. Here, we found that reovirus induced IRF-1 in primary cardiac myocyte cultures, but that IRF-1 was not required for reovirus induction of IFN-beta. Surprisingly, we found that reovirus failed to induce IRF-1 in the absence of the IFN-alpha/beta response. This provides the first evidence that viruses may not induce IRF-1 directly. Finally, nonmyocarditic reovirus strains induced more cardiac lesions in mice deficient for IRF-1 than they did in wildtype mice, directly demonstrating a protective role for IRF-1. Together, the results indicate that while IRF-1 is downstream of the IFN-beta response, it plays an important protective role against viral myocarditis.
12396725	Absence of PKR attenuates the anti-HSV-1 activity of an adenoviral vector expressing murine IFN-beta.	A study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of an adenoviral vector containing the murine interferon-beta (IFN-beta) transgene (Ad:IFN-beta) against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection in two transduced cell lines. The transduction of the adenoviral vector efficiency, ranging from 2% to 100%, was dependent on the multiplicity of infection (moi) (0.4-50 plaque-forming units [pfu]/cell). Supernatants from cells transduced with the Ad:IFN-beta but not the adenoviral null vector (Ad:Null) contained biologically active IFN-beta (6.6-106 U/ml depending on the moi). Cells transduced with the Ad:IFN-beta displayed up to 25-fold reduction in viral titers compared with cells transduced with the Ad:Null or nontransduced cell controls. The suppression in viral titer correlated with a reduction in viral gene (alpha, beta, and gamma) and protein expression. The expression of IFN beta-responsive genes, including protein kinase R (PKR) and 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), were significantly elevated in the Ad:IFN-beta-transduced cells by 12-fold and 25-fold, respectively. However, after infection with HSV-1, a transient but significant drop in PKR but not OAS gene expression was observed 10 h postinfection. The absence of PKR but not RNase L significantly attenuated the antiviral efficacy of the transgene. Collectively, these results illustrate the feasibility of employing a viral vector to deliver a potent antiviral gene to targeted cells without any obvious detriment to the vector itself and support an important role for PKR as a mediator of the anti-HSV-1 activity of type I IFN.
12794720	Endogenous levels of mRNA for IFNs and IFN-related genes in hepatic biopsies of chronic HCV-infected and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis patients.	To investigate the intra-hepatic activation of the IFN system in patients affected by chronic HCV-infection in comparison with that observed in a non-infectious liver disease such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, we measured the liver steady state mRNA levels of interferon-alpha, interferon-beta and interferon-gamma as well as of IFN-related genes (IFNAR-1, STAT1alpha, PKR, 2-5 AS, IRF-1, ICE and IL-18). In HCV-infected subjects, possible correlations of these parameters with viral load and liver injury were also analyzed. Twenty-four chronic untreated HCV-infected subjects and seven patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis were enrolled in the study. Liver biopsies were graded according to Knodell scores. Intra-hepatic mRNA levels of IFNs and related genes were assessed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. In comparison with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, in HCV-infected subjects IFN-alpha and -beta mRNA levels were significantly lower, whereas IFN-gamma, IFNAR-1, STAT1alpha IRF-1, and IL-18 mRNA were upregulated. Moreover, IFN-gamma mRNA steady state levels were correlated positively with those of IFNAR-1, IRF-1, and IL-18, suggesting a coordinated induction of these genes. Although plasma viral load was correlated inversely with IL-18-specific mRNA, viral load was not related to liver injury. IFN-gamma and IRF-1 mRNA levels were correlated positively with ALT, but not with the grading or staging. Conversely, IFN-alpha and -beta mRNA levels were higher in livers with lower staging scores. These findings support the hypothesis that in chronic HCV infection there is an imbalance between an upregulated IFN-gamma system and a downregulated IFN-alpha and -beta system, probably due to a mixed effect exerted by HCV-specific and inflammatory non-specific factors.
12898702	Phagocytosis of apoptotic inflammatory cells by microglia and its therapeutic implications: termination of CNS autoimmune inflammation and modulation by interferon-beta.	Apoptosis of autoaggressive T-cells in the CNS is an effective, noninflammatory mechanism for the resolution of T-cell infiltrates, contributing to clinical recovery in T-cell-mediated neuroinflammatory diseases. The clearance of apoptotic leukocytes by tissue-specific phagocytes is critical in the resolution of the inflammatory infiltrate and leads to a profound downregulation of phagocyte immune functions. Adult human microglia from surgically removed normal brain tissue was used in a standardized, light-microscopic in vitro phagocytosis assay of apoptotic autologous peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells (MNCs). Microglia from five different patients had a high capacity for the uptake of apoptotic MNCs in contrast to nonapoptotic target cells with the phagocytosis rate for nonapoptotic MNCs amounting to only 61.6% of the apoptotic MNCs. A newly described phosphatidylserine receptor, critical in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages, is also expressed at similar levels on human microglia. The effects of the therapeutically used immunomodulatory agent interferon-beta (IFNbeta) were investigated using Lewis rat microglia and apoptotic, encephalitogenic, myelin basic protein-specific autologous T-cells. Also, rat microglia had a high capacity to phagocytose apoptotic T-cells specifically. IFNbeta increased the phagocytosis of apoptotic T-cells to 36.8% above the untreated controls. The enhanced phagocytic activity was selective for apoptotic T-cells and was not mediated by increased IL-10 secretion. Apoptotic inflammatory cells may be efficiently and rapidly removed by microglial cells in the autoimmune-inflamed human CNS. The in vitro increase of phagocytosis by IFNbeta merits further investigations whether this mechanism could also be therapeutically exploited.
7676626	Viral infection of macrophages profoundly alters requirements for induction of nitric oxide synthesis.	Activated mouse macrophages can produce high levels of nitric oxide, an antimicrobial effector molecule recently also implicated in antiviral defense. As viral infection may alter macrophage functions, nitric oxide production was investigated in murine macrophages infected with a Flavivirus, tick-borne encephalitis virus. Infected macrophages produced high levels of nitric oxide upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide without priming, while in control macrophages induction of nitric oxide production by lipopolysaccharide required priming with interferon-gamma. Addition of interferon-gamma to infected macrophages further increased lipopolysaccharide-stimulated nitric oxide production. In contrast, nitric oxide production upon stimulation with interferon-gamma plus tumor necrosis factor-alpha was markedly reduced in infected macrophages. Downregulation of interferon-gamma plus tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced nitric oxide synthesis by viral infection could be attributed to endogenous interferon-alpha beta produced by infected macrophages. Addition of interferon-alpha beta to uninfected macrophages inhibited interferon-gamma plus tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced nitric oxide production, and addition of interferon-alpha beta antibodies to infected macrophages increased identically stimulated nitric oxide production to normal levels. Thus, interferon-alpha beta mimicked the effect of viral infection on macrophage nitric oxide production. These findings indicate that viral infection profoundly alters requirements of mouse macrophages for induction of nitric oxide synthesis, depending on the activating signal applied. The described effects of viral infection of macrophages on the regulation of nitric oxide production and new complexity to the role of nitric oxide in host defense against viruses.
10518019	Knockout of the Sendai virus C gene eliminates the viral ability to prevent the interferon-alpha/beta-mediated responses.	Sendai virus (SeV) renders cells unresponsive to interferon (IFN)-alpha. To identify viral factors involved in this process, we examined whether recombinant SeVs, which could not express V protein, subsets of C proteins (C, C', Y1 and Y2) or any of four C proteins, retained the capability of impeding IFN-alpha-mediated responses. Among these viruses, only the 4C knockout virus completely lost the ability to suppress the induction of IFN-alpha-stimulated gene products and the subsequent establishment of an anti-viral state. These findings reveal crucial roles of the SeV C proteins in blocking IFN-alpha-mediated responses.
10936102	Mouse adenovirus type 1 replication in vitro is resistant to interferon.	The effects of mouse interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta and recombinant IFN-gamma on mouse adenovirus type 1 (MAV-1) replication were investigated in single-cycle infectious virus yield reduction assays on mouse L929 cells. Viral yields at 3 days postinfection indicated that wt MAV-1 and pmE314, an early region 3 null mutant, were relatively insensitive to both IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma, whereas early region 1A (E1A) mutants pmE109 (null), dlE105 (conserved region 1 deletion, CR1 Delta), dlE102 (CR2 Delta), and dlE106 (CR3 Delta) were sensitive. MAV-1 E1A that was inducibly expressed in mouse fibroblast 37.1 cells rescued vesicular stomatitis virus from the antiviral effect of IFN-alpha/beta but not from the antiviral effect of IFN-gamma. Interferon-inducible gene expression was reduced in 37.1 cells as compared to the parental 3T6 cell line. Steady-state levels of IFN-inducible gene mRNAs were also reduced in 3T6 cells infected with the wild-type virus and pmE314 but not in cells infected with pmE109. These results suggest that the MAV-1 E1A gene product is capable of interfering with the signaling pathways of both types of IFN, although modulation of IFN-alpha/beta antiviral activity was more pronounced.
11371761	Interferon-beta in multiple sclerosis: altering the balance of interleukin-12 and interleukin-10?	Interferon-beta is a remarkably pleiotropic molecule. Antiviral, pro- and antiproliferative, pro- and antiapoptotic, and complex immunoregulatory activities have all been described. The precise mechanism(s) that underlie the beneficial effects of interferon-beta in multiple sclerosis remain poorly understood; this has hindered progress in the search for more effective therapies. An increasing body of literature supports the hypothesis that interferon-beta-mediated changes in the production and activities of the immunoregulatory cytokines interleukin-12 and interleukin-10 are important to the therapeutic benefits of interferon-beta in multiple sclerosis. These data are reviewed here.
11803186	Effect of interferon-beta-1b on cognitive functions in multiple sclerosis.	INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is recognised as a central nervous system disease also affecting cognition. The rate of cognitive dysfunction in MS is in the range of 45-65% and adversely affect the quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of 1 year of treatment with interferon-beta-1b (IFNbeta-1b) on cognitive functions in patients suffering from relapsing-remitting MS. METHODS: A battery of cognitive tests was used to assess verbal learning, delayed recall, visual learning and recall, complex attention, concentration and verbal fluency at baseline and after 1 year of treatment with IFNbeta-1b. A group of 23 relapsing-remitting MS patients matched for neurological disability served as controls. RESULTS: Eighteen of 23 patients treated with IFNbeta-1b (74%) completed the study. In the IFNbeta-1b-treated group, complex attention, concentration as well as visual learning and recall improved significantly (p = 0.024, p = 0.006 and p = 0.005, respectively), while no deterioration was observed in the other dimensions. In the control group, complex attention, verbal fluency, as well as visual learning and recall deteriorated significantly (p = 0.02, p = 0.004 and p = 0.01, respectively), while no deterioration was observed in the other dimensions. CONCLUSION: Immunomodulating drugs that reduce the relapse rate and slow the disease progression also inhibit cognitive deterioration in patients with MS.
12482656	The V proteins of simian virus 5 and other paramyxoviruses inhibit induction of interferon-beta.	In this article we show that the paramyxovirus SV5 is a poor inducer of interferon-beta (IFN-beta). This inefficient induction is a consequence of the expression of an intact viral V protein. In the absence of the viral V protein cysteine-rich C-terminal domain, IFN-beta mRNA is strongly induced and the transcription factors NF-kappaB and IRF-3 are activated significantly. The V protein can work in isolation from SV5 to block intracellular dsRNA signaling. The mechanism of block to dsRNA signaling is distinct from that previously observed for blocking IFN signaling in that proteolysis of candidate factors cannot be detected, and furthermore, the respective blocks require distinct protein domains. Blocking of the induction of IFN-beta by dsRNA requires the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain, a feature that is highly conserved among paramyxoviruses. We demonstrate that the V proteins from other paramyxoviruses have equivalent functions and speculate that limiting the yield of IFN-beta during infection may be a general property of paramyxoviruses.
12663771	Ability of the matrix protein of vesicular stomatitis virus to suppress beta interferon gene expression is genetically correlated with the inhibition of host RNA and protein synthesis.	The vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) matrix (M) protein plays a major role in the virus-induced inhibition of host gene expression. It has been proposed that the inhibition of host gene expression by M protein is responsible for suppressing activation of host interferon gene expression. Most wild-type (wt) strains of VSV induce little if any interferon gene expression. Interferon-inducing mutants of VSV have been isolated previously, many of which contain mutations in their M proteins. However, it was not known whether these M protein mutations were responsible for the interferon-inducing phenotype of these viruses. Alternatively, mutations in other genes besides the M gene may enhance the ability of VSV to induce interferons. These hypotheses were tested by transfecting cells with mRNA expressing wt and mutant M proteins in the absence of other viral components and determining their ability to inhibit interferon gene expression. The M protein mutations were the M51R mutation originally found in the tsO82 and T1026R1 mutant viruses, the double substitution V221F and S226R found in the TP3 mutant virus, and the triple substitution E213A, V221F, and S226R found in the TP2 mutant virus. wt M proteins suppressed expression of luciferase from the simian virus 40 promoter and from the beta interferon (IFN-beta) promoter, while M proteins of interferon-inducing viruses were unable to inhibit luciferase expression from either promoter. The M genes of the interferon-inducing mutants of VSV were incorporated into the wt background of a recombinant VSV infectious cDNA clone. The resulting recombinant viruses were tested for their ability to activate interferon gene expression and for their ability to inhibit host RNA and protein synthesis. Each of the recombinant viruses containing M protein mutations induced expression of a luciferase reporter gene driven by the IFN-beta promoter and induced production of interferon bioactivity more effectively than viruses containing wt M proteins. Furthermore, the M protein mutant viruses were defective in their ability to inhibit both host RNA synthesis and host protein synthesis. These data support the idea that wt M protein suppresses interferon gene expression through the general inhibition of host RNA and protein synthesis.
9282915	Interferon-beta is a potent promoter of nerve growth factor production by astrocytes.	Recent clinical evidence has suggested that interferon-beta is efficacious in the treatment of the demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis. The mechanism of its efficacy remains unclear, and suggested modes of action have focused on immune modulation. Nonimmune effects of interferon-beta may also contribute to its efficacy. Given that astrocytes produce a range of neurotrophic factors, we examined the possibility that interferon-beta could increase the astrocytic production of nerve growth factor (NGF), which has been reported to cause oligodendrocytes to proliferate and to extend their processes; these phenotypes can impact favorably on remyelination. When the recombinant form of mouse interferon-beta was added to mouse astrocyte cultures, a dose-dependent increase in NGF mRNA was obtained. The 40-fold increase in NGF mRNA elicited by 1,000 U/ml interferon-beta was far more potent than that produced by other NGF-elevating agents in this study. In concordance, the protein for NGF was elevated by interferon-beta. The production of NGF by interferon-beta may be relevant to its clinical efficacy in multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, we suggest the potential utility of interferon-beta in Alzheimer's disease.
9345389	Interferon beta in the cytokine network: an anti-inflammatory pathway.	Interferons are cytokines and thus fulfil a vital role in communication between cells in their microenvironment. Type I interferons, the group to which interferon beta (IFN-beta) belongs, share several structural and functional properties by which they distinguish themselves from type II interferon or IFN-gamma. In particular, IFN-beta can be produced by many different cells while IFN-gamma is an exclusively lymphocytic cytokine, i.e. a lymphokine. IFN-beta is functionally linked to other cytokines as it can induced by some of them (e.g. interleukin I) and as its actions can be potentiated or antagonized by other cytokines. Such interactions can take place at several levels, e.g. at the level of signal transduction and transcription activation. Of potential interest for the role of IFN-beta in multiple sclerosis is its ability to function as a deactivator of mononuclear phagocytes, and hence as an inhibitor of inflammation.
9448289	The polyoma virus T antigen interferes with interferon-inducible gene expression.	Murine polyoma virus (MPyV) is a small DNA virus that induces tumors in multiple tissues of infected host. In this investigation, we show that cell lines derived from wild type virus-induced breast tumors are resistant to the growth inhibitory action of interferon beta (IFN-beta). Furthermore, replication of heterologous viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus and encephalomyocarditis virus was not inhibited by IFN-beta in these cells. This effect was due to inhibition of IFN-stimulated gene expression by viral T antigen. Activation of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 was inhibited in cells derived from a tumor induced by wild-type MPyV but not those from a mutant that lacks the pRB binding site of the large T antigen. Similarly IFN-gamma-inducible gene expression was also inhibited in cells transformed by wild-type virus. The levels of components of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 and signal transducing Janus tyrosine kinases were comparable between the cells transformed by the wild-type and mutant viruses. The viral large T antigen bound to Janus tyrosine kinase 1 and inactivated signaling through IFN receptors. Thus, these studies identify a mechanism of viral resistance to IFN action.
10378864	Cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities in a phase III trial of Avonex (IFNbeta-1a) for relapsing multiple sclerosis. The Multiple Sclerosis Collaborative Research Group.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This report provides results of CSF analyses done in a subset of relapsing remitting MS patients participating in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase III clinical trial of IFNbeta-Studies supported by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (grants RG2019, RG2827),a (Avonex , Biogen). The clinical trial demonstrated that IFNbeta-1a treatment resulted in significantly reduced disability progression, annual relapse rate, and new brain lesions visualized by cranial magnetic resonance imaging. The objectives of the current study were to determine: (a) whether CSF abnormalities in MS patients correlated with disease or MRI characteristics, and (b) effects of IFNbeta-1a therapy on these CSF abnormalities. METHODS: CSF was analyzed from 262 (87%) of the 301 study subjects at entry into the clinical trial, and a second CSF sample was analyzed from 137 of these 262 subjects after 2 years of therapy. CSF cell counts, oligoclonal bands (OCB), IgG index, and free kappa light chains were measured using standard assays. Baseline CSF results were compared with demographic, disease, and MRI parameters. Differences in on-study relapse rate, gadolinium enhancement, and EDSS change according to baseline CSF status was used to determine the predictive value of CSF for subsequent clinical and MRI disease activity. Change in CSF parameters after 104 weeks were used to determine the effects of treatment. RESULTS: (1) At study baseline, 37% of the subjects had abnormal CSF WBC counts, 61% had abnormal levels of CSF free kappa light chains, 84% had abnormal IgG index values, and 90% were positive for OCB. (2) Baseline IgG index, kappa light chains, and OCB showed weakly positive, statistically significant correlations with Gd-enhanced lesion volume and T2 lesion volume. WBC showed a statistically significant correlation with Gd-enhancing lesion volume but was uncorrelated with T2 lesion volume. (3) There was an associated between baseline CSF WBC counts and on-study clinical and MRI disease activity in placebo recipients. (4) IFNbeta-1a treatment resulted in significantly reduced CSF WBC counts, but there was no treatment-related change in CSF IgG index, kappa light chains, or OCB, which remained relatively stable over time in both patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: The current study documents significant reductions in CSF WBC counts in patients treated with IFNbeta-1a for 104 weeks. This finding is considered relevant to the therapeutic response, since CSF WBC counts were found to be positively correlated with subsequent clinical and MRI disease activity in placebo-treated relapsing MS patients.
11133491	Reovirus triggers cell type-specific proinflammatory responses dependent on the autocrine action of IFN-beta.	Resident cells of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, including epithelial and fibroblast cells, are the initial sites of entry for many viral pathogens. We investigated the role that these cells play in the inflammatory process in response to infection with reovirus 1/L. In A549 human bronchial or HT-29 human colonic epithelial cells, interferon (IFN)-beta, regulated on activation T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), IFN-gamma-inducible protein (IP)-10, and interleukin-8 were upregulated regardless of whether cells were infected with replication-competent or replication-deficient reovirus 1/L. However, in CCD-34Lu human lung fibroblast cells, IFN-beta, IP-10, and RANTES were expressed only after infection with replication-competent reovirus 1/L. Expression of interleukin-8 in CCD-34Lu fibroblast cells was viral replication independent. This differential expression of IFN-beta, RANTES, and IP-10 was shown to be due to the lack of induction of IFN regulatory factor-1 and -2 in CCD-34Lu fibroblast cells treated with replication-deficient reovirus 1/L. We have shown that cytokine and/or chemokine expression may not be dependent on viral replication. Therefore, treatment of viral infections with inhibitors of replication may not effectively alleviate inflammatory mediators because most viral infections result in the generation of replication-competent and replication-deficient virions in vivo.
11152483	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) virion and covalently closed circular DNA formation in primary tupaia hepatocytes and human hepatoma cell lines upon HBV genome transduction with replication-defective adenovirus vectors.	Hepatitis B virus (HBV), the causative agent of B-type hepatitis in humans, is a hepatotropic DNA-containing virus that replicates via reverse transcription. Because of its narrow host range, there is as yet no practical small-animal system for HBV infection. The hosts of the few related animal viruses, including woodchuck hepatitis B virus and duck hepatitis B virus, are either difficult to keep or only distantly related to humans. Some evidence suggests that tree shrews (tupaias) may be susceptible to infection with human HBV, albeit with low efficiency. Infection efficiency depends on interactions of the virus with factors on the surface and inside the host cell. To bypass restrictions during the initial entry phase, we used recombinant replication-defective adenovirus vectors, either with or without a green fluorescent protein marker gene, to deliver complete HBV genomes into primary tupaia hepatocytes. Here we show that these cells, like the human hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and Huh7, are efficiently transduced by the vectors and produce all HBV gene products required to generate the secretory antigens HBsAg and HBeAg, replication-competent nucleocapsids, and enveloped virions. We further demonstrate that covalently closed circular HBV DNA is formed. Therefore, primary tupaia hepatocytes support all steps of HBV replication following deposition of the genome in the nucleus, including the intracellular amplification cycle. These data provide a rational basis for in vivo experiments aimed at developing tupaias into a useful experimental animal system for HBV infection.
8770778	An open-labelled assessment of adverse effects associated with interferon 1-beta in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.	Interferon 1-beta (IFNB) (Betaseron) has been reported to reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Adverse effects from this every other day injection are frequent, and most often include injection site reaction or flu-like symptoms. This open-labelled prospective study of MS patients receiving IFNB found that while injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms were seen in 90.0% and 76.7% of patients respectively, only two of 30 patients discontinued therapy for these problems.
9637519	Influenza A virus-induced IFN-alpha/beta and IL-18 synergistically enhance IFN-gamma gene expression in human T cells.	T cells contribute significantly the to host's early defense against viral and bacterial infections and are essential for clearance of the pathogen. IFN-gamma, a product of activated T and NK cells, has, in addition to its direct antimicrobial activity, a major role in activating cell-mediated immunity. Here we report that cytokines secreted by influenza A virus-infected macrophages are able to induce IFN-gamma synthesis in human T cells. Influenza A virus-infected human peripheral macrophages secreted IFN-alpha/beta, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and a recently identified cytokine, IL-18 (or IFN-gamma-inducing factor), whereas the production of IL-12 was not detected. Supernatants collected from virus-infected macrophages induced rapid IFN-gamma mRNA expression and protein production in T cells. This was down-regulated by the addition of neutralizing anti-IFN-alpha/beta Abs, whereas neutralizing anti-IL-12 Abs had no effect on IFN-gamma gene expression. Exogenously added IFN-alpha/beta also rapidly stimulated the synthesis of IFN-gamma mRNA in T cells independently of protein synthesis. IL-18 synergized with IFN-alpha to up-regulate IFN-gamma gene expression and protein production. The data suggest that IFN-alpha/beta and IL-18 produced by macrophages during virus infection may act together to induce IFN-gamma synthesis and, consequently, may play an important role for both of these cytokines in the development of Th1-type immune responses.
10996401	Protective effects of murine recombinant interferon-beta administered by intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous route on mouse hepatitis virus infection.	The significance of the route for administration of murine recombinant interferon-beta (IFN-beta) for inducing its therapeutic effects has been studied. BALB/c mice were daily injected intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously with 1.5x10(3), 1. 5x10(4), or 1.5x10(5) IU of IFN-beta, from one day before to 8th day after mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-2) challenge. All mice received IFN-beta survived significantly longer than those without IFN. In the liver of those IFN-treated mice, viral growth and the histopathological damages were extremely alleviated. These results suggest that, irrespective of the differences in the route of administration, IFN-beta markedly suppressed viral activity when its administration was started prior to viral infection. For clinical use, however, further studies are needed on the optimal route for administration if IFN-beta is given after viral infection.
11021600	Multiple systemic expression of human interferon-beta in mice can be achieved upon repeated administration of optimized pcTG90-lipoplex.	The possibility of achieving multiple systemic expression of human interferon-beta in mice upon repeated intravenous administration of cationic liposome-DNA complex (lipoplex) was investigated. Lipoplexes containing the pentammonio lipid pcTG90 were first optimized by selecting the most efficient ratio of pcTG90 to phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) and the N/P ratio of cationic lipid nitrogen to DNA phosphate. Highest levels and reproducibility of gene expression were obtained using pcTG90/DOPE (1:2) liposomes complexed with the IFNB1 gene containing plasmid pTG14169 at a N/P ratio of 10. Following lipoplex administration, an early but transient human interferon-beta expression in serum was observed. Importantly, repeated systemic gene expression could be achieved upon re-administration with a minimal time interval of 14 days between two injections. For an interval period of 6 days, subsequent gene expression was inhibited by a first administration of lipoplexes containing either a luciferase reporter gene plasmid or an empty plasmid, but was not inhibited when free (non-complexed) plasmid pTG14169 was first injected. Multiple injections of pcTG90-lipoplex performed once every other month resulted in three subsequent peaks of systemic IFNB1 gene expression in mice. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the feasibility of expanding the therapeutic window of a cytokine using repetitive intravenous administration of lipoplex.
12465460	HIV-1 replication.	"In general terms, the replication cycle of lentiviruses, including HIV-1, closely resembles that of other retroviruses. There are, however, a number of unique aspects of HIV replication; for example, the HIVs and SIVs target receptors and coreceptors distinct from those used by other retroviruses. Lentiviruses encode a number of regulatory and accessory proteins not encoded by the genomes of the prototypical ""simple"" retroviruses. Of particular interest from the gene therapy perspective, lentiviruses possess the ability to productively infect some types of non-dividing cells. This chapter, while reiterating certain points discussed in Chapter 1, will attempt to focus on issues unique to HIV-1 replication. The HIV-1 genome encodes the major structural and non-structural proteins common to all replication-competent retroviruses (Fig. 1, and Chapter 1). From the 5'- to 3'-ends of the genome are found the gag (for group-specific antigen), pol (for polymerase), and env (for envelope glycoprotein) genes. The gag gene encodes a polyprotein precursor whose name, Pr55Gag, is based on its molecular weight. Pr55Gag is cleaved by the viral protease (PR) to the mature Gag proteins matrix (also known as MA or p17), capsid (CA or p24), nucleocapsid (NC or p7), and p6. Two spacer peptides, p2 and p1, are also generated upon Pr55Gag processing. The pol-encoded enzymes are initially synthesized as part of a large polyprotein precursor, Pr160GagPol, whose synthesis results from a rare frameshifting event during Pr55Gag translation. The individual pol-encoded enzymes, PR, reverse transcriptase (RT), and integrase (IN), are cleaved from Pr160GagPol by the viral PR. The envelope (Env) glycoproteins are also synthesized as a polyprotein precursor (Fig. 1). Unlike the Gag and Pol precursors, which are cleaved by the viral PR, the Env precursor, known as gp160, is processed by a cellular protease during Env trafficking to the cell surface, gp160 processing results in the generation of the surface (SU) Env glycoprotein gp120 and the transmembrane (TM) glycoprotein gp41. gp120 contains the determinants that interact with receptor and coreceptor, while gp41 not only anchors the gp120/gp41 complex in the membrane (Fig. 2), but also contains domains that are critical for catalyzing the membrane fusion reaction between viral and host lipid bilayers during virus entry. Comparison of env sequences from a large number of virus isolates revealed that gp120 is organized into five conserved regions (C1-C5) and five highly variable domains (V1-V5). The variable regions tend to be located in disulfide-linked loops. gp41 is composed of three major domains: the ectodomain (which contains determinants essential for membrane fusion), the transmembrane anchor sequence, and the cytoplasmic tail. In addition to the gag, pol, and env genes, HIV-1 also encodes a number of regulatory and accessory proteins. Tat is critical for transcription from the HIV-1 LTR and Rev plays a major [figure: see text] role in the transport of viral RNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Vpu, Vif, Vpr and Nef have been termed ""accessory"" or ""auxiliary"" proteins to reflect the fact that they are not uniformly required for virus replication. The functions of these very interesting proteins will be discussed in more detail at the end of this chapter. HIV replication proceeds in a series of events that can be divided into two overall phases: ""early"" and ""late"" (Fig. 3). Although some events occur in a concerted or simultaneous fashion, the replication cycle can be viewed most simply as proceeding in an ordered, step-wise manner. In this chapter, each step in virus replication will be considered; additional information can be obtained from the more detailed reviews and primary references that are cited."
8640765	Gene deletion chemoselectivity: codeletion of the genes for p16(INK4), methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, and the alpha- and beta-interferons in human pancreatic cell carcinoma lines and its implications for chemotherapy.	Pancreatic carcinoma cells lines are known to have a high incidence of homozygous deletion of the candidate tumor suppressor gene p16 (MTS1/CDKN2), which resides in the chromosome 9p21 region. Here we: (a)examined a series of these cell lines for the incidence of codeletion of genes located near p16, in particular, the gene for the enzyme 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) and the genes of the IFN-alpha and -beta cluster (IFNs); and (b) investigated whether therapeutic strategies could be developed that target malignant cells that have undergone the codeletion of such genes. Five of the eight pancreatic carcinoma cell lines were p16(-), MTAP was codeleted in all five cases. Because MTAP phosphorolyzes 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA), generated as a byproduct of polyamine synthesis, to the salvageable purine base adenine, loss of this pathway in p16(-), MTAP(-) cells might sensitize these cells to methotrexate (MTX), the mechanism of action of which involves, in part, an inhibition of purine de novo synthesis. MTAP(+) normal keratinocytes and pancreatic carcinoma lines had relatively poor sensitivity, in terms of efficacy, to the purine nucleotide-starving actions of MTX. This may be in part due to the MTAP-dependent salvage of adenine moieties from endogenously generated MTA, because the MTAP inhibitor 5'-chloro-5'-de- oxyformycin A potentiates the antipurine actions of MTX in some of these MTAP(+) lines. Also, exogenous MTA (10 microM) reverses the growth-inhibitory actions of MTX in these lines. In contrast, MTAP(-) cell lines, which cannot recycle purines from endogenous MTA, have a relatively high sensitivity to the antipurine actions of MTX, which is not modulated by 5'-chloro-5'-deoxyformycin A or exogenous MTA. Thus the MTAP loss in malignant cells may be an example of gene deletion chemoselectivity, in which genetic deletions that occur as part of the oncogenic process render these cells more sensitive to particular anticancer agents than normal cells, which have not undergone such deletions. We also examined whether the loss of IFN genes sensitize cells to the growth-inhibitory actions of these cytokines. Three of the five p16(-) cell lines bore homozygous deletions of IFNA1 and IFNB1 genes, representing each end of the IFN-alpha,-beta gene cluster; one cell line bore a codeletion of the IFNA1 gene but retained the IFNB1 locus. Whereas the cell lines that were most sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effects of IFN-beta or IFN-alpha(2b), tended to be those with IFN deletions, there were enough exceptions to this pattern to indicate that the IFN genotype does not reliably predict IFN responsiveness.
9311862	Growth of the parvovirus minute virus of mice MVMp3 in EL4 lymphocytes is restricted after cell entry and before viral DNA amplification: cell-specific differences in virus uncoating in vitro.	Two murine parvoviruses with genomic sequences differing only in 33 nucleotides (8 amino acids) in the region coding for the capsid proteins show different host cell specificities: MVMi grows in EL4 T lymphocytes and MVMp3 grows in A9 fibroblasts. In this study we compared the courses of infections with these two viruses in EL4 cells in order to investigate at which step(s) the infection process of MVMp3 is interrupted. The two viruses bound equally well to EL4 cells, and similar amounts of MVMi and MVMp3 input virion DNA appeared in the nuclear fractions of EL4 cells 1 h after infection. However, double-stranded replicative-form (RF) DNA of the two viruses appeared at different times, at 10 h postinfection with MVMi and at 24 h postinfection with MVMp3. The amount of MVMp3 RF DNA detected at 24 h was very small because it was produced only in a tiny subset of the population of EL4 cells that proved to be permissive for MVMp3. Replication of double-stranded viral DNA in EL4 cells was measured after transfection of purified RF DNA, cloned viral DNA, and cloned viral DNA with a mutation preventing synthesis of the capsid proteins. In each of these cases, DNA replication was comparable for MVMi and MVMp3. Production of virus particles also appeared to be similar after transfection of the two types of RF DNA into EL4 cells. Conversion of incoming 32P-labeled single-stranded MVM DNA to 32P-labeled double-stranded RF DNA was detected only after RF DNA amplification, indicating that few molecules serve as templates for viral DNA amplification. We showed that extracts of EL4 cells contain a factor which can destabilize MVMi virions but not MVMp3 by testing the sensitivity of viral DNA to DNase and by CsCl gradient analyses of viral particles. We therefore conclude that the MVMp3 life cycle is arrested after the transport of virions to the nucleus and prior to the replication of RF DNA, most likely at the stage of viral decapsidation.
10567640	Characterization of aggregates of hepatitis C virus glycoproteins.	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) encodes two glycoproteins, E1 and E2, which assemble in oligomeric structures. Studies of HCV glycoprotein assembly using heterologous expression systems have shown that these glycoproteins can follow two pathways: a productive pathway leading to the formation of a non-covalent heterodimer; and a non-productive pathway leading to the formation of large disulfide-linked aggregates. The non-covalent HCV glycoprotein complex is probably the functional complex which plays an active role in the entry process in host cells. The aggregates are believed to be waste products; however, one can imagine that, in infected cells, they could provide HCV glycoproteins with additional functions. To further understand the potential role played by HCV glycoprotein aggregates in HCV infection, a MAb (H14) was produced which specifically recognizes these aggregates but not the non-covalent E1E2 heterodimer. The H14 epitope was shown to be present on both HCV glycoproteins and was sensitive to deglycosylation. An additional characterization of HCV glycoprotein aggregates, with the help of MAb H14, indicates that they share an epitope with a cellular protein called Mac-2 binding protein. The presence of such an epitope on HCV glycoprotein aggregates could potentially lead to the production of autoantibodies recognizing Mac-2 binding protein in HCV-infected patients.
10756011	The role of alpha/beta and gamma interferons in development of immunity to influenza A virus in mice.	During influenza virus infection innate and adaptive immune defenses are activated to eliminate the virus and thereby bring about recovery from illness. Both arms of the adaptive immune system, antibody neutralization of free virus and termination of intracellular virus replication by antiviral cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), play pivotal roles in virus elimination and protection from disease. Innate cytokine responses, such as alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) or IFN-gamma, can have roles in determining the rate of virus replication in the initial stages of infection and in shaping the initial inflammatory and downstream adaptive immune responses. The effect of these cytokines on the replication of pneumotropic influenza A virus in the respiratory tract and in the regulation of adaptive antiviral immunity was examined after intranasal infection of mice with null mutations in receptors for IFN-alpha/beta, IFN-gamma, and both IFNs. Virus titers in the lungs of mice unable to respond to IFNs were not significantly different from congenic controls for both primary and secondary infection. Likewise the mice were comparably susceptible to X31 (H3N2) influenza virus infection. No significant disruption to the development of normal antiviral CTL or antibody responses was observed. In contrast, mice bearing the disrupted IFN-alpha/beta receptor exhibited accelerated kinetics and significantly higher levels of neutralizing antibody activity during primary or secondary heterosubtypic influenza virus infection. Thus, these observations reveal no significant contribution for IFN-controlled pathways in shaping acute or memory T-cell responses to pneumotropic influenza virus infection but do indicate some role for IFN-alpha/beta in the regulation of antibody responses. Recognizing the pivotal role of CTLs and antibody in virus clearance, it is reasonable to assume a redundancy in IFN-mediated antiviral effects in pulmonary influenza. However, IFN-alpha/beta seems to be a valid factor in determining tissue tropism and replicative rates of highly virulent influenza virus strains as reported previously by others, and this aspect is discussed here.
11741849	The lytic enzyme of bacteriophage PRD1 is associated with the viral membrane.	Bacteriophage PRD1 encodes two proteins (P7 and P15) that are associated with a muralytic activity. Protein P15 is a soluble beta-1,4-N-acetylmuramidase that causes phage-induced host cell lysis. We demonstrate here that P15 is also a structural component of the PRD1 virion and that it is connected to the phage membrane. Small viral membrane proteins P20 and P22 modulate incorporation of P15 into the virion and may connect it to the phage membrane. The principal muralytic protein involved in PRD1 DNA entry seems to be the putative lytic transglycosylase protein P7, as the absence of protein P15 did not delay initiation of phage DNA replication in the virus-host system used. The incorporation of two different lytic enzymes into virions may reflect the broad host range of bacteriophage PRD1.
12449589	Current concepts in multiple sclerosis: Part II.	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex and challenging autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, affecting approximately 0.1% of the US population. Evidence to date suggests that viral infection triggers autoimmune attack against nerve cells in genetically-susceptible individuals. Neurologic deficits then appear, typically with a variable course and episodes of remission. Partial treatment success has been obtained with immunomodulating agents, such as interferon-beta and intravenous immunoglobulins. Current research is directed at elucidating potential viral causes of MS, as well as the interaction of host genes with the immunopathogenic mechanisms involved in MS. In the future, it may be possible to vaccinate susceptible individuals against MS, as well as refine immunomodulation therapy for the treatment of MS.
12872134	Integration of interferon-alpha/beta signalling to p53 responses in tumour suppression and antiviral defence.	Swift elimination of undesirable cells is an important feature in tumour suppression and immunity. The tumour suppressor p53 and interferon-alpha and -beta (IFN-alpha/beta) are essential for the induction of apoptosis in cancerous cells and in antiviral immune responses, respectively, but little is known about their interrelationship. Here we show that transcription of the p53 gene is induced by IFN-alpha/beta, accompanied by an increase in p53 protein level. IFN-alpha/beta signalling itself does not activate p53; rather, it contributes to boosting p53 responses to stress signals. We show examples in which p53 gene induction by IFN-alpha/beta contributes to tumour suppression. Furthermore, we show that p53 is activated in virally infected cells to evoke an apoptotic response and that p53 is critical for antiviral defence of the host. Our study reveals a hitherto unrecognized link between p53 and IFN-alpha/beta in tumour suppression and antiviral immunity, which may have therapeutic implications.
10636147	Mx proteins in blood leukocytes for monitoring interferon beta-1b therapy in patients with MS.	OBJECTIVE: To correlate Mx protein (Mx) levels in lysed blood leukocytes with the clinical response to interferon (IFN) beta-1b (IFNbeta-1b) in relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS) patients for monitoring treatment. BACKGROUND: Intracellular Mx expression is exclusively induced by the type I IFNs (IFN-alpha, -beta, and -omega) or by viruses and is strongly increased under IFN treatment. Quantitative determination of Mx allows objective assessment of biological effects of IFN. METHODS: Mx protein levels were measured in blood leukocyte lysates from IFNbeta-1b-treated RR-MS patients by ELISA and correlated to clinical parameters, including relapse rate and clinical deterioration. RESULTS: In stable IFNbeta-1b-treated MS patients, Mx levels were significantly increased compared to patients with or without immunosuppressive treatment. In IFN-1b-treated MS patients during relapse, Mx levels were significantly lower than during stable phases of the disease. Mean values of Mx (MVMx) over time of treatment in patients with a reduction of relapse rate were significantly higher than in patients without response. CONCLUSION: Mx levels in lysed blood cells may represent a useful surrogate marker for IFNbeta-1b activity corresponding to the clinical response during treatment of MS.
11134323	The vhs1 mutant form of herpes simplex virus virion host shutoff protein retains significant internal ribosome entry site-directed RNA cleavage activity.	The virion host shutoff (vhs) protein of herpes simplex virus (HSV) triggers global shutoff of host protein synthesis and accelerated turnover of host and viral mRNAs during HSV infection. As well, it induces endoribonucleolytic cleavage of RNA substrates when produced in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) in vitro translation system. The vhs1 point mutation (Thr 214-->Ile) eliminates vhs function during virus infection and in transiently transfected mammalian cells and was therefore previously considered to abolish vhs activity. Here we demonstrate that the vhs1 mutant protein induces readily detectable endoribonuclease activity on RNA substrates bearing the internal ribosome entry site of encephalomyocarditis virus in the RRL assay system. These data document that the vhs1 mutation does not eliminate catalytic activity and raise the possibility that the vhs-dependent endoribonuclease employs more than one mode of substrate recognition.
11258568	High viral eradication with a daily 12-week natural interferon-beta treatment regimen in chronic hepatitis C patients with low viral load. IFN-beta Research Group.	Virological sustained response (SR) is achieved in 31-49% of patients with chronic hepatitis C with combination therapy using interferon (IFN)-alpha and ribavirin for 24-48 weeks. However, as a period of 24-48 weeks is a burden for patients, we investigated the effect of daily intravenous administration of natural IFN-beta for 12 weeks in this study. In all, 112 patients were enrolled and received a daily administration of 6 MU of natural IFN-beta intravenously for 12 weeks. Serum HCV-RNA before treatment was assessed by the competitive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. The patients were divided into two groups according to pretreatment viral load: the low viral load group (N = 25, <6.3 x 10(5) copies/ml), and the high viral load group (N = 87, > or =6.3 x 10(5) copies/ml) who were additionally administered IFN-beta thrice weekly for subsequent 14 weeks at the patients' request. Virological SR was obtained in 37% (41/112) of all the patients; 88% of those with a low viral load, and 22% of patients with a high viral load. Virological SR was attained in 21% of patients with HCV subtype 1, and in 67% of those with subtype 2a. In patients with HCV subtype 1b, virological SR was obtained in patients with the mutant-type (> or =4 amino acid mutations in the NSSA2209-48) having a low viral load (4/4), but not in those having a high viral load (0/3). The results suggest that a daily intravenous administration of natural IFN-beta for 12 weeks showed high therapeutic efficacy in patients with a low viral load despite the shorter treatment period and that the therapeutic efficacy depends on viral load rather than on the number of NS5A2209-48 amino acid mutations.
8637876	Baculovirus-mediated gene transfer into mammalian cells.	This paper describes the use of the baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) as a vector for gene delivery into mammalian cells. A modified AcMNPV virus was prepared that carried the Escherichia coli lacZ reporter gene under control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter and mammalian RNA processing signals. This modified baculovirus was then used to infect a variety of mammalian cell lines. After infection of the human liver cell lines HepG2, >25% of the cells showed high-level expression of the transduced gene. Over 70% of the cells in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes showed expression of beta-galactosidase after exposure to the virus. Cell lines from other tissues showed less or no expression of lacZ after exposure to the virus. The block to expression in less susceptible cells does not appear to result from the ability to be internalized by the target cell but rather by events subsequent to viral entry. The onset of lacZ expression occurred within 6 hr of infection in HepG2 cells and peaked 12-24 hr postinfection. Because AcMNPV is able to replicate only in insect hosts, is able to carry large (>15 kb) inserts, and is a highly effective gene delivery vehicle for primary cultures of hepatocytes, AcMNPV may be a useful vector for genetic manipulation of liver cells.
10983302	[Interferon beta and copolymer-1: mechanism of action and clinical effects in multiple sclerosis].	In the paper the review of clinical trials with interferon beta and copolimer-1 in the treatment of multiple sclerosis was presented. The effect of interferon beta and copolimer-1 on relapse frequency, disability and MRI activity has been described. The mechanism of action of interferon beta and copolimer-1 in MS was discussed.
11533154	Activation of interferon response factor-3 in human cells infected with herpes simplex virus type 1 or human cytomegalovirus.	Activation of cellular interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) after infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) was investigated. The level of ISG54-specific RNA in human fetal lung (HFL) or human foreskin (BJ) fibroblasts increased substantially after infection with either virus in the presence of cycloheximide. HSV-1 particles lacking glycoprotein D or glycoprotein H failed to induce ISG54-specific RNA synthesis, demonstrating that entry of virus particles rather than binding of virions to the cell surface was required for the effect. A DNA-binding complex that recognized an interferon-responsive sequence motif was induced upon infection with HSV-1 or HCMV in the presence of cycloheximide, and the complex was shown to contain the cell proteins interferon response factor 3 (IRF-3) and CREB-binding protein. IRF-3 was modified after infection with HSV-1 or HCMV to a form of lower electrophoretic mobility, consistent with phosphorylation. De novo transcription of viral or cellular genes was not required for the activation of IRF-3, since the effect was not sensitive to inhibition by actinomycin D. Infection of HFL fibroblasts with HSV-1 under conditions in which viral replication proceeded normally resulted in severely reduced levels of the IRF-3-containing complex, defining the activation of IRF-3 as a target for viral interference with ISG induction. In BJ fibroblasts, however, significant activation of IRF-3 was detected even when the viral gene expression program progressed to later stages, demonstrating that the degree of inhibition of the response was dependent on host cell type. As a consequence of IRF-3 activation, endogenous interferon was released from BJ cells and was capable of triggering the appropriate signal transduction pathway in both infected and uninfected cells. Activation of ISG54-specific RNA synthesis was not detected after infection of human U-373MG glioblastoma cells, showing that the induction of the response by infection is cell type dependent.
12885884	Nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS2 of bovine respiratory syncytial virus block activation of interferon regulatory factor 3.	We have previously shown that the nonstructural (NS) proteins NS1 and NS2 of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) mediate resistance to the alpha/beta interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral response. Here, we show that they, in addition, are able to prevent the induction of beta IFN (IFN-beta) after virus infection or double-stranded RNA stimulation. In BRSV-infected MDBK cells upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as MxA did not occur, although IFN signaling via JAK/STAT was found intact. In contrast, infection with recombinant BRSVs lacking either or both NS genes resulted in efficient upregulation of ISGs. Biological IFN activity and IFN-beta were detected only in supernatants of cells infected with the NS deletion mutants but not with wild-type (wt) BRSV. Subsequent analyses of IFN-beta promoter activity showed that infection of cells with the double deletion mutant BRSV DeltaNS1/2, but not with BRSV wt, resulted in a significant increase in IFN-beta gene promoter activity. Induction of the IFN-beta promoter depends on the activation of three distinct transcription factors, NF-kappaB, ATF-2/c-Jun, and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). Whereas NF-kappaB and ATF-2/c-Jun activities were readily detectable and comparable in both wt BRSV- and BRSV DeltaNS1/2-infected cells, phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of IRF-3, however, were observed only after BRSV DeltaNS1/2 infection. NS protein-mediated inhibition of IRF-3 activation and IFN induction should have considerable impact on the pathogenesis and immunogenicity of BRSV.
12951808	Inhibitors of the entry of HIV into host cells.	The development of mechanistic insight into the process by which HIV enters host cells has revealed a panoply of targets that offer considerable potential as sites for pharmacological intervention. The gp120/gp41 protein complex, expressed on the virion surface, mediates HIV entry by a process initiated by the engagement of the host cell receptor CD4. Subtle conformational changes triggered by this interaction expose elements of gp120 to the seven-transmembrane, G protein-coupled chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4 expressed on host cells, a contact that relieves constraints imposed on gp41 by gp120. This leads to a major conformational rearrangement of gp41, which results in the insertion of the fusion peptide into the host cell membrane and the assembly of the amino terminus heptad repeat into a trimeric form that is subsequently recognized by the carboxy terminal heptad repeat. The latter process leads to juxtaposition of the viral and host cell membranes, a prelude to fusion. The most prominent strategies and targets that are actively being exploited as drug discovery opportunities are inhibition of the attachment of HIV to host cells, blockade of chemokine receptors and interference with the function of gp41. Inhibitors of each of these steps in the HIV entry process with potential clinical relevance are reviewed in the context of their status in the drug development process. The most significant entity to emerge from this area of research to date is enfuvirtide, a 36-amino acid derivative that interferes with the function of gp41. Enfuvirtide is the first HIV entry inhibitor to be granted a license for marketing (it was approved in the US and Europe in March 2003), and its introduction portends the beginning of what promises to be an exciting new era of HIV therapy.
8894380	Soluble interferon-gamma receptors encoded by poxviruses.	Poxviruses encode a broad range of proteins that counteract the formidable attack of the immune response initiated in the host after infection, among which are proteins that mimic the extracellular binding domain of host cytokine receptors and are secreted from virus-infected cells. A soluble interferon-gamma receptor (IFN-gamma R) is produced early after infection and efficiently blocks the binding of IFN-gamma to cellular receptors, thus inhibiting both the anti-viral and immune functions of IFN-gamma. An IFN-gamma R is highly conserved among members of the poxvirus family, suggesting a major role in viral pathogenesis. The highly species-specific nature of the IFN system enables questions concerning the evolutionary relationship between poxviruses and their hosts to be addressed. The IFN-gamma R encoded by myxoma virus, a natural pathogen of rabbits, is specific for rabbit IFN-gamma. However, the IFN-gamma R encoded by orthopoxviruses (vaccinia, cowpox, camelpox, ectromelia) shows a novel, broad species specificity suggesting that these viruses have evolved in several species. The implications for the unknown origin and natural host(s) of vaccinia virus are discussed.
10954548	Efficient cell infection by Moloney murine leukemia virus-derived particles requires minimal amounts of envelope glycoprotein.	Retrovirus entry into cells is mediated by specific interactions between the retrovirally encoded Env envelope glycoprotein and a host cell surface receptor. Though a number of peptide motifs responsible for the structure as well as for the binding and fusion activities of Env have been identified, only a few quantitative data concerning the infection process are available. Using an inducible expression system, we have expressed various amounts of ecotropic and amphotropic Env at the surfaces of Moloney murine leukemia virus-derived vectors and assayed for the infectivity of viral particles. Contrary to the current view that numerous noncooperative Env-viral receptor interactions are required for cell infection, we report here that very small amounts of Env are sufficient for optimal infection. However, increasing Env density clearly accelerates the rate at which infectious attachment to cells occurs. Moreover, our data also show that a surprisingly small number of Env molecules are sufficient to drive infection, albeit at a reduced efficiency, and that, under conditions of low expression, Env molecules act cooperatively. These observations have important consequences for our understanding of natural retroviral infection as well as for the design of cell-targeted infection techniques involving retroviral vectors.
11197304	The interferon gene cluster: a candidate region for MS predisposition? Multiple Sclerosis Study Group.	The clinical benefits of interferon (IFN) beta therapy in some multiple sclerosis (MS) patients are still unexplained, raising the question whether polymorphism within the IFNB gene itself would provide an explanation. Screening the IFNB gene by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and sequencing, a single nucleotide polymorphism was identified. Both alleles were distributed with similar frequencies in MS patients and controls. Significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the IFN allele [153C] and allele [02] of the previously analyzed IFNA microsatellite (Epplen et al. Ann Neurol 1997; 41: 341-352) was observed in MS patients only, indicating a disease related haplotype. On the other hand an increased risk (RR = 12.41; Pc < 8 x 10(-5)) was observed for allele [07]. Hence the study was extended to neighbouring genes. Functionally relevant polymorphisms, i.e., premature stop codons in the IFNA10 [Cys20Stop] and IFNA17 [58Stop] genes and an aminoacid (aa) substitution [ile 184Arg] in the IFNA17 gene were analyzed. Patients carrying a non-functional IFNA17 allele bear an increased risk to develop MS (RR = 25.68; Pc < 0.06). In addition, LD analysis between IFNA10 [Cys20Stop], IFNA17 [58Stop] and the IFNA microsatellite alleles provides evidence for IFNA14, IFNA16 or IFNA5 as additional, most likely candidate genes. The present study excludes the IFNB gene as a candidate for MS predisposition but provides first evidence for predisposing IFNA genes.
11940252	Different effects of rat interferon alpha, beta and gamma on rat hepatic stellate cell proliferation and activation.	BACKGROUND: Liver fibrosis is the common sequel of chronic liver diseases. Recent studies have identified hepatic stellate cells as the primary cell type mediating hepatic fibrogenesis. It has been demonstrated that hepatic stellate cells undergo a process of activation during the development of liver fibrosis. During the activation process, hepatic stellate cells acquire myofibroblast-like phenotype featuring the expression of smooth muscle alpha actin. Interferons have been employed for the treatment of viral hepatitis. However, it is unclear what is the effect of interferons on the prevention and treatment of liver fibrosis. Moreover, it is not clear whether there are any differences among interferon alpha, interferon beta, and interferon gamma in the treatment of liver fibrosis. Therefore, our objective in current study is to investigate the effects of rat interferon-alpha, interferon-beta, and interferon-gamma on the proliferation and activation of rat hepatic stellate cells. RESULTS: Rat interferon-beta and interferon-gamma significantly inhibited rat hepatic stellate cell proliferation while rat interferon-alpha did not affect the cell proliferation under the same culture condition. Inhibition of cell proliferation was confirmed by both WST-1 cell proliferation assay and 5-bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine incorporation assay. Similar results were observed regarding interferons regulation of hepatic stellate cell activation. Both rat interferon-beta and interferon-gamma reduced smooth muscle alpha-actin abundance after 6 days treatment, but rat interferon-alpha did not alter smooth muscle alpha-actin level. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that rat interferon-alpha and interferon-beta have different biological effects on rat hepatic stellate cells and suggest that there are different signaling events between interferon-alpha and interferon-beta in hepatic stellate cells.
11952145	Activation and inhibition of virus and interferon: the herpesvirus story.	Viral infection of a host leads to induction of an immune system attack against the virus along with a counterattack by the virus against the host. Interferons are highly upregulated upon viral infection and function as key regulators of the host innate defense system. Whereas many RNA viruses are sensitive to the effects of interferon, several of the large DNA viruses are relatively resistant, given their capacity to encode proteins that disarms the host response. The herpesvirus family is a large and diverse family of viruses that infects vertebrates and invertebrates and possesses the ability to remain latent in their host for life. This paper summarizes the relationship between herpesviruses and interferon, including the ability of herpesviruses to induce interferon production, mechanisms by which interferon decreases herpesvirus replication, and strategies of herpesviruses to counteract these mechanisms.
10848617	Herpes simplex virus type 1 entry into host cells: reconstitution of capsid binding and uncoating at the nuclear pore complex in vitro.	During entry, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) releases its capsid and the tegument proteins into the cytosol of a host cell by fusing with the plasma membrane. The capsid is then transported to the nucleus, where it docks at the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), and the viral genome is rapidly released into the nucleoplasm. In this study, capsid association with NPCs and uncoating of the viral DNA were reconstituted in vitro. Isolated capsids prepared from virus were incubated with cytosol and purified nuclei. They were found to bind to the nuclear pores. Binding could be inhibited by pretreating the nuclei with wheat germ agglutinin, anti-NPC antibodies, or antibodies against importin beta. Furthermore, in the absence of cytosol, purified importin beta was both sufficient and necessary to support efficient capsid binding to nuclei. Up to 60 to 70% of capsids interacting with rat liver nuclei in vitro released their DNA if cytosol and metabolic energy were supplied. Interaction of the capsid with the nuclear pore thus seemed to trigger the release of the viral genome, implying that components of the NPC play an active role in the nuclear events during HSV-1 entry into host cells.
11023409	The entry of Theileria parva merozoites into bovine erythrocytes occurs by a process similar to sporozoite invasion of lymphocytes.	The entry of Theileria parva merozoites into bovine erythrocytes in vivo is described and compared to sporozoite invasion of lymphocytes. Merozoites make initial contact with erythrocytes with any part of their surface and invasion of the host cell does not require the re-orientation of the apical end of the merozoite towards the surface of the erythrocyte. After the initial attachment the merozoite and host cell membranes form a continual close junction with the two apposed membranes separated by a 6-8 nm gap containing moderately dense material. The progressive circumferential 'zippering' of these closely apposed membranes leads to the movement of the parasite into the erythrocyte. The newly internalized merozoite which is completely surrounded by the erythrocyte plasma membrane escapes from this enclosing membrane by a process involving the discharge of at least the rhoptries; whether the merozoite also contain other types of secretory organelles (e.g. micronemes, microspheres or dense bodies) remains to be determined. Morphologically, the events involved in merozoite invasion of erythrocytes are almost identical to the process of sporozoite invasion of lymphocytes but differ significantly from the entry process of the invasive stages of other Apicomplexan parasites.
11672543	Lymphotoxins and cytomegalovirus cooperatively induce interferon-beta, establishing host-virus détente.	Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related cytokines regulate cell death and survival and provide strong selective pressures for viruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), to evolve counterstrategies in order to persist in immune-competent hosts. Signaling by the lymphotoxin (LT)-beta receptor or TNF receptor-1, but not Fas or TRAIL receptors, inhibits the cytopathicity and replication of human CMV by a nonapoptotic, reversible process that requires nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B)-dependent induction of interferon-beta (IFN-beta). Efficient induction of IFN-beta requires virus infection and LT signaling, demonstrating the need for both host and viral factors in the curtailment of viral replication without cellular elimination. LT alpha-deficient mice and LT beta R-Fc transgenic mice were profoundly susceptible to murine CMV infection. Together, these results reveal an essential and conserved role for LTs in establishing host defense to CMV.
11298337	Human anergic/suppressive CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells: a highly differentiated and apoptosis-prone population.	Anergic/suppressive CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells exist in animal models but their presence has not yet been demonstrated in humans. We have identified and characterized a human CD4(+)CD25(+) T cell subset, which constitutes 7-10 % of CD4(+) T cells in peripheral blood and tonsil. These cells are a CD45RO(+)CD45RB(low) highly differentiated primed T cell population that is anergic to stimulation. Depletion of this small subset from CD4(+) T cells significantly enhances proliferation by threefold in the remaining CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells, while the addition of isolated CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells to CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells significantly inhibits proliferative activity. Blocking experiments suggest that suppression is not mediated via IL-4, IL-10 or TGF-beta and is cell-contact dependent. Isolated CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells are susceptible to apoptosis that is associated with low Bcl-2 expression, but this death can be prevented by IL-2 or fibroblast-secreted IFN-beta. However, the anergic/suppressive state of these cells is maintained after cytokine rescue. These human regulatory cells are therefore a naturally occurring, highly suppressive, apoptosis-prone population which are at a late stage of differentiation. Further studies into their role in normal and pathological situations in humans are clearly essential.
11352675	A CCR5/CXCR4-independent coreceptor pathway on human macrophages supports efficient SIV env-mediated fusion but not infection: implications for alternative pathways of viral entry.	Several coreceptors in addition to CCR5 and CXCR4 support immunodeficiency virus entry in transfected cells, but whether they could play a role in HIV-1 pathogenesis is uncertain. To probe whether human macrophages express potentially functional alternative entry pathways, we analyzed cell-cell fusion and infection of primary macrophage by several SIVmac Envs. All Envs fused with normal macrophages. One, SIVmac316, also fused efficiently with macrophages lacking CCR5. CCR5-independent fusion was not mediated by CXCR4 and was CD4 dependent, while CCR5-mediated fusion was partly independent of CD4. However, pseudotype virions carrying the SIVmac316 Env and HIV-1 core could not infect macrophages through the CCR5-independent pathway, although they did infect wild-type macrophages. Thus, human macrophages possess an alternative coreceptor pathway that mediates SIV Env fusion but does not support infection. Macrophage entry pathways other than CCR5 and CXCR4 may have limited potential in pathogenesis given their restricted capacity for infection despite efficient fusion.
11761225	Role of CTL host responses and their implication for tumorigenicity testing and the use of tumour cells as vaccine substrate.	Viral oncogenes, mutated cellular oncogenes, or other adventitious agents that might contaminate vaccine preparations on inoculation of the host will encounter a T cell-mediated immune response which will play a determining role in the progression of neoplastic events or replication of contaminating viral agents. Using SV40 T antigen tumour systems as a model we discuss the regions of the oncoprotein that have an impact on tumourigenicity and the role of CD8 T lymphocyte immune responses in eliminating potential tumour cells. In addition, we discuss measures that counteract T cell immune responses to abrogate T cell-mediated immunosurveillance.
12163558	Blocking of HIV-1 infection by targeting CD4 to nonraft membrane domains.	Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection depends on multiple lateral interactions between the viral envelope and host cell receptors. Previous studies have suggested that these interactions are possible because HIV-1 receptors CD4, CXCR4, and CCR5 partition in cholesterol-enriched membrane raft domains. We generated CD4 partitioning mutants by substituting or deleting CD4 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains and the CD4 ectodomain was unaltered. We report that all CD4 mutants that retain raft partitioning mediate HIV-1 entry and CD4-induced Lck activation independently of their transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Conversely, CD4 ectodomain targeting to a nonraft membrane fraction results in a CD4 receptor with severely diminished capacity to mediate Lck activation or HIV-1 entry, although this mutant binds gp120 as well as CD4wt. In addition, the nonraft CD4 mutant inhibits HIV-1 X4 and R5 entry in a CD4(+) cell line. These results not only indicate that HIV-1 exploits host membrane raft domains as cell entry sites, but also suggest new strategies for preventing HIV-1 infection.
12502864	Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-based assay demonstrates interferon-antagonist activity for the NDV V protein and the Nipah virus V, W, and C proteins.	We have generated a recombinant Newcastle disease virus (NDV) that expresses the green fluorescence protein (GFP) in infected chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs). This virus is interferon (IFN) sensitive, and pretreatment of cells with chicken alpha/beta IFN (IFN-alpha/beta) completely blocks viral GFP expression. Prior transfection of plasmid DNA induces an IFN response in CEFs and blocks NDV-GFP replication. However, transfection of known inhibitors of the IFN-alpha/beta system, including the influenza A virus NS1 protein and the Ebola virus VP35 protein, restores NDV-GFP replication. We therefore conclude that the NDV-GFP virus could be used to screen proteins expressed from plasmids for the ability to counteract the host cell IFN response. Using this system, we show that expression of the NDV V protein or the Nipah virus V, W, or C proteins rescues NDV-GFP replication in the face of the transfection-induced IFN response. The V and W proteins of Nipah virus, a highly lethal pathogen in humans, also block activation of an IFN-inducible promoter in primate cells. Interestingly, the amino-terminal region of the Nipah virus V protein, which is identical to the amino terminus of Nipah virus W, is sufficient to exert the IFN-antagonist activity. In contrast, the anti-IFN activity of the NDV V protein appears to be located in the carboxy-terminal region of the protein, a region implicated in the IFN-antagonist activity exhibited by the V proteins of mumps virus and human parainfluenza virus type 2.
8995696	The sequence element of the internal ribosome entry site and a 25-kilodalton cellular protein contribute to efficient internal initiation of translation of hepatitis C virus RNA.	Translation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA is initiated by internal entry of ribosomes into the 5' noncoding region (NCR). This process depends on genomic elements within the 5' NCR called the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and may involve host factors. The alpha-branch structure (nucleotides 47 to 67) of the HCV IRES is considered a cis-acting element critical for translation initiation because it is indispensable for translation in vitro (S. Fukushi, K. Katayama, C. Kurihara, N. Ishiyama, F. B. Hoshino, T. Ando, and A. Oya, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 199:425-432, 1994). In order to further characterize the function of the alpha-branch, we determined whether sequence exchange within the alpha-branch had any effect on translation initiation. An in vitro translation study revealed that the stem sequences of this region played an important role in efficient IRES function. In addition to several HeLa cell proteins, which had a binding affinity for the 5' NCR, a novel 25-kDa protein that specifically interacted with the HCV IRES was discovered. The binding affinity of the 25-kDa protein for the 5' NCR was correlated with the efficiency of translation initiation of HCV RNA, indicating a critical role for the 25-kDa protein in HCV translation.
9454726	Interferon treatment inhibits the replication of simian immunodeficiency virus at an early stage: evidence for a block between attachment and reverse transcription.	Interferon (IFN) dramatically reduces both SIV and HIV-1 replication in vitro. However, we previously found that whereas IFN treatment of SIV-infected cells results in a decrease in the level of viral RNA, IFN treatment of HIV-1-infected cells has no effect on viral RNA expression but rather leads to a decrease in viral protein stability and a deregulation of polyprotein processing (M. B. Agy, R. L. Acker, C. H. Sherbert, and M.G. Katze, Virology 214, 379-386, 1995). To more closely define the stage of SIV replication adversely affected by IFN, we used several approaches, including PCR amplification, to examine the effects of IFN on viral DNA synthesis and integration in MT4 and 174 x CEM cells synchronously infected with SIV. Unexpectedly, we found that IFN blocked the synthesis of viral DNA in SIV-infected cells but appeared to have no effect on HIV-1 DNA synthesis. Using a p27 ELISA, we demonstrated that IFN had no effect on the attachment of SIV to MT4 cells. Thus, our results indicate that IFN blocks an early stage of SIV replication, at a step between attachment and reverse transcription. To our knowledge this is the first report to examine the effects of IFN on discrete stages of the SIV life cycle.
9746780	Distinct regulatory mechanisms for interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta)- and IFN-gamma-mediated induction of Ly-6E gene in B cells.	The murine Ly6-E gene is transcriptionally induced by interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta) and IFN-gamma in a variety of distinct cell types. The mechanism of IFN inducibility in B-cell lines was investigated by deletion analysis of the promoter and by identifying DNA binding proteins in mobility shift assays. A region located in the distal part of the promoter at -2.3 kb contributed to inducibility by both types of IFNs. This region contains a novel element in addition to the previously well-characterized IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE). The probes containing ISRE detected IFN-inducible complexes in mobility shift assays and the signal transducer and activator of transcripition-1 was found to be in these complexes from cells treated with either type of IFN. An additional element present in the proximal part of the promoter at position -109 is also required for IFN-alpha/beta-mediated induction. These data suggested a cooperative interaction between these physically disparate regulatory regions. A crucial role for HMGI(Y) protein in this cooperative multiprotein complex is supported by the evidence that inhibition of HMGI(Y) expression via antisense RNA results in the loss of IFN-alpha/beta-mediated induction of the Ly6-E gene. These results show the complexity involved in achieving cell-type specificity in IFN-mediated gene regulation.
11032403	Early clearance of circulating hepatitis C virus enhanced by induction therapy with twice-a-day intravenous injection of IFN-beta.	To improve the long-term efficacy of interferon (IFN) for treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, we proposed induction therapy with twice-a-day IFN-beta injection. This study was intended to clarify the antiviral mechanism. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to two groups: group A (twice-a-day therapy) received 3 MU IFN-beta intravenously (i.v.) twice a day for 2 weeks; group B (once-a-day therapy) received 6 MU of IFN-beta daily. HCV RNA, IFN-beta, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 2'5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2'5'-AS) activity, and beta2-microglobulin in serum were compared between the two groups during the first 2 weeks of IFN therapy. The clearance rate of serum HCV RNA in group A (86.7%) was significantly higher than that in group B (13.3%) at day 3 (p = 0.0006). No accumulation of IFN-beta was shown in serum throughout the therapy. The ratio (day 3/day 1) of 2'5'-AS activity was significantly higher in group A. Multivariate analysis indicated twice-a-day IFN-beta injection therapy led to significantly early clearance of circulating HCV. Twice-a-day IFN-beta injection therapy could induce biologically enhanced antiviral activities and be an efficient induction therapy for eradication of HCV.
11049991	Interferon gamma and interleukin 6 modulate the susceptibility of macrophages to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection.	The effect of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) on infection of macrophages with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was investigated. By using a polymerase chain reaction-based viral entry assay and viral infectivity assay, it was demonstrated that IL-6 and IFN-gamma augmented susceptibility of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) to infection with T-cell tropic CXCR4-utilizing (X4) HIV-1 strains. Consistent with this finding, IFN-gamma and IL-6 augmented fusion of MDMs with T-tropic envelope-expressing cells. The enhanced fusion of cytokine-treated MDMs with T-tropic envelopes was inhibited by the CXCR4 ligand, SDF-1, and by T22 peptide. IFN-gamma and IL-6 did not affect expression of surface CXCR4 or SDF-1-induced Ca(++) flux in MDMs. In contrast to the effect of IFN-gamma on the infection of MDMs with X4 strains, IFN-gamma inhibited viral entry and productive infection of MDMs with macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) HIV-1. Consistent with this finding, IFN-gamma induced a decrease in fusion with M-tropic envelopes that correlated with a modest reduction in surface CCR5 and CD4 on MDMs. It was further demonstrated that macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-beta secreted by cytokine-treated MDMs augmented their fusion with T-tropic-expressing cells and inhibited their fusion with M-tropic envelope-expressing cells. These data indicate that proinflammatory cytokines, which are produced during opportunistic infections or sexually transmitted diseases, may predispose macrophages to infection with X4 strains that, in turn, could accelerate disease progression.
12482655	Recovery of paramyxovirus simian virus 5 with a V protein lacking the conserved cysteine-rich domain: the multifunctional V protein blocks both interferon-beta induction and interferon signaling.	The V protein of the Paramyxovirus simian virus 5 (SV5) is a multifunctional protein containing an N-terminal 164 residue domain that is shared with the P protein and a distinct C-terminal domain that is cysteine-rich and which is highly conserved among Paramyxoviruses. We report the recovery from Vero cells [interferon (IFN) nonproducing cells] of a recombinant SV5 (rSV5) that lacks the V protein C-terminal specific domain (rSV5VDeltaC). In Vero cells rSV5VDeltaC forms large plaques and grows at a rate and titer similar to those of rSV5. In BHK or CV-1 cells rSV5VDeltaC forms small plaques and grows poorly. However, even when grown in Vero cells rSV5VDeltaC reverts to pseudo-wild-type virus in four to five passages, indicating the importance of the V protein for successful replication of SV5. Whereas rSV5 grows in many cell types with minimal cytopathic effect (CPE), rSV5VDeltaC causes extensive CPE in the same cell types. To overcome the antiviral state induced by IFN, many viruses have evolved mechanisms to counteract the effects of IFN by blocking the production of IFN and abrogating IFN signaling. Whereas rSV5 blocks IFN signaling by mediating the degradation of STAT1, rSV5VDeltaC does not cause the degradation of STAT1 and IFN signaling occurs through formation of the ISGF3 transcription complex. Furthermore, we find that rSV5 infection of cells prevents production of IFN-beta. The transcription factor IRF-3 which is required for transcription of the IFN-beta gene is not translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in rSV5-infected cells. In contrast, in rSV5VDeltaC-infected cells IRF-3 is localized predominantly in the nucleus and IFN-beta is produced. By using ectopic expression of IRF-3, it was shown that after dsRNA treatment and expression of the V protein IRF-3 remained in the cytoplasm, whereas after dsRNA treatment and expression of the P protein (which lacks the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain) IRF-3 was localized predominantly in the nucleus. Thus, SV5 blocks two distinct pathways of the innate immune response, both of which require the presence of the C-terminal specific cysteine-rich domain of the multifunctional SV5 V protein.
9527125	Sudden deafness: lack of evidence for systemic viral infection.	The cause of sudden deafness remains unknown even though available evidence suggests that viral infection could be one factor involved. The presence of an interferon-inducible protein termed MxA in patients' leukocytes is a good marker of a systemic viral infection. This study included 20 patients with sudden deafness and 12 control subjects. Peripheral blood leukocytes obtained from the patients with sudden deafness did not express significantly higher levels of interferon-alpha/beta-inducible MxA protein than control subjects. In addition, no measurable interferon-alpha activity was detected in any of the serum specimens. These findings suggest that sudden deafness is not commonly associated with a systemic viral infection.
9748019	Serum interferon beta-1a (Avonex) levels following intramuscular injection in relapsing-remitting MS patients.	BACKGROUND: The pharmacokinetics of IFNbeta-1a in MS patients are poorly understood. We have previously reported an ELISA sensitive and specific for measuring serum IFNbeta-1b levels in patients with MS. OBJECTIVE: We describe an ELISA to measure interferon beta-1a (Avonex) in the serum of MS patients following IM administration. METHODS: We have developed an ELISA for detecting serum IFNbeta-1a in MS patients receiving 6 million units (MU) of IFNbeta-1a, IM once weekly. The specificity of this ELISA was confirmed by the lack of cross-reactivity with other cytokines except for IFNbeta-1b. RESULTS: Serum IFNbeta-1a levels were measured at 3 and 6 months after initiating treatment with IFNbeta-1a in 10 MS patients. At 3 months, all 10 patients had detectable levels ranging from 68 to 86 IU/mL. At 6 months, IFNbeta-1a could be detected in the serum of all but three patients, with levels ranging from 64 to 81 IU/mL. A kinetic study of IFNbeta-1a serum levels in a separate group of six MS patients who had been receiving IFNbeta-1a for several months was carried out. Blood was drawn before and 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after IFNbeta-1a injection. Peak serum IFNbeta-1a levels were observed at 8 hours and became undetectable at 24 hours after injection. CONCLUSION: The described ELISA may have useful clinical applications in examining the correlation between serum IFNbeta-1a levels and clinical efficacy.
11342774	Human herpesvirus-8 genes are expressed in pulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (inflammatory pseudotumor).	The presence of human herpesvirus-8 DNA sequences, as well as an overexpression of human interleukin-6 and human cyclin D1 in myofibroblastic cells of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (inflammatory pseudotumor), has recently been reported. We describe the pattern of human herpesvirus-8 gene expression in five cases of pulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), with several positive and negative controls, was performed to detect mRNA of 11 open reading frames encoded by human herpesvirus-8 in lytic and latent stages of viral replicative cycle. We found molecular transcripts from ORF16, ORFK13, and ORF72 in the five cases and from ORFK2 in four of five neoplasms. The corresponding encoded proteins were human homologous oncoproteins (viral cyclin-D), inflammatory cytokines (viral IL-6), and inhibitors of apoptotic pathways (viral FLIP and viral Bcl-2), mostly expressed in a latent viral replicative stage. The rest of open reading frames examined included mainly lytic-associated genes and showed no expression. The spectrum of expressed viral genes is not the same as can be observed in Kaposi's sarcoma or multicentric Castleman's disease, suggesting that human herpesvirus-8 plays a different role in the pathogenesis of its associated diseases. These differences may be related to either cell-specific or immunologic host factors.
11892816	Differential regulation of HLA-DR mRNAs and cell surface antigens by interferon.	Human interferons-alpha, -beta and -gamma enhance HLA-DR mRNAs in all the human lymphoblastoid and melanoma cell lines studied. The increase concerns both alpha and beta chain mRNAs. Moreover, we show that immune interferon-gamma preferentially enhances class II MHC mRNA. This effect of IFN-gamma on the synthesis of alpha and beta HLA-DR chains has been also analysed by immunoprecipitation. It is abolished by a monoclonal antibody directed against human IFN-gamma. The effect of interferon on the cell surface level of HLA-DR molecules does not always correspond to the enhancement of HLA-DR mRNA. Our experiments suggest that this discrepancy between the enhancement of HLA-DR mRNA and cell surface antigen might be due to a constitutively high level of the corresponding antigens on several of the human cells studied.
11987821	Innate immune responses to LCMV infections: natural killer cells and cytokines.	Although much remains to be learned, the study of early responses to LCMV infections of mice has contributed to the basic understanding of the regulation of a variety of important innate immune responses. Major discoveries have included the appreciation of the levels of type 1 IFNs induced during endogenous responses to viral infections, the importance of IFN-alpha/beta for induction of NK cell cytotoxicity, and the roles for IFN-alpha/beta in regulating the expression of other innate cytokines, i.e., IL-12 and IFN-gamma produced by NK cells (Fig. 11). Taken together with the characterization of adaptive responses to LCMV, a paradigm is emerging for a possible initial to innate to adaptive response cascade during infections with viruses eliciting endogenous expression of high levels of IFN-alpha/beta. The results not only advance the understanding of endogenous responses to viral infections and how they are balanced to achieve the best possible outcome for the host, but also give insights into possible consequences of therapeutic intervention with type 1 IFNs.
8985359	The vesicular stomatitis virus matrix protein inhibits transcription from the human beta interferon promoter.	In cells infected by wild-type (wt) vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) Indiana, host transcription is severely inhibited. DNA cotransfection studies have implicated the VSV matrix (M) protein in this process (B. L. Black and D. S. Lyles, J. Virol. 66:4058-4064, 1992). The M protein inhibited transcription not only from viral promoters in plasmids but also from the chromosomally integrated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) provirus promoter (S.-Y. Paik, A. C. Banerjea, G. G. Harmison, C.-J. Chen, and M. Schubert, J. Virol. 69:3529-3537, 1995). In this study, we investigated the effect of wt VSV M protein on expression of a reporter gene under control of a cellular promoter (beta-interferon [IFN-beta] promoter), using double transient transfections in BHK and COS-1 cells. The cellular IFN-beta promoter was as susceptible to the inhibitory effect of the M protein as the viral promoters used previously. Viral proteins N, P, and G had no significant effect on reporter gene expression. The M protein gene from VSV mutant T1026R1, which is defective in host transcription inhibition, was cloned and sequenced, and its effect on reporter gene expression was tested. The mutant M protein had a methionine-to-arginine change at position 51 in the protein sequence and did not inhibit transcription from either the IFN-beta promoter or viral promoters. This VSV mutant is a good inducer of IFN, as opposed to the wt virus, which suppresses IFN induction. These results show that the M protein inhibits transcription from cellular as well as viral promoters and that the M protein does not regulate the IFN promoter any differently from viral promoters. While the M protein may play a role in IFN gene regulation, other viral or cellular factors that provide specificity to the induction process must also be involved.
9799713	Role of early cytokines, including alpha and beta interferons (IFN-alpha/beta), in innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infections.	Innate cytokine responses are important mediators of early defense against infections. Certain of their effects can be delivered directly to activate protective mechanisms in infected cells. Others activate innate immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages, to mediate defense. Still others shape adaptive immune responses. The compositions and magnitudes of innate cytokine responses are modulated, by the nature of the infectious agent, to facilitate accessing of the anti-microbial defense functions most beneficial in defense against the particular infection. In the context of viral infections, interferons alpha and beta (IFN-alpha/beta) are induced to high levels, and help to mediate and regulate immune responses most effective against this class of agents. The cytokines induce anti-viral mechanisms in infected cells, negatively regulate interleukin 12 expression, and activate NK cell-mediated lysis. Protective development of adaptive immunity to viral infections includes prominent CD8 T cell expansion and activation, and IFN-alpha/beta can mediate functions with the potential to promote these T cell responses. Together, the characteristics define regulation of unique or unique prominent defense mechanisms in place to fight off viral infections.
8267620	Defective receptors for platelet-derived growth factor AA in human fibroblasts with mutant insulin receptors.	Leprechaunism is an inherited disorder characterized by growth restriction and severe insulin resistance and caused by mutations in the insulin receptor gene. Cells from these patients have defective insulin binding. Fibroblasts from some patients have concomitant defects in other tyrosine kinase receptors, such as those for Insulin-like Growth Factor I (IGF-I) and Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF). In this report, binding of insulin, IGF-I, EGF, and Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) AA and PDGF-BB is compared among fibroblasts of patients with defined mutations in their insulin receptor gene. Fibroblasts from patient Atl-1, homozygous for a R86P substitution in the insulin receptor, had reduced binding of Platelet-Derived Growth Factor AA (PDGF-AA), a specific ligand for type alpha PDGF receptors. The reduction in PDGF binding impaired the ability of this growth factor to stimulate DNA synthesis.
8290602	Insulin receptor substrate 1 is required for insulin-mediated mitogenic signal transduction.	Insulin treatment of mammalian cells immediately stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of a cellular protein of 185 kDa referred to as pp185 or IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate 1). The potential role of the IRS-1 protein in insulin signaling has been examined by microinjecting affinity-purified antibodies into living cells. Stably transfected Rat-1 fibroblasts, which overexpress the human insulin receptor, were microinjected and subsequently stimulated with insulin or other growth factors. Progression through the cell cycle was monitored by using a single-cell assay, which employs bromodeoxyuridine labeling of DNA and analysis with immunofluorescence microscopy. Microinjection of anti-IRS-1 antibody completely inhibited incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine into the nuclei of cells stimulated with insulin or insulin-like growth factor I but did not affect cells stimulated with serum or a variety of purified growth factors. These studies indicate that IRS-1 is a critical component of the insulin and insulin-like growth factor I signaling pathways, which lead to DNA synthesis and cell growth.
8707846	Ubiquitination of the yeast a-factor receptor.	The a-factor receptor (Ste3p) is one of two pheromone receptors in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that enable the cell-cell communication of mating. In this report, we show that this receptor is subject to two distinct covalent modifications-phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Phosphorylation, evident on the unstimulated receptor, increases upon challenge by the receptor's ligand, a-factor. We suggest that this phosphorylation likely functions in the adaptive, negative regulation of receptor activity. Removal of phosphorylation by phosphatase treatment uncovered two phosphatase-resistant modifications identified as ubiquitination using a myc-epitope-tagged ubiquitin construct. Ste3p undergoes rapid, ligand-independent turnover that depends on vacuolar proteases and also on transport of the receptor from surface to vacuole (i.e., endocytosis) (Davis, N.G., J.L.Horecka, and G.F. Sprague, Jr., 1993 J. Cell Biol. 122:53-65). An end4 mutation, isolated for its defect in the endocytic uptake of alpha-factor pheromone (Raths, S., J. Rohrer, F. Crausaz, and H. Riezman. 1993. J. Cell Biol. 120:55-65), blocks constitutive endocytosis of the a-factor receptor, yet fails to block ubiquitination of the receptor. In fact, both phosphorylation and ubiquitination of the surfacebound receptor were found to increase, suggesting that these modifications may occur normally while the receptor is at the cell surface. In a mutant strain constructed to allow for depletion of ubiquitin, the level of receptor ubiquitination was found to be substantially decreased. Correlated with this was an impairment of receptor degradative turnover-receptor half-life that is normally approximately 20 min at 30 degrees C was increased to approximately 2 h under these ubiquitin-depletion conditions. Furthermore, surface residency, normally of short duration in wild-type cells (terminated by endocytosis to the vacuole), was found to be prolonged; the majority of the receptor protein remained surface localized fully 2 h after biosynthesis. Thus, the rates of a-factor receptor endocytosis and consequent vacuolar turnover depend on the available level of ubiquitin in the cell. In cells mutant for two E2 activities, i.e., ubc4 delta ubc5 delta cells, the receptor was found to be substantially less ubiquitinated, and in addition, receptor turnover was slowed, suggesting that Ubc4p and Ubc5p may play a role in the recognition of the receptor protein as substrate for the ubiquitin system. In addition to ligand-independent uptake, the a-factor receptor also undergoes a ligand-dependent form of endocytosis (Davis, N.G., J.L. Horecka, and G.F. Sprague, Jr. 1993. J. Cell. Biol. 122:53-65). Concurrent with ligand-dependent uptake, we now show that the receptor undergoes ligand-induced ubiquitination, suggesting that receptor ubiquitination may function in the ligand-dependent endocytosis of the a-factor receptor as well as in its constitutive endocytosis. To account for these findings, we propose a model wherein the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to surface receptor triggers endocytic uptake.
9108054	Insulin-like growth factor II stimulates cell proliferation through the insulin receptor.	R- cells are 3T3-like fibroblasts generated from mouse embryos nullizygous for a targeted disruption of the genes encoding the type 1 insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor (IGF1R). These cells fail to proliferate in serum-free medium supplemented with purified growth factors, in contrast to their wild-type counterparts. However, when R- cells overexpress the insulin receptor from a stably integrated plasmid, R-/IR cells, they become capable of growing in serum-free medium supplemented solely with insulin or IGF-II, but not with IGF-I. Moreover, the introduction into R-/IR cells of an additional plasmid expressing IGF-II causes these cells to proliferate in serum-free medium without growth factor supplementation. From these results, we conclude that IGF-II can stimulate cell proliferation not only through its cognate IGF1R but also through the insulin receptor.
9112018	A homozygous kinase-defective mutation in the insulin receptor gene in a patient with leprechaunism.	We report a homozygous missense mutation at position 1092 (substitution of glutamine for arginine) in the tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor in a patient with leprechaunism associated with severe insulin resistance and intrauterine growth retardation. Site-directed mutagenesis as well as analyses of the patient's lymphocytes revealed that this mutation causes a marked decrease in tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor without any defect in insulin binding, which causes severe defects in insulin-stimulated glucose transport, glycogen synthesis and DNA synthesis. Thus, this is the first homozygous mutation resulting in a selective-kinase defect of the insulin receptor. Interestingly, the parents who are cousins and are heterozygous for the mutation have type A insulin resistance syndrome. This correlation between genotype and phenotype in a single pedigree suggests that the severity of the mutation will determine the phenotype. Based upon this assumption, we have been successful in prenatal diagnosis of the fifth child. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of clinical administration of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in this patient and in vitro analysis of the patient's skin fibroblasts, suggesting that IGF-I can compensate for insulin action via the IGF-I receptor in a patient almost lacking functional insulin receptors.
9690478	Crystal structure of the first three domains of the type-1 insulin-like growth factor receptor.	The type-1 insulin-like growth-factor receptor (IGF-1R) and insulin receptor (IR) are closely related members of the tyrosine-kinase receptor superfamily. IR is essential for glucose homeostasis, whereas IGF-1R is involved in both normal growth and development and malignant transformation. Homologues of these receptors are found in animals as simple as cnidarians. The epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR) family is closely related to the IR family and has significant sequence identity to the extracellular portion we describe here. We now present the structure of the first three domains of IGF-IR (L1-Cys-rich-L2) determined to 2.6 A resolution. The L domains each consist of a single-stranded right-handed beta-helix. The Cys-rich region is composed of eight disulphide-bonded modules, seven of which form a rod-shaped domain with modules associated in an unusual manner. The three domains surround a central space of sufficient size to accommodate a ligand molecule. Although the fragment (residues 1-462) does not bind ligand, many of the determinants responsible for hormone binding and ligand specificity map to this central site. This structure therefore shows how the IR subfamily might interact with their ligands.
10365914	Enhancement of susceptibility to diverse skin tumor promoters by activation of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor in the epidermis of transgenic mice.	Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its receptor are believed to play an important role in mitogenesis and neoplastic transformation. The purpose of this study was to further examine the role of IGF-1 during tumor promotion in mouse skin. HK1.IGF1 transgenic mice, which overexpress IGF-1 in epidermis via the human keratin 1 promoter, were previously shown to be hypersensitive to skin tumor promotion by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). We examined these mice for their sensitivity to diverse classes of tumor-promoting agents. HK1.IGF-1 transgenic mice initiated with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene were more sensitive to treatment with a wide variety of tumor promoters, including chrysarobin, okadaic acid, and benzoyl peroxide, which resulted in more rapid development of tumors and a dramatic increase in the number of tumors per mouse compared with corresponding non-transgenic mice treated with the same compounds. Histological analyses of skin from HK1.IGF-1 mice treated with various tumor promoters revealed that these mice were also more sensitive to the induction of epidermal hyperplasia and cell proliferation. Analysis of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1r) and epidermal growth factor (EGFr) in the epidermis of TPA-treated HK1.IGF-1 transgenic and non-transgenic mice revealed that both receptors were activated (hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues), and the level of activation was higher in transgenic mice. The mechanism for the increased sensitivity of HK1.IGF-1 mice to tumor promoters may involve cooperation between the IGF-1r and EGFr signaling pathways. Our data suggest that IGF-1r signaling may play an important role in the process of tumor promotion by diverse classes of tumor promoters.
10926366	Structural and functional characterization of insulin receptor substrate proteins and the molecular mechanisms of their interaction with insulin superfamily tyrosine kinase receptors and effector proteins.	The literature data on the role of IRS1/IRS2 proteins, endogenous substrates for insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, in transduction of signals generated by insulin superfamily peptides (insulin, insulin-like growth factor) were analyzed. The molecular mechanisms of the functional coupling of IRS proteins with peptide receptors possessing a tyrosine kinase activity and SH2 domain-containing proteins (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Grb2 adaptor protein, protein phosphotyrosine phosphatase) were discussed. The structural and functional properties of IRS proteins (distribution of functional domains and sites for tyrosine phosphorylation; conservatism of amino acid sequences) were characterized. The data on the alternative pathways of transduction of signals which are generated by insulin and related peptides and do not involve IRS proteins were analyzed. These pathways are realized through Shc proteins or via direct interaction between receptors and SH2 proteins. Amino acid sequences of IRS proteins and insulin superfamily tyrosine kinase receptors were compared. The homologous regions in IRS proteins and receptors, which can be responsible for their coupling with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein phosphotyrosine phosphatases, were identified.
11121124	Characterization of glucose transport system in keratinocytes: insulin and IGF-1 differentially affect specific transporters.	Skin is one of the major tissues displaying chronic diabetic complications. We have studied glucose transport following stimulation with insulin and IGF-1 in cultured mouse keratinocytes. In proliferating cells, acute stimulation with insulin and IGF-1 increased glucose uptake. Insulin translocated glucose transporters 1 and 5, whereas IGF-1 translocated glucose transporters 2 and 3. With differentiation, glucose transporter 3 expression increased and the expression of glucose transporters 1, 2, and 5 decreased. No increase in glucose uptake was observed, however, following stimulation with either hormone. These results indicate that insulin and IGF-1 differentially regulate glucose uptake as well as expression and translocation of specific transporters in skin keratinocytes.
11479214	Re-expression of estrogen receptor alpha in estrogen receptor alpha-negative MCF-7 cells restores both estrogen and insulin-like growth factor-mediated signaling and growth.	Estrogen can increase insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) expression, two key components of IGF-I-mediated signaling. The result is sensitization of breast cancer cells to IGF-I and synergistic growth in the presence of estrogen and IGF-I. We hypothesized that loss of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) would result in reduced IGF-mediated signaling and growth. To test this hypothesis, we examined IGF-I effects in MCF-7 breast cancer cell sublines that have been selected for loss of ERalpha (C4 and C4-12 cells are ERalpha-negative) by long-term estrogen withdrawal. C4 and C4-12 cells had reduced IGF-IR and IRS-1 mRNA and protein expression (compared with MCF-7 cells) that was not inducible by estrogen. Furthermore, C4 and C4-12 cells showed reduced IGF-I signaling and failed to show any growth response to either estrogen or IGF-I. To prove that loss of IGF and estrogen-mediated signaling and growth was a consequence of loss of ERalpha, we re-expressed ERalpha in C4-12 cells by stable transfection with HA-tagged ERalpha. Three independent C4-12 ERalpha-HA clones expressed a functional ERalpha that (a) was down-regulated by estrogen, (b) conferred estrogen-induction of cyclin D1 expression, and (c) caused estrogen-mediated increase in the number of cells in S phase. All of the effects were completely blocked by antiestrogens. Interestingly, ERalpha-HA expression in C4-12 cells did not restore estrogen induction of progesterone receptor expression. However, ERalpha-positive C4-12 cells now exhibited estrogen-induction of IGF-IR and IRS-1 levels and responded mitogenically to both estrogen and IGF-I. These data show that ERalpha is a critical requirement for IGF signaling, and to our knowledge this is the first report of functional ERalpha expression that confers estrogen-mediated growth of an ER-negative breast cancer cell line.
11888245	Characterization of the receptor for insulin-like growth factor on Leishmania promastigotes.	Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I constitutively present in the skin is one of the first growth factors that Leishmania parasites encounter after transmission to the vertebrate host. We have previously shown that IGF-I is a potent growth-promoting factor for Leishmania parasites. IGF-I binds specifically to a single-site putative receptor at the parasite membrane, triggering a cascade of phosphorylation reactions. In the present article we characterize the receptor for IGF-I on Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana promastigotes. The receptor is a monomeric glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 65 kDa and is antigenically related to the alpha chain of human type 1 IGF-I receptor. Upon IGF-I stimulation the receptor undergoes autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues with activation of its signaling pathway. Activation of the IGF-I receptor also leads to phosphorylation of an 185-kDa molecule that is homologous to the substrate of the insulin receptor present in human cells, the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1).
11903488	Renal proximal tubular cell growth and differentiation are differentially modulated by renotropic growth factors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors.	BACKGROUND: The renotropic growth factors (GFs), hepatocyte GF (HGF), epidermal GF (EGF), and insulin-like GF-I (IGF-I) accelerate renal regeneration in animal models after toxic or ischemic injury. These GFs initiate their biological effects on renal tubular cells by interaction with specific transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the proximal tubular cell line PT-1, the biological effects of HGF, EGF, and IGF-I and the growth-inhibitory effects of different tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were investigated. Receptor binding and tyrosine kinase phosphorylation were determined by ligand binding studies and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: HGF, EGF, and IGF-I bound with nanomolar affinity to their specific cell membrane receptor tyrosine kinases. In contrast to EGF or IGF-I, HGF induced a variety of cell morphological changes, including cell scattering, formation of tubular structures, and expression of long microvilli on the apical cell membrane. HGF was a 10-fold more potent and more effective growth promoter than EGF or IGF-I. Among the TKIs tested, the mitogenic effect of HGF could be more specifically inhibited by emodin and tyrphostin, that of EGF by methyl-2,5-dihydroxycinnamate, lavendustin A, and genistein, and that of IGF-I by geldanamycin. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to EGF and IGF-I, HGF stimulated both growth and differentiation of renal proximal tubular cells, demonstrating the amazing biological potency of this renotropic growth factor. Selective TKIs may be a promising approach to modulate diseases with abnormalities in protein kinase signalling pathways such as renal cell carcinoma.
12783946	Control strategies correcting inaccurately programmed fingertip forces: model predictions derived from human behavior.	When picking up a familiar object between the index finger and the thumb, the motor commands are predetermined by the CNS to correspond to the frictional demand of the finger-object contact area. If the friction is less than expected, the object will start to slip out of the hand, giving rise to unexpected sensory information. Here we study the correction strategies of the motor system in response to an unexpected frictional demand. The motor commands to the mononeuron pool are estimated by a novel technique combining behavioral recordings and neuromuscular modelling. We first propose a mathematical model incorporating muscles, hand mechanics, and the action of lifting an object. A simple control system sends motor commands to and receives sensory signals from the model. We identify three factors influencing the efficiency of the correction: the time development of the motor command, the delay between the onset of the grip and load forces (GF-LF-delay), and how fast the lift is performed. A sensitivity analysis describes how these factors affect the ability to prevent or stop slipping and suggests an efficient control strategy that prepares and corrects for an altered frictional condition. We then analyzed fingertip grip and load forces (GF and LF) and position data from 200 lifts made by five healthy subjects. The friction was occasionally reduced, forcing an increase of the GF to prevent the object being dropped. The data were then analyzed by feeding it through the inverted model. This provided an estimate of the motor commands to the motoneuron pool. As suggested by the sensitivity analysis the GF-LF-delay was indeed used by the subjects to prevent slip. In agreement with recordings from neurons in the primary motor cortex of the monkey, a sharp burst in the estimated GF motor command (NGF) efficiently arrested any slip. The estimated motor commands indicate a control system that uses a small set of corrective commands, which together with the GF-LF-delay form efficient correction strategies. The selection of a strategy depends on the amount of tactile information reporting unexpected friction and how long it takes to arrive. We believe that this technique of estimating the motor commands behind the fingertip forces during a precision grip lift can provide a powerful tool for the investigation of the central control of the motor system.
8038512	The influence of intestinal flora on wound healing in mice.	The wound healing process was analyzed using male ICR germ-free (Gf) mice and their conventionalized (Cvz) counterparts to determine whether intestinal flora has any influence on the wound healing of a host. A longitudinal skin incision of about 35 mm was made in the dorsum of each mouse, and six interrupted sutures with 5-0 monofilament nylon thread laid for wound closure. Mice from both groups were killed on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th postoperative days, and the tensile strength of the healing wound and hydroxyproline (HP) concentration in the biologically active zone were measured as parameters of wound healing. The daily nitrogen balance and urinary creatinine excretion were also measured for 8 days. The Cvz mice showed greater tensile strength of the wound on the 3rd and 7th postoperative days, and a higher ratio of HP concentration, being wound tissue/control tissue, than their counterparts. The Cvz mice also thrived more prominently than the Gf mice, showing a positive nitrogen balance with limited urinary creatinine excretion. These results suggest the enhancing effect of normal intestinal flora on wound healing, probably through the beneficial nutritional effects supplied by the bacteria.
8070613	Physiological concentrations of insulin induce cellular desensitization to the mitogenic effects of insulin-like growth factor I.	Insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) are structurally related peptides capable of stimulating a variety of metabolic and mitogenic processes. In this study, we investigated the interaction between these peptides and their receptor-mediated pathways in an untransformed cell line. Cultured bovine fibroblasts specifically bound IGF-I and insulin, and each peptide could stimulate DNA synthesis and cell replication through its own receptor. Preincubation of bovine fibroblasts with concentrations of insulin that did not bind to the IGF-I receptor resulted in complete but reversible cellular desensitization to IGF-I-stimulated mitogenesis. Preincubation with as little as 0.1 nM insulin was sufficient to inhibit subsequent IGF-I action. Various insulin analogs produced desensitization in direct relation to the affinity of the insulin for the insulin receptor. Desensitization required > 4 h of cell exposure to insulin and was blocked in the presence of cycloheximide. Neither serum-stimulated mitogenesis nor IGF-I-stimulated glucose uptake were affected by insulin pretreatment. 125I-labeled IGF-I affinity cross-linking experiments indicated that preincubation with insulin did not affect labeling of the 130,000-M(r) alpha-subunit of the IGF-I receptor, but was associated with the loss of IGF-I- and insulin-inhibitive bands at M(r) = 100,000, 85,000, 58,000, and 34,000. These studies suggest that insulin, via interaction with insulin receptors on bovine fibroblasts, regulates IGF-I action at a step distal to IGF-I receptor binding and are consistent with desensitization occurring at an intracellular step in the mitogenic pathway shared by insulin and IGF-I.
8166607	Toxicity of the combined nerve agents GB/GF in mice: efficacy of atropine and various oximes as antidotes.	The toxicity of a combination of isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate (sarin; GB) and cyclohexyl methylphosphonofluoridate (GF) and the efficacy of various oxime reactivators in combination with atropine against the combined GB/GF challenge were evaluated in mice. The 24-h s.c. LD50 of the GB/GF combination was 1.15 mumol/kg (1.10-1.21; 95% confidence limits). Mice administered GB/GF displayed typical signs of nerve agent poisoning such as tremors and convulsions, with death most likely due to anoxia subsequent to respiratory arrest. The GB/GF LD50 value was comparable to the s.c. LD50 of 1.35 and 1.21 mumol/kg for GF and GB in mice, respectively. Combining the two nerve agents did not result in potentiation of the toxicity. In combination with atropine sulfate (17.4 mg/kg, i.p.), which alone did not reduce mortality, the oximes tested, 2-PAM, obidoxime and HI-6, were all effective when administered 5 min before 3 x LD50 dose of GB/GF with 24-h ED50 values of 102.5, 18.22 and 1.96 mumol/kg, respectively. Use of the GB/GF combination does not appear to confer any unique toxicity profile and appears to be easily treated with the standard therapy of a cholinolytic and oxime.
8194471	Comparison of the intracellular itineraries of insulin-like growth factor-I and insulin and their receptors in Rat-1 fibroblasts.	In this study we have compared the intracellular itineraries of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and their receptors subsequent to ligand internalization in rat fibroblasts. We found that the endocytic rate constant is approximately 3 times as high for insulin as for IGF-I. The dissociation of internalized ligand from its receptor was monitored by the ability of ligand-receptor complexes to precipitate in the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG). Insulin loses its ability to precipitate with PEG more rapidly than IGF-I. After 60 min, less than 10% of the intracellular insulin remains PEG precipitable, whereas 44% of intracellular IGF-I stays PEG precipitable. Ligand degradation was determined by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Insulin degradation after internalization is more rapid compared with IGF-I degradation; after 2 h, 80% of intracellular IGF-I, in contrast to only 30% of intracellular insulin, remains intact. We measured retroendocytosis of insulin and IGF-I by assessing the amount of internalized ligand that was subsequently released from the cells. When analyzing released ligand by TCA precipitation, we found that 25% of insulin and 53% of IGF-I were TCA precipitable. After 120 min, only 16% of insulin and 43% of IGF-I remained intracellular. To provide insight into a possible mechanism that prevents IGF-I from being subjected to the same degree of degradation as insulin, we studied the effect of pH on IGF-I and insulin binding. We found IGF-I binding to be less sensitive to decreases in pH compared with insulin binding. Therefore, it is likely that after internalization, IGF-I does not dissociate from its intracellular receptor as easily as insulin in the acidifying endosome and, therefore, can return to the cell surface via a recycling receptor. In summary, we have observed distinct differences in the intracellular itineraries of IGF-I and insulin and their receptors. IGF-I internalization and degradation proceed less efficiently than insulin internalization, and IGF-I is preferentially targeted into a retroendocytotic pathway in contrast to insulin, which primarily undergoes lysosomal degradation. The differential effect of pH on ligand binding to these structurally related hormone receptors may account for the quantitatively distinct ligand trafficking events.
8537376	Intermolecular phosphorylation between insulin holoreceptors does not stimulate substrate kinase activity.	We photocoupled benzoylphenylalanineB25, B29 epsilon-biotin insulin (BBpa-insulin) to native insulin receptors to obtain a uniform receptor population with covalently bound, non-dissociable ligand. We employed BBpa-insulin-bound and autophosphorylated (activated) receptor to phosphorylate substrate insulin receptor under conditions where the substrate receptor never interacts with insulin. The substrate receptor becomes phosphorylated in this inter-receptor fashion and reaches a phosphorylation state 50% of the maximal obtainable by autophosphorylation. However, this phosphorylation does not activate the substrate receptor to any measurable degree. We conclude that intermolecular phosphorylation of the insulin holoreceptors is unlikely to be of physiological significance.
9003010	Roles of insulin receptor substrate-1 and Shc on insulin-like growth factor I receptor signaling in early passages of cultured human fibroblasts.	Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) improves glucose metabolism and growth in patients with leprechaunism. We investigated signal transduction through IGF-I receptor in comparison with epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor in early passages of cultured skin fibroblasts from a normal subject and a patient with leprechaunism whose insulin receptor tyrosine kinase was almost nonexistent. Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) became tyrosine-phosphorylated and bound growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) quickly by IGF-I. The association of Shc with GRB2 by IGF-I was detected by immunoblot with anti-Shc antibody but was hardly visible with antiphosphotyrosine antibody, which was in marked contrast to efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc by EGF. However, the potency of IGF-I for DNA synthesis was far stronger than EGF, which was not parallel with the potency of these growth factors to activate Shc or MAP kinase. Rather, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity, which was activated by IGF-I about 5- to 10-fold more strongly than EGF, appeared to correlate with mitogenesis. Signal transduction pathways following IGF-I receptor or EGF receptor activation were indistinguishable between the normal subject and the patient. Our results strongly suggest that in human skin fibroblasts, which represent a more physiological cell culture: 1) IRS-1, rather than Shc, is the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein binding GRB2 in initial phase of IGF-I signaling; 2) mitogenic potency of receptor tyrosine kinases such as IGF-I receptor and EGF receptor may not be determined solely by the amount of Shc-GRB2 complex or the activity of MAP kinase; and 3) in contrast to previous reports, IGF-I and EGF receptor signalings are not defective in leprechaunism.
9589675	Defects of insulin action and skeletal muscle glucose metabolism in growth hormone-deficient adults persist after 24 months of recombinant human growth hormone therapy.	We have previously reported that GH-deficient (GHD) adults are severely insulin resistant. In the present study, we determined the effects of 6 months (n = 7) and 24 months (long-term; n = 11) of recombinant human GH (rhGH) therapy (approximately 0.22 IU/kg.week) on body composition and fasting biochemical (including lipid) parameters, and baseline and insulin-stimulated: 1) rates of hepatic glucose production, total glucose disposal (Rd), total glycolysis (GF) and glucose storage (GS); and 2) skeletal muscle glucose processing [using the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic (approximately 60 mU/L) clamp technique with tritiated glucose infusion coupled with skeletal muscle biopsies]. To allow baseline comparison, these measurements were also obtained from 10 control subjects matched to the pretreated GHD adults for age, sex, and body mass index. Long-term rhGH therapy in GHD adults induced significant improvements in fat mass, abdominal fat mass and fat free mass, and reductions in fasting cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels (P < 0.05-0.01 vs. pretreatment values). However, there was a significant increase in fasting insulin (13.1 +/- 0.9 vs. 8.6 +/- 1.1 mU/L; P < 0.01) and connecting peptide (0.56 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.41 +/- 0.06 nmol/L; P < 0.05). Although rates of baseline hepatic glucose production, GF, and GS were unchanged, the insulin-stimulated increment (delta) in Rd, GF, and GS remained markedly attenuated in the long-term rhGH-treated GHD adults [pretreatment: delta Rd 16.6 +/- 3.4, delta GF 3.0 +/- 1.2, delta GS 13.6 +/- 3.0 vs. 24 months of rhGH: delta Rd 17.2 +/- 3.3, delta GF 3.1 +/- 0.9, delta GS 14.1 +/- 2.5 vs. controls: delta Rd 42.6 +/- 4.3, delta GF 9.2 +/- 1.9, delta GS 35.9 +/- 4.5 mumol/kg fat free mass.min; P < 0.05-0.01 vs. controls]. Additionally, there was a sustained reduction in the insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle glycogen synthase fractional velocity (pretreatment: 0.29 +/- 0.03 vs. 24 months of rhGH: 0.24 +/- 0.03 vs. controls: 0.48 +/- 0.04; both P < 0.05 vs. controls), which was accompanied by a sustained 44% decrease in baseline glycogen content and a 70% increase in baseline im glucose concentrations in the presence of low-to-normal glucose 6-phosphate levels and persisting euglycemia. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that body weight and fasting free fatty acid and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol accounted for 82% of the variance in the insulin sensitivity index in long-term rhGH-treated adults, and that the 24-month fasting insulin-like growth factor 1 was a negative predictor of the change in insulin sensitivity (r = -0.82; P < 0.01). In conclusion, despite improvements in body composition and lipid profiles, the severe defects of in vivo insulin sensitivity and skeletal muscle intracellular glucose phosphorylation and glycogen synthase activity, which are associated with modestly elevated insulin-like growth factor 1 levels, normal free fatty acid levels, and the development of hyperinsulinemia, persist with long-term rhGH therapy.
9886492	Formation of distinct signalling complexes involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity with stimulation of epidermal growth factor or insulin-like growth factor-I in human skin fibroblasts.	We recently described a better correlation of DNA synthesis with phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase than with mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase stimulated by insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 or epidermal growth factor (EGF) in human skin fibroblasts (Takahashi et al., 1997, Endocrinology 138:741-750). IGF-I-induced PI 3-kinase activation is generally mediated via insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, but EGF-induced PI 3-kinase activation is mediated by various signalling molecules such as ErbB3 and c-Cbl in different cells. We therefore investigated the mechanism regulating PI 3-kinase in human skin fibroblasts by comparing complexes involving PI 3-kinase when stimulated by IGF-I or EGF and found that p115 and p105, which were tyrosine-phosphorylated by EGF stimulation and associated with SHP-2, were also associated with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase by EGF. Anti-SHP-2 and anti-p85 subunits of PI 3-kinase antibodies did not coprecipitate tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptor or ErbB3; in addition, p115 and p105 appeared to be distinct from tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Cbl. Thus, tyrosine-phosphorylated p115 and p105 may provide a novel platform recruiting p85, which may simultaneously bind to SHP-2. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of p115 or p 105 was undetectable by immunoblot with IGF-I stimulation, and PI 3-kinase activity was mediated via IRS-1 phosphorylated with IGF-I stimulation, little of which was associated with SHP-2. Thus, EGF and IGF-I cause formation of a distinct signalling complex which associates with p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase.
11475768	In vitro viability, mitogenicity and clonogenic capacities of periodontal ligament fibroblasts after storage in four media supplemented with growth factors.	The choice of storage medium for preserving traumatically avulsed teeth is important for the success of future replantation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of growth factors (IGF-1 and PDGF-BB) when added to storage media in preserving the functional abilities of cultured periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLF). The evaluated storage media were: ViaSpan, Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), alpha minimal essential medium (alpha MEM), and alpha MEM supplemented with FCS and antibiotic (alpha MEM-S). PDLF were obtained from explants of human healthy extracted teeth. Plates with confluent PDLF were soaked in the various media supplemented with IGF-1 (10 ng/ml) and PDGF-BB (4 ng/ml) for 2, 8 and 24 h at room temperature (24 degrees C). The control group was incubated with the examined storage media without growth factors at 24 degrees C. An additional control group was incubated with culture medium at 37 degrees C without growth factors. After incubation, the viability of the cells was determined by Trypan blue exclusion test. Viable cells were then analyzed for mitogenic (with thymidine) and clonogenic (by culturing one cell/well) capacities. Storage of PDLF with growth factors (GF) for 2, 8 and 24 h decreased their vitality by only 3% (not statistically significant). The mitogenicity of PDLF stored for 2, 8 and 24 h in various media with GF was statistically comparable to that of the control group. Generally, the highest mitogenic capacity of PDLF stored with or without GF was found after 8 h of storage. Increasing the storage period to 24 h decreased the mitogenic capacity of the cells stored with GF by only 10-40% compared to the control group. In contrast, the clonogenic capacity of PDLF stored with GF increased with increasing storage periods by 100-300%, and the highest clonogenic capacity was found in most storage media after 24 h of storage with GF. The highest clonogenic and mitogenic capacities were found in cells stored in HBSS followed by alpha MEM-S. The mitogenic and clonogenic capacities of PDLF stored in various media supplemented with GF for 2-8 h were generally lower than without GF supplementation. The mitogenic and clonogenic effects of GF-supplementation was observed only after 24 h of storage. After 24 h of storage with GF, the clonogenic capacity increased by 8-224% and the mitogenicity by 20-37%, except in cells stored in alpha MEM (-1%). However, these differences were generally not statistically significant. In conclusion, the mitogenic and clonogenic effects of GF were observed only after 24 h of storage at room temperature. HBSS and alpha MEM-S supplemented with GF were the most effective media for preserving the viability, mitogenicity and clonogenic capacity of PDLF stored for 24 h at room temperature. For short periods of storage (2 and 8 h), HBSS and alpha MEM-S without GF were preferable.
12690206	DAF-16 target genes that control C. elegans life-span and metabolism.	Signaling from the DAF-2/insulin receptor to the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor controls longevity, metabolism, and development in disparate phyla. To identify genes that mediate the conserved biological outputs of daf-2/insulin-like signaling, we used comparative genomics to identify 17 orthologous genes from Caenorhabditis and Drosophila, each of which bears a DAF-16 binding site in the promoter region. One-third of these DAF-16 downstream candidate genes were regulated by daf-2/insulin-like signaling in C. elegans, and RNA interference inactivation of the candidates showed that many of these genes mediate distinct aspects of daf-16 function, including longevity, metabolism, and development.
12776186	Retinoic acid-induced growth arrest of MCF-7 cells involves the selective regulation of the IRS-1/PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway.	In the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are known to elicit antiproliferative actions via the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)/PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway. All-trans retinoic acid (RA) is a potent inhibitor of MCF-7 cell proliferation, but the mechanism by which growth regulation is achieved remains unclear. We investigated the effects of RA on the regulation of the IGF-IR and its key signaling elements: IRS-1, IRS-2, and SHC. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with RA caused a significant reduction in IRS-1 protein and tyrosine phosphorylation levels at a concentration and time consistent with RA-mediated growth inhibition. IRS-1 regulation is selective, as RA did not influence IRS-2 or SHC levels. Downstream signaling events were also selectively reduced, as RA abrogated IGF-I-stimulated AKT activation but did not alter erk1/2 activation. To confirm the importance of IRS-1 regulation by RA, we examined the response to RA in MCF-7 cells overexpressing IGF-IR and IRS-1. RA resistance was observed in MCF-7 cells overexpressing IRS-1 but not IGF-IR. This suggests that RA-mediated growth inhibition requires the selective downregulation of IRS-1 and AKT. Therapeutic agents targeting the IRS-1/PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway may enhance the cytostatic effects of RA in breast cancer, since overexpression of IRS-1 and AKT have been reported in primary breast tumors.
8033892	Involvement of Src-homology/collagen (SHC) proteins in signaling through the insulin receptor and the insulin-like-growth-factor-I-receptor.	Src homology/collagen (SHC) proteins are thought to participate in signaling through both receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the insulin receptor and the EGF (epidermal growth factor) receptor, and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, such as v-src and v-fps. Here we approached the insulin-induced and the insulin-like-growth-factor-I-induced (IGF-I-induced) phosphorylation of SHC proteins, and the possible role of these proteins in insulin and IGF-I signaling. First, we showed that SHC proteins are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon insulin and IGF-I treatment of fibroblasts transfected with a SHC cDNA construct. More important, ligand-activated insulin and IGF-I receptors phosphorylate SHC proteins in vitro, indicating that SHC proteins could be direct substrates for insulin and IGF-I receptors. Further, insulin or IGF-I treatment of SHC-transfected fibroblasts leads to immunoprecipitation of SHC proteins with insulin-receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). We next looked at the possible effect of SHC proteins on biological responses in SHC-transfected fibroblasts. We found that the expression of exogenous SHC proteins results in an increased basal MEK (MAPK/ERK-activating kinase) activity. Further, neither the basal nor the insulin-induced or IGF-I-induced PtdIns-3-kinase activity were modified by expression of exogenous SHC proteins. These results illustrate that SHC proteins are implicated in the MAP (mitogen-activated protein)-kinase pathway, but not in that of PtdIns-3-kinase. Finally, we show that SHC-transfected cells, unlike control cells, are able to advance into the early phases of the cell cycle, and are more sensitive to the growth-promoting effect of insulin. In conclusion, SHC proteins are substrates for insulin and IGF-I receptors, and would appear to function as early post-receptor signaling components.
8881457	Homozygous nonsense mutation in the insulin receptor gene of a patient with severe congenital insulin resistance: leprechaunism and the role of the insulin-like growth factor receptor.	Severe congenital insulin resistance in the syndrome of leprechaunism is caused by mutations in the insulin receptor gene. We report a patient with leprechaunism who was homozygous for a mutation resulting in the absence of cell surface insulin receptors. To determine whether the receptor for Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is involved in the phenotype of leprechaunism, we studied the effect of insulin and of IGF-I on cells from this patient. The patient had a homozygous C-->T substitution at base pair 8212 in exon 12 of the insulin receptor gene, creating a premature stop codon. This nonsense mutation is in the extracellular portion of the receptor and truncates the insulin receptor proximal to its transmembrane anchor, resulting in the absence of cell surface insulin receptors. This finding indicates that complete absence of the insulin receptor is compatible with life. Secondly, DNA synthesis was studied in skin derived fibroblasts in response to increasing concentrations of either insulin or Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and was assessed by 3H-thymidine incorporation. In this patient's cells, both of these hormones increased 3H-thymidine incorporation, and the effect was blocked by alpha-IR3, a monoclonal antibody that blocks activation of the IGF-I receptor. These findings confirmed the absence of the insulin receptor and indicated that insulin acts here through activation of the IGF-I receptor. These data support the contention that the phenotypic and metabolic abnormalities of leprechaunism result from the combination of lack of insulin receptor action and over-activation by insulin of the type 1 IGF receptor.
9457064	Insulin-like growth factor I induction of c-myc expression in bovine fibroblasts can be blocked by antecedent insulin receptor activation.	We previously reported that preexposure of cultured bovine fibroblasts to insulin at low concentrations inhibits subsequent insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)-stimulated DNA synthesis. This insulin-induced desensitization to IGF-I is mediated by specific insulin receptors on bovine fibroblasts and occurs distally to IGF-I receptor engagement and activation. In the present study, we use this model system to determine insulin and IGF-I receptor interplay in the regulation of proto-oncogenes involved in mitogenesis. Insulin (10 nM), IGF-I (10 nM), and 10% fetal bovine serum were each capable of stimulating rapid and transient c-fos and c-myc mRNA expression in bovine fibroblasts. Expression of c-myc was most responsive to mitogenic stimuli; IGF-I and serum had equivalent potency resulting in approximately 14-fold increases in c-myc mRNA expression, while insulin produced 3- to 5-fold increases. Max mRNA, which encodes the partner protein for Myc, was constitutively expressed and levels did not change with treatment or with time. When bovine fibroblasts were pretreated with 10 nM insulin for 48 h, washed, and then stimulated with 10 nM IGF-I, alterations in c-fos mRNA expression were moderate. In contrast, insulin pretreatment completely blocked IGF-I induction of c-myc expression. This block was averted if a specific inhibitor of intracellular signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway was present during the incubation period with insulin. These data indicate significant insulin/IGF-I receptor interplay in normal bovine fibroblasts and suggest that insulin receptor-initiated signaling can profoundly alter proto-oncogene expression induced by growth factors sharing components of a common intracellular signaling network.
10359082	Differential dissociation kinetics explain the binding preference of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-6 for insulin-like growth factor-II over insulin-like growth factor-I.	Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-6 binds insulin-like growth factor-II with a marked preferential affinity over insulin-like growth factor-I. The kinetic basis of this binding preference was studied using surface plasmon resonance. Binding of insulin-like growth factor-I and insulin-like growth factor-II to immobilized insulin-like growth factor binding protein-6 fitted a two-site binding kinetic model. Insulin-like growth factor-I and insulin-like growth factor-II association rates were similar whereas the dissociation rate was approximately 60-fold lower for insulin-like growth factor-II, resulting in a higher equilibrium binding affinity for insulin-like growth factor-II. The equilibrium binding affinities of a series of insulin-like growth factor-II mutants were also explained by differential dissociation kinetics. O-glycosylation had a small effect on the association kinetics of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-6. The insulin-like growth factor binding properties of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-6 are explained by differential dissociation kinetics.
10521443	Insulin antiapoptotic signaling involves insulin activation of the nuclear factor kappaB-dependent survival genes encoding tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 and manganese-superoxide dismutase.	We recently showed that the antiapoptotic function of insulin requires nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation (Bertrand, F., Atfi, A., Cadoret, A., L'Allemain, G., Robin, H., Lascols, O., Capeau, J., and Cherqui, G. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 2931-2938). Here we sought to identify the NF-kappaB-dependent survival genes that are activated by insulin to mediate this function. Insulin increased the expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) mRNA and protein in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing insulin receptors (IRs). This effect required (i) IR activation since it was abrogated by IR mutation at tyrosines 1162 and 1163 and (ii) NF-kappaB activation since it was abolished by overexpression of dominant-negative IkappaB-alpha(A32/36) and mimicked by overexpression of the NF-kappaB c-Rel subunit. TRAF2 contributed to insulin protection against serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis since TRAF2 overexpression mimicked insulin protection, whereas overexpression of dominant-negative TRAF2-(87-501) reduced this process. Along with its protective effect, overexpressed TRAF2 increased basal and insulin-stimulated NF-kappaB activities. All effects were inhibited by IkappaB-alpha(A32/36), suggesting that an amplification loop involving TRAF2 activation of NF-kappaB is implicated in insulin antiapoptotic signaling. We also show that insulin increased manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) mRNA expression through NF-kappaB activation and that Mn-SOD contributed to insulin antiapoptotic signaling since expression of antisense Mn-SOD RNA decreased this process. This study provides the first evidence that insulin activates the NF-kappaB-dependent survival genes encoding TRAF2 and Mn-SOD and thereby clarifies the role of NF-kappaB in the antiapoptotic function of insulin.
10727985	Lack of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) in the basal keratinocyte layer of diabetic skin and diabetic foot ulcers.	Wound healing, including re-epithelialization, is delayed in diabetes. Growth factors influence the healing process and amongst these, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) has been shown to stimulate keratinocyte proliferation in vitro. Monoclonal antibodies to insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 (IGF1 and IGF2) were used to investigate their distribution in diabetic foot ulcers and surrounding tissues by immunohistochemistry, compared with diabetic and non-diabetic uninjured skin. IGF2 was found throughout the epidermis (stratum granulosum, spinosum, and basale) in all three groups. Staining for IGF2 was intense in both normal and diabetic skin as well as in diabetic foot ulcers, being greatest at the ulcer edge. IGF1, in comparison, was found throughout the epidermis of non-diabetic skin; expression was restricted to the stratum granulosum and spinosum of uninjured diabetic skin and was absent in the basal layer at the ulcer edge. A similar absence of IGF1 in dermal fibroblasts was found in tissue sections from diabetic patients. This lack of expression of IGF1 within the basal layer and fibroblasts may contribute to retarded wound healing in diabetes mellitus.
10840365	Insulin and glucocorticoid-dependent suppression of the IGF-I system in diabetic wounds.	BACKGROUND: Growth-promoting polypeptides, including insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), orchestrate different biochemical events that culminate in the restoration of functional integrity of wounded skin. The nonhealing cutaneous wound is a well-documented phenomenon in experimental and clinical diabetes. Accordingly, we undertook this study to ascertain whether diabetes impairs the healing process by suppressing the wound microenvironmental IGF-I system (eg, IGF-I; IGF-I receptor [IGF-I R]; and IGF-I binding protein [IGF-BP(3)]). METHODS: The induction of diabetes was achieved by the intravenous injection of streptozotocin at a dose of 55 mg/kg. Subcutaneously implanted polyvinyl alcohol sponge and stainless steel mesh chamber models were used to study wound healing. Nondiabetic and diabetic animals received, respectively, subcutaneous 30-day time-release pellets of glucocorticoid (200 mg) and mifepristone (RU-486, 25 mg). Corresponding control animals received placebo pellets. Polyvinyl alcohol sponge and wound fluid expression of the IGF-I system were evaluated by using ligand blotting, radioimmunoassay, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-based techniques. RESULTS: Polyvinyl alcohol sponge contents of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts encoding for IGF-I, IGF-I R, and IGF-BP(3) were reduced in diabetic and glucocorticoid-treated control animals. A similar pattern of changes in protein levels of IGF-I and IGF-BP(3) occurred in wound fluid collected from these animals. Partial normalization of the associated hyperglycemic and hypercortisolemic states of diabetes with insulin (hyperglycemia) and the glucocorticoid receptor blocker RU-486 (hypercortisolemia) ameliorated the diabetes-related decrease in the IGF-I system during wound healing. CONCLUSIONS: The current data, together with data garnered from the literature, support the concept that the state of hypercortisolemia in diabetes mellitus impairs the healing process, at least in part, by suppressing the wound microenvironmental IGF-I system. Confirmation regarding this premise awaits further investigation.
11181540	The regulation of skin proliferation and differentiation in the IR null mouse: implications for skin complications of diabetes.	Impaired wound healing of skin is one of the most serious complications of diabetes. However, the pathogenesis of this process is not known, and it is unclear whether impaired insulin signaling could directly affect skin physiology. To elucidate the role of insulin in skin, we studied skin insulin receptor (IR) null mice. The morphology of the skin of newborn IR null mice was normal; however, these mice exhibited decreased proliferation of skin keratinocytes and changes in expression of skin differentiation markers. Due to the short life span of the IR null mice, further characterization was performed in cultured skin keratinocytes that can be induced to differentiate in vitro, closely following the maturation pattern of epidermis in vivo. It was found that despite a compensatory increase in the insulin-like growth factor I receptor autophosphorylation, differentiation of cultured IR null keratinocytes was markedly impaired. In vitro proliferation was not affected as much. Furthermore, although the basal glucose transport system of the null mice was not defective, the insulin-induced increase in glucose transport was abrogated. These results suggest that insulin regulates, via the IR, the differentiation and glucose transport of skin keratinocytes, whereas proliferation is affected by the diabetes milieu of IR knockout mice.
11423485	Glucose effects on skin keratinocytes: implications for diabetes skin complications.	Altered skin wound healing is a common cause of morbidity and mortality among diabetic patients. However, the molecular mechanisms whereby diabetes alters skin physiology have not been elucidated. In this study, we investigated the relative roles of hyperglycemia, insulin, and IGF-I, all of which are abnormal in diabetes, in primary murine skin keratinocytes. These cells proliferate and differentiate in vitro in a manner similar to skin in vivo. It was found that in the presence of high glucose (20 mmol/l), the glucose transport rate of primary proliferating or differentiating keratinocytes was downregulated, whereas at 2 mmol/l glucose, the transport rate was increased. These changes were associated with changes in the GLUT1 expression and with changes in the affinity constant (K(m)) of the transport. Exposure to high glucose was associated with changes in cellular morphology, as well as with decreased proliferation and enhancement of Ca(2+)-induced differentiation of keratinocytes. Furthermore, in the presence of high glucose, ligand-induced IGF-I receptor but not insulin receptor (IR) autophosphorylation was decreased. Consequently, in high glucose, the effects of IGF-I on glucose uptake and keratinocyte proliferation were inhibited. Interestingly, lack of IR expression in IR-null keratinocytes abolished insulin-induced glucose uptake and partially decreased insulin- and IGF-I-induced proliferation, demonstrating the direct involvement of the IR in these processes. Our results demonstrate that hyperglycemia and impaired insulin signaling might be directly involved in the development of chronic complications of diabetes by impairing glucose utilization of skin keratinocytes as well as skin proliferation and differentiation.
11557037	Effect of receptor phosphorylation on the binding between IRS-1 and IGF-1R as revealed by surface plasmon resonance biosensor.	A receptor binding assay based on the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor technique was developed to study the interaction between insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and its intracellular substrate protein insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). The sensor surface was modified with anti-IGF-1R (alpha-subunit) monoclonal antibodies for the capturing of the receptor-containing membrane fragments from cell lysates. The IGF-1R was successfully immobilized on the sensor surface with binding capability for its intracellular substrates. SPR measurements showed that the tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1R induced by its extracellular ligand insulin-like growth factor-1 caused the receptor to bind with IRS-1 10 times faster than the unactivated receptor. As a result, the affinity constants of IRS-1 to phosphorylated and unphosphorylated IGF-1R were (8.06+/-5.18)x10(9) M(-1) and (9.81+/-4.61)x10(8) M(-1), respectively.
7516864	Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I receptors similarly stimulate deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis despite differences in cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation.	Signal transduction pathways stimulated by insulin or insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) were compared in transfected NIH3T3 fibroblast cell lines expressing the human insulin receptor, IGF-I receptor, or a chimeric IGF-I receptor with its carboxy-terminal tail replaced with that of the insulin receptor (approximately 1 x 10(6) receptors/cell). Although receptor autophosphorylation was very similar in the three cell lines overexpressing receptors (EC50 = 1-3 nM), there were differences detected in the protein tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by insulin and IGF-I in these cells. Although no substrates specific for the insulin receptor were detected, phosphorylation of a 170-kilodalton (kDa; IRS-1) and a 70-kDa protein was 10 times more sensitive to insulin than to IGF-I (EC50 = 1.5-2.5 vs. 14-23 nM). The chimeric receptor stimulated significantly lower levels of phosphorylation of several proteins relative to the wild-type IGF-I receptor. Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase paralleled phosphorylation of the 170- and 70-kDa proteins. Despite these differences in protein tyrosine phosphorylation, stimulation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and DNA synthesis were very similar in the three cell lines overexpressing receptors. Little difference was detected in Shc phosphorylation or MAP kinase activation through the three receptors, although activation of MAP kinase was more efficiently coupled to the platelet-derived growth factor receptor than to any of the overexpressed receptors. All three receptors stimulated DNA synthesis to levels comparable to 10% serum, with similar sensitivities (EC50 = 1.5-3.5 nM).
7559507	Evidence for a differential interaction of SHC and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) with the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system.	Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, -1135, and -1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR.
9255756	Insulin receptors in mouse brain: age-related modifications are corrected by thymus graft.	Recently, we have shown that insulin receptors (InsRs) in the brain undergo impairment with aging, as happens for other receptors such as alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. Age-related alterations of adrenoceptors, which are modulated by brain InsRs, are not definitive as they can be recovered by a thymus graft. In this study we verified the possibility that the thymus graft can also recover the age-dependent modifications of brain InsRs. InsR characteristics were assayed in a group of 27 months old Balb/c-nu mice grafted with a neonatal thymus, under renal capsule, one month before the animals were killed. Another two groups of young (3 months) and old (27 months) mice were used as controls. A two-sites model analysis of receptor data confirmed the age-dependent decrease of InsR density previously observed in the high affinity population. Furthermore, a statistically significant recovery of this impairment was shown in thymus grafted animals. The low affinity receptor subset also showed some differences among the three animal models; however, they were not statistically significant. Thymus graft induced recovery of the age-related changes found in brain InsRs, together with the similar one observed on the adrenergic system, calls for deeper studies of their interaction and the role they can play on aging processes.
9281335	Growth-promoting interaction of IGF-II with the insulin receptor during mouse embryonic development.	Genetic analyses of dwarfing phenotypes resulting from targeted mutagenesis of the genes encoding the insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) and their cognate type 1 IGF receptor (IGF1R) have demonstrated that this signaling system is a major determinant of mouse embryonic growth. Of the two IGF ligands, IGF-I interacts exclusively with IGF1R, whereas IGF-II recognizes an additional receptor (XR), because the growth retardation of embryos lacking both IGR1R and IGF-II (30% of normal birthweight) is more severe than that manifested in either class of single Igf1r or Igf2 null mutants (45 and 60% of normal, respectively). To determine whether XR is the insulin receptor (IR), we examined embryos nullizygous for both Igf1r and Insr. While the growth of embryos lacking solely IR is affected very mildly and only at the end of gestation, concomitant absence of IGF1R results in a severe growth-deficiency phenotype (30% of normal size at birth) that is first detected at Embryonic Day 13.5 and is also characterized by transient edema, curly tail, generalized organ hypoplasia, including the muscles, developmental delays in ossification, and thin epidermis. The Igf1r/Insr double nullizygotes are phenotypically indistinguishable from double mutants lacking IGF1R and IGF-II and from other double and triple mutants in which all of the IGF ligand/receptor interactions have been eliminated. Therefore, these results provide genetic evidence that the growth-promoting function of IGF-II during mouse embryogenesis is mediated in part by signaling through the insulin receptor.
10886503	Differential roles of insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor in differentiation of murine skin keratinocytes.	The insulin receptor and the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor are widely expressed tyrosine kinases that mediate insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling. Both receptors are expressed in many cells in which insulin stimulation does not result in an increase in glucose transport, and the distinct role of the insulin receptor in these tissues, is not known. We have studied the regulation of insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor in the differentiation of cultured murine keratinocytes. Both receptors are expressed in skin keratinocytes and their expression was unchanged in all stages of calcium-induced differentiation. Insulin binding to skin keratinocytes, however, increased during calcium-induced differentiation, whereas insulin-like growth factor-1 binding decreased. Ligand-induced autophosphorylation was also changed during differentiation. In proliferating keratinocytes both receptors became phosphorylated upon ligand binding, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor to a greater extent. Terminal differentiation resulted in a decrease in insulin receptor autophosphorylation, whereas insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor autophosphorylation was abolished. There was no change in the cellular localization of the proteins, their intrinsic activity, or their internal structure. Finally, due to the change in the receptor's activity during keratinocyte differentiation, the role of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 in the differentiation process was examined. The expected increase in the expression of keratins 1 and 10 during calcium-induced differentiation was facilitated in the presence of insulin, whereas this induction was inhibited in the presence of insulin-like growth factor-1. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling pathways are differentially involved in skin differentiation, suggesting that abnormal insulin signaling, as occurs in diabetes, may lead to skin pathology.
11262195	Loss of insulin-like growth factor II receptor expression promotes growth in cancer by increasing intracellular signaling from both IGF-I and insulin receptors.	The insulin-like growth factor-II receptor (IGF-IIR) is frequently mutated or deleted in some malignant human tumors, suggesting that the IGF-IIR is a tumor suppressor. However, the exact mechanism by which IGF-IIR suppresses growth in tumors has not been definitively established. We demonstrate that IGF-IIR-deficient murine L cells (D9) have higher growth rates than IGF-IIR-positive L cells (Cc2) in response to IGF-II. IGF-II levels are higher in growth-conditioned medium from D9 versus Cc2 cells. Receptor neutralization studies and measurements of insulin receptor substrate 1 phosphorylation confirm that the enhanced growth of D9 cells is due to increased stimulation of the IGF-I and insulin receptors by IGF-II. In contrast, the levels of secreted latent and active transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) are similar for both D9 and Cc2 cells, indicating that the slower growth of Cc2 cells is not due to activation of latent TGF-beta by IGF-IIR and growth inhibition. The results directly demonstrate that down regulation of the IGF-IIR promotes the growth of transformed D9 cells by sustaining IGF-II, which binds to and activates IGF-IR and insulin receptor to increase intracellular growth signals.
7895674	A functional assessment of insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I hybrid receptors.	Insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) hybrid receptors are composed of an alpha beta-heterodimer from an insulin receptor and an alpha beta-heterodimer from an IGF-I receptor. In this study, we evaluate the effect of insulin receptor overexpression on hybrid formation. The more human insulin receptors expressed in rodent fibroblasts, the greater the percentage of endogenous rat IGF-I receptors that form hybrid receptors. The IGF-I receptor in rodent fibroblasts has two receptor isoforms, one with a 95-kilodalton (kDa) beta-subunit and one with an 105 kDa beta-subunit. A truncated mutant insulin receptor was used to demonstrate that only activated IGF-I receptors with the 105-kDa beta-subunit form hybrid receptors with the insulin receptor. Insulin/IGF-I hybrid receptors with a kinase-defective insulin heterodimer undergo trans and a small amount of cis autophosphorylation, but overall autophosphorylation is markedly decreased from that seen in hybrids with a kinase-competent insulin receptor. The kinase-defective insulin receptor heterodimer functions as a dominant-negative, inhibiting phosphorylation by the kinase-competent IGF-I receptor heterodimer. The kinase-defective hybrid receptors are, however, able to undergo internalization. Despite an increasing percentage of insulin/IGF-I hybrid receptors in the three cell lines studied, the rates of IGF-I internalization and degradation remain similar to those mediated by the IGF-I receptor and distinct from those of insulin receptor heterotetramers. In conclusion, IGF-I-stimulated insulin/IGF-I hybrid receptors function like IGF-I receptors, rather than like insulin receptors.
9600271	Insulin receptor-deficient cells as a new tool for dissecting complex interplay in insulin and insulin-like growth factors.	Cell systems derived from knockout mice for the insulin receptor (IR) or the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) represent unique tools for dissecting complex interplay in the actions of insulin and insulin-like growth factors through their cognate versus non-cognate receptor. In this study, we used a fibroblast cell line derived from IR-deficient mice to investigate metabolic and mitogenic effects of IGF-1 and insulin. IGF-1 was able to stimulate glucose uptake, glucose incorporation into glycogen and thymidine incorporation in such cells. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase, two enzymes of major metabolic-mitogenic signaling pathways, were activated upon stimulating these cells with IGF-1. All these effects were also achieved when IR-deficient cells were stimulated with insulin. Thus, IGF-1R can represent an alternative receptor through which insulin might exert some of its effects.
9737339	Insulin receptor expression in primary and cultured osteoclast-like cells.	Skeletal growth is the net product of coordinated bone formation and resorption. Insulin is known to stimulate bone formation by actions on osteoblasts. It is not known whether insulin receptors are present on osteoclasts, or whether insulin regulates osteoclastic function. We present here immunocytochemical evidence of insulin receptor expression by mature mono- and multinucleated murine osteoclast-like cells generated in vitro, and in primary neonatal rat and mouse osteoclasts. Radiolabeled studies indicated that progressive enrichment of osteoclast-like cells in coculture was associated with increased insulin binding. When osteoclast-like cells generated in vitro were plated onto dentine slices, insulin dose-dependently inhibited pit formation by up to 80%, suggesting a role for insulin in osteoclast function. These data are consistent with an effect of insulin on bone resorption in addition to those previously recognized on bone formation, actions that together result in net bone growth.
11923875	beta-cell-specific deletion of the Igf1 receptor leads to hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance but does not alter beta-cell mass.	Regulation of glucose homeostasis by insulin depends on the maintenance of normal beta-cell mass and function. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) has been implicated in islet development and differentiated function, but the factors controlling this process are poorly understood. Pancreatic islets produce Igf1 and Igf2, which bind to specific receptors on beta-cells. Igf1 has been shown to influence beta-cell apoptosis, and both Igf1 and Igf2 increase islet growth; Igf2 does so in a manner additive with fibroblast growth factor 2 (ref. 10). When mice deficient for the Igf1 receptor (Igf1r(+/-)) are bred with mice lacking insulin receptor substrate 2 (Irs2(-/-)), the resulting compound knockout mice show a reduction in mass of beta-cells similar to that observed in pancreas of Igf1r(-/-) mice (ref. 11), suggesting a role for Igf1r in growth of beta-cells. It is possible, however, that the effects in these mice occur secondary to changes in vascular endothelium or in the pancreatic ductal cells, or because of a decrease in the effects of other hormones implicated in islet growth. To directly define the role of Igf1, we have created a mouse with a beta-cell-specific knockout of Igf1r (betaIgf1r(-/-)). These mice show normal growth and development of beta-cells, but have reduced expression of Slc2a2 (also known as Glut2) and Gck (encoding glucokinase) in beta-cells, which results in defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and impaired glucose tolerance. Thus, Igf1r is not crucial for islet beta-cell development, but participates in control of differentiated function.
12643137	The role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in diabetes and obesity.	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) is a nuclear receptor, which upon activation with various natural and synthetic ligands, stimulates the transcription of genes responsible for growth and differentiation of adipocytes. Furthermore, PPAR gamma is the receptor for the insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones, which are commonly used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Rare inactivating mutations of the gene encoding PPAR gamma are associated with insulin resistance type 2 diabetes, and hypertension, whereas a rare gain of function mutation causes extreme obesity. A common polymorphism (Pro12Ala) of the adipose tissue-specific gamma 2 isoform is associated with increased insulin sensitivity and decreased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. These findings indicate a central role of PPAR gamma in fat cell biology and in the pathophysiology of obesity, diabetes, and insulin resistance.
12960057	Growth factor-specific regulation of insulin receptor substrate-1 expression in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells: effects on the insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway.	IGFs are potent mitogens that play a crucial role in cell proliferation and/or differentiation and tumorigenesis. Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is a key protein in the IGF signaling pathway in the estrogen-dependent MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line. In this study, three growth factors [fibroblast growth factor (FGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)] were tested for their ability to modulate IRS-1 protein expression and the IGF-I signaling pathway. FGF and, to a lesser extent, EGF were found to increase IRS-1 protein, whereas PDGF had no effect. This indicates that growth factors can specifically modulate IRS-1 protein content. The increases provoked by EGF and FGF were dependent on the MAPK signaling pathway but independent of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) signaling and required de novo protein synthesis. We noted that the kinetics of MAPK activation was continuous in response to FGF but transient in response to EGF. In addition, transfection of cells with a constitutively active form of MAPK kinase, which results in continuous MAPK activity, increased IRS-1 expression. Taken together, these results suggest that stimulation of IRS-1 expression was therefore stronger when MAPK activity was sustained. Pretreatment of cells with EGF, FGF, or PDGF for 24 h reduced IGF-I-induced tyrosine phosphorylation per molecule of IRS-1. However, IGF-I-induced PI 3-kinase activity was decreased by 24 h of pretreatment with EGF or PDGF but not with FGF. Our results therefore demonstrate that different growth factors are capable of specifically modulating the IGF-I signaling via IRS-1. They further suggest that the FGF-induced increase in IRS-1 counterbalances the inhibition of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation to allow normal stimulation of IGF-I-induced PI 3-kinase activity.
14560955	TOR action in mammalian cells and in Caenorhabditis elegans.	The p70 S6 kinase (p70 S6K) was the first signaling element in mammalian cells shown to be inhibited by rapamycin. The activity of the p70 S6K in mammalian cell is upregulated by extracellular amino acids (especially leucine) and by signals from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), primarily through activation of the type 1A PI-3 kinase. The amino acid-/rapamycin-sensitive input and the PI-3 kinase input are co-dominant but largely independent, in that deletion of the amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal noncatalytic sequences flanking the p70 S6K catalytic domain renders the kinase insensitive to inhibition by both rapamycin and by withdrawal of amino acids, whereas this p70 S6K mutant remains responsive to activation by RTKs and to inhibition by wortmannin. At a molecular level, this dual control of p70 S6K activity is attributable to phosphorylation of the two p70 S6K sites: The Ptd Ins 3,4,5P3-dependent kinasel (PDK1) phosphorylates p70 S6K at a Thr on the activation loop, whereas mTOR phosphorylates a Thr located in a hydrophobic motif carboxyterminal to the catalytic domain. Together these two phosphorylations engender a strong, positively cooperative activation of p70 S6K, so that each is indispensable for physiologic regulation. Like RTKs, the p70 S6K appears early in metazoan evolution and comes to represent an important site at which the more ancient, nutrient-responsive TOR pathway converges with the RTK/PI-3 kinase pathway in the control of cell growth. Dual regulation of p70 S6K is seen in Drosophila; however, this convergence is not yet evident in Caenorhabditis elegans, wherein nutrient activation of the insulin receptor (InsR) pathway negatively regulates dauer development and longevity, whereas the TOR pathway regulates overall mRNA translation through effectors distinct from p70 S6K, as in yeast. The C. elegans TOR and InsR pathways show none of the cross- or convergent regulation seen in mammalian cells. The nature of the elements that couple nutrient sufficiency to TOR activity remain to be discovered, and the mechanisms by which RTKs influence TOR activity in mammalian cells require further study. One pathway for RTK control involves the tuberous sclerosis complex, which is absent in C. elegans, but of major importance in Drosophila and higher metazoans.
7520401	Molecular and functional characterization of insulin receptors present on hamster glucagonoma cells.	Studies using pancreas perfusion techniques point to a physiological inhibition of glucagon release by insulin which should be mediated by A cell-residing insulin receptors. In this study, we have characterized the insulin receptors expressed in a hamster glucagonoma A cell line (INR1G9 cells) which is an accepted tool for A cell studies. In receptor binding assays 125I-insulin was displaced with a Kd of 3 nmol/l. Binding was also dependent upon time, temperature and cell number. Insulin concentration-dependently inhibited glucagon secretion (1 mumol: 59%, 100 nmol/l: 71%, 10 nmol/l: 86% of controls). In transient transfection experiments insulin inhibited proglucagon gene transcription (controls: 100%, 100 nmol/l: 54%, 10 nmol/l: 57%, 1 nmol/l: 72%, 100 pmol/l: 96%). Treatment of INR1G9 cells with insulin for 20 h induced a strong downregulation of insulin receptors (controls: 100%, 100 nmol/l: 30%, 10 nmol/l: 70%, 1 nmol/l: 73%, 100 pmol/l: 75%) and of insulin receptor mRNA levels (controls: 100%, 100 nmol/l: 42%, 10 nmol/l: 82%, 1 nmol/l: 84%, 100 pmol/l: 90%). When INR1G9 cells were transiently transfected with a hybrid gene containing the promotor/enhancer region of the human insulin receptor promotor (1,462 bp) linked to the transcriptional reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and were treated with insulin it was demonstrated that insulin did not affect the insulin receptor gene transcription. In conclusion, INR1G9 cells express specific receptors for insulin. Insulin inhibits glucagon secretion and proglucagon gene expression via an inhibition of proglucagon gene transcription. Ligand-induced downregulation of the insulin receptor is not mediated by changes of insulin receptor gene transcription and is most likely regulated by posttranscriptional mechanisms, e.g. destabilization of insulin receptor mRNA.
7530043	Direct determination of the sequence recognition requirements of the SH2 domains of SH-PTP2.	SH-PTP2 is a widely-expressed protein tyrosine phosphatase with two tandem SH2 (src homology 2) domains and a C-terminal catalytic domain. Glutathione S-transferase fusions of the SH2 domains alone and of a catalytically inactive full-length mutant were made, and binding assays were developed using the purified fusion proteins to directly determine what residues are involved in the recognition of binding targets by the SH2 domains. The binding kinetics of the SH2 domains to a phosphotyrosyl-containing peptide of the sequence surrounding Tyr1009 of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) beta subunit [DTSSVL(pY)TAVQPN] were determined by surface plasmon resonance, confirming that this is a high-affinity binding ligand. Using various N- and C-terminal truncations of this peptide as competitors in the binding assays, the minimum peptide that served as a high-affinity binding ligand was found to be VL(pY)TAV. Systematic Ala substitutions of this peptide indicated that in addition to the phosphotyrosine (pY), the critical residues for recognition and binding are at pY + 1 and pY + 3 as previously reported, and notably at pY-2 as well. Binding competition results with these and other PDGFR, IRP, and IRS-1 peptides suggested some general rules for sequence recognition by the SH2 domains of SH-PTP2. Peptides that bind to the SH2 domains in the binding assays were also found to stimulate the phosphatase activity of SH-PTP2.
7983794	[Classification of mutations in the insulin receptor gene].	Mutations in the insulin receptor gene can cause insulin resistance by interfering with a step (s) in the life cycle of the insulin receptor. These steps include biosynthesis, posttranslational modifications and transport to plasma membrane, ligand binding, trans membrane signaling, and endocytosis, recycling and degradation. Mutations are functionally classified into five classes: mutations that decrease the rate of receptor biosynthesis (class I), mutations that impair intracellular transport and post-translational processing (class II), mutations that cause defects in insulin binding (class III), mutations that impair receptor tyrosine kinase activity (class IV), and mutations that accelerate receptor degradation (class V). Examples of insulin receptor gene mutations for each of these five classes are shown.
8903422	Effect of growth factors on estrogen receptor mediated gene expression.	The proliferation of mammary carcinoma cells can be stimulated by estrogens and various growth factors such as EGF and IGF-I. Steroid hormones and growth factors are understood to exert their effects via different receptors and signal transduction pathways. Recently, it has been shown that growth factors can utilize the unliganded estrogen receptor (ER) as a transcription factor. This study was aimed at identifying the growth factors that can act via the estrogen receptor, and finding new estrogen antagonists that block this activity. Originally, a transcription assay was used in which HeLa cells had been transiently co-transfected with the expression vector for the human ER and a reporter plasmid EREwtc luc. EGF and, to a lesser extent, insulin stimulated the expression of the reporter gene in the absence of estradiol (E2), whereas IGF-I was inactive. The stimulatory effect of E2 and insulin was suppressed when the ER was blocked by the pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780. In ER-positive MCF-7 cells, transfected transiently with the reporter plasmid, EGF had no stimulatory effect on luciferase expression. IGF-I stimulated the transcription to about 50% of the E2 value. Similar activity was found for insulin. The effect of both growth factors was only partly reversed by the addition of a pure antiestrogen. The combination of E2 and IGF-I or insulin led to a synergistic activation of transcription. Because transiently transfected cells do not allow one to study the influence of chromatin structure on gene expression, an MCF-7 subline (MCF-7/2a) was established, in which the reporter construct had been integrated in the genome. IGF-I stimulated luciferase expression in these cells, but showed no overadditive effect with E2. The effects of both agents were completely suppressed by the pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780. These data suggest the existence of an ER-independent mechanism for the activation of the reporter gene in transiently transfected cells, but not in stable transfectants.
9062339	The adapter protein Grb10 associates preferentially with the insulin receptor as compared with the IGF-I receptor in mouse fibroblasts.	To identify receptor-associated proteins that may contribute to the specificity of insulin and IGF-I signaling responses, a mouse embryo library was screened using the yeast two-hybrid system. Multiple receptor-interactive clones encoding the SH2 domain of the adapter protein Grb10 were isolated. Subsequent cloning of the full-length Grb10 sequence from a mouse fat cDNA library defined a previously unknown Grb10 variant, that appears to be the predominant isoform in mouse tissues. Receptor-deficient R- cells (fibroblasts from mice with homologous disruption of the IGF-I receptor gene) and transfected R- cells expressing either insulin receptors (R-IR cells) or IGF-I receptors (R+ cells) were used to investigate the specificity of Grb10 interaction with the two related receptors. Hormone-activated insulin receptors in R-IR cells coprecipitated with three species, all recognized as Grb10 isoforms by specific Grb10 antibody. Under the same conditions, Grb10 was essentially undetectable in IGF-I receptor immunoprecipitates from stimulated R+ cells. Grb10 association with insulin receptors was maximal at 10 nM insulin stimulation and sustained from 5-10 min after hormone stimulation in R-IR cells. In conclusion, Grb10 interacts preferentially with insulin vs. IGF-I receptors in intact cells and, thus, may have a role in mediating insulin receptor-specific cellular responses.
9831246	Identification of structural characteristics that contribute to a difference in antiapoptotic function between human insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors.	To determine whether potentiation of cell survival is an intrinsic function among the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family, we compared the ability of insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-IR) cytoplasmic tails to attenuate apoptosis. Expression and activation of IGF-IR, in interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent 32Dcl.3 cells, prevents death under conditions of IL-3 withdrawal. In contrast, a chimeric receptor comprising the extracellular portion of IGF-IR fused to the cytoplasmic tail of IR (chIR) fails to promote cell survival when activated with ligand. Both chIR and IGF-IR exhibit comparable levels of enzymatic activity as evidenced by their ability to autophosphorylate and transphosphorylate the shc protein in vivo. Both chIR and IGF-IR can activate the MAPK signal transduction pathway; however, neither RTK is capable of promoting mitogenesis in the absence of IRS proteins. Structure function analysis of the IR cytoplasmic tail reveals that replacing the COOH-terminal 94 amino acids of the IR cytoplasmic tail with the comparable sequence from IGF-IR confers full antiapoptotic function. Furthermore, mutation of only two amino acids within IR, Phe-1264 and His-1265 to tyrosine (chIR/YY) is sufficient to impart a cell survival activity comparable to wild-type IGF-IR. Amino acid residues Phe-1264 and His-1265 of IR are in a region comparable to Tyr-1250 and Tyr-1251 within human IGF-IR. The amino acid sequence of IR from other species contains at least one tyrosine residue in this region, suggesting that differences in antiapoptotic function we observed may represent a characteristic unique to human members of this RTK family. The ability of IGF-IR or chIR/YY to prevent apoptosis is not blocked by addition of the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. These studies define a critical region responsible for mediating cell survival through a novel interaction that is independent of mitogenesis.
10454568	Grb10, a positive, stimulatory signaling adapter in platelet-derived growth factor BB-, insulin-like growth factor I-, and insulin-mediated mitogenesis.	Grb10 has been described as a cellular partner of several receptor tyrosine kinases, including the insulin receptor (IR) and the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor (IGF-IR). Its cellular role is still unclear and a positive as well as an inhibitory role in mitogenesis depending on the cell context has been implicated. We have tested other mitogenic receptor tyrosine kinases as putative Grb10 partners and have identified the activated forms of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor beta (PDGFRbeta), hepatocyte growth factor receptor (Met), and fibroblast growth factor receptor as candidates. We have mapped Y771 as a PDFGRbeta site that is involved in the association with Grb10 via its SH2 domain. We have further investigated the putative role of Grb10 in mitogenesis with four independent experimental strategies and found that all consistently suggested a role as a positive, stimulatory signaling adaptor in normal fibroblasts. (i) Complete Grb10 expression from cDNA with an ecdysone-regulated transient expression system stimulated PDGF-BB-, IGF-I, and insulin- but not epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced DNA synthesis in an ecdysone dose-responsive fashion. (ii) Microinjection of the (dominant-negative) Grb10 SH2 domain interfered with PDGF-BB- and insulin-induced DNA synthesis. (iii) Alternative experiments were based on cell-permeable fusion peptides with the Drosophila antennapedia homeodomain which effectively traverse the plasma membrane of cultured cells. A cell-permeable Grb10 SH2 domain similarly interfered with PDGF-BB-, IGF-I-, and insulin-induced DNA synthesis. In contrast, a cell-permeable Grb10 Pro-rich putative SH3 domain binding region interfered with IGF-I- and insulin- but not with PDGF-BB- or EGF-induced DNA synthesis. (iv) Transient overexpression of complete Grb10 increased whereas cell-permeable Grb10 SH2 domain fusion peptides substantially decreased the cell proliferation rate (as measured by cell numbers) in normal fibroblasts. These experimental strategies independently suggest that Grb10 functions as a positive, stimulatory, mitogenic signaling adapter in PDGF-BB, IGF-I, and insulin action. This function appears to involve the Grb10 SH2 domain, a novel sequence termed BPS, and the Pro-rich putative SH3 domain binding region in IGF-I- and insulin-mediated mitogenesis. In contrast, PDGF-BB-mediated mitogenesis appears to depend on the SH2 but not on the Pro-rich region and may involve other, unidentified Grb10 domains. Distinct protein domains may help to define specific Grb10 functions in different signaling pathways.
11113178	Insulin receptor substrate 3 (IRS-3) and IRS-4 impair IRS-1- and IRS-2-mediated signaling.	To investigate the roles of insulin receptor substrate 3 (IRS-3) and IRS-4 in the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling cascade, we introduced these proteins into 3T3 embryonic fibroblast cell lines prepared from wild-type (WT) and IRS-1 knockout (KO) mice by using a retroviral system. Following transduction of IRS-3 or IRS-4, the cells showed a significant decrease in IRS-2 mRNA and protein levels without any change in the IRS-1 protein level. In these cell lines, IGF-1 caused the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of all four IRS proteins. However, IRS-3- or IRS-4-expressing cells also showed a marked decrease in IRS-1 and IRS-2 phosphorylation compared to the host cells. This decrease was accounted for in part by a decrease in the level of IRS-2 protein but occurred with no significant change in the IRS-1 protein level. IRS-3- or IRS-4-overexpressing cells showed an increase in basal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and basal Akt phosphorylation, while the IGF-1-stimulated levels correlated well with total tyrosine phosphorylation level of all IRS proteins in each cell line. IRS-3 expression in WT cells also caused an increase in IGF-1-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation and egr-1 expression ( approximately 1.8- and approximately 2.4-fold with respect to WT). In the IRS-1 KO cells, the impaired mitogenic response to IGF-1 was reconstituted with IRS-1 to supranormal levels and was returned to almost normal by IRS-2 or IRS-3 but was not improved by overexpression of IRS-4. These data suggest that IRS-3 and IRS-4 may act as negative regulators of the IGF-1 signaling pathway by suppressing the function of other IRS proteins at several steps.
11378333	Up-regulation of putative hyaluronan synthase mRNA by basic fibroblast growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1 in human skin fibroblasts.	Recently, cDNAs for the three putative human hyaluronan synthase (HAS) genes, HAS1, HAS2 and HAS3, have been cloned. In this study we investigated the effects of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) on the expression of HAS genes in cultured skin fibroblasts. Northern blot analyses showed that treatment of fibroblasts with bFGF enhanced the mRNA levels of all three genes. HAS2 gene expression showed the strongest up-regulation with a more than 10-fold increase at 50 ng/ml of bFGF. bFGF also increased hyaluronan production. Incubation of fibroblasts with IGF-1 increased HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3 mRNA levels, as well as hyaluronan production. Our results suggest that up-regulation of the HAS genes by bFGF and IGF-1 is closely associated with the stimulation of hyaluronan synthesis, and that effects of growth factors on HAS gene expression may have important implications for tissue remodeling, such as in development and wound healing.
9468528	Insulin-like growth factor-I receptor internalization regulates signaling via the Shc/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, but not the insulin receptor substrate-1 pathway.	Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptors activate divergent signaling pathways by phosphorylating multiple cellular proteins, including insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and the Shc proteins. Following hormone binding, IGF-I receptors cluster into clathrin-coated pits and are internalized via an endocytotic mechanism. This study investigates the relationship between IGF-I receptor internalization and signaling via IRS-1 and Shc. A mutation in the C terminus of the IGF-I receptor decreased both the rate of receptor internalization and IGF-I-stimulated Shc phosphorylation by more than 50%, but did not affect IRS-1 phosphorylation. Low temperature (15 degrees C) decreased IGF-I receptor internalization and completely inhibited Shc phosphorylation. Although receptor and IRS-1 phosphorylation were decreased in accordance with delayed binding kinetics at 15 degrees C, the ratio of IRS-1 to receptor phosphorylation was increased more than 2-fold. Dansylcadaverine decreased receptor internalization and Shc phosphorylation, but did not change receptor or IRS-1 phosphorylation. Consistent with these findings, dansylcadaverine inhibited IGF-I-stimulated Shc-Grb2 association, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase activation, but did not affect the association of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase with IRS-1 or activation of p70 S6 kinase. These data support the concept that Shc/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation requires IGF-I receptor internalization, whereas the IRS-1 pathway is activated by both cell surface and endosomal receptors.
9761714	Genetic engineering in mice: impact on insulin signalling and action.	The expression of a number of genes encoding key players in insulin signalling and action, including insulin, insulin receptor (IR), downstream signalling molecules such as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and IRS-2, glucose transporters (GLUT4, GLUT2) and important metabolic enzymes such as glucokinase, has now been altered in transgenic or knockout mice. Such mice presented with phenotypes ranging from mild defects, revealing complementarity between key molecules or pathways, to severe diabetes with ketoacidosis and early postnatal death. Insulin action could also be improved by overproduction of proteins acting at regulatory steps. The development of diabetes by combining mutations, which alone do not lead to major metabolic alterations, validated the 'diabetogenes' concept of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Genes encoding insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) and their type I receptor (IGF-IR) have also been disrupted. It appears that although IR and IGF-IR are both capable of metabolic and mitogenic signalling, they are not fully redundant. However, IR could replace IGF-IR if efficiently activated by IGF-II. Studies with cell lines lacking IR or IGF-IR lend support to such conclusions. Concerning the issues of specificity and redundancy, studies with cell lines derived from IRS-1-deficient mice showed that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are also not completely interchangeable.
7527123	Increased low density lipoprotein receptor expression mediated through the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor in cultured fibroblasts.	Plasma insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels are inversely correlated with apolipoprotein B and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in humans. To identify a molecular basis for this observation, the effects of IGF-I on LDL receptor expression in fibroblasts were studied. IGF-I increased LDL receptors in cultured human skin fibroblasts at concentrations greater than 25 ng/ml. However, IGF-I effects were not easily quantitated due to secretion of inhibitory IGF-binding proteins by the cells. To circumvent this difficulty, QAYL, an IGF-I analog that binds to the IGF-I receptor but not to IGF-binding proteins, was used. QAYL increased LDL receptor number 56-72% with half-maximum effect at 0.6 ng/ml. alpha-IR3, a monoclonal antibody directed toward the IGF-I receptor, blocked this effect. QAYL treatment increased synthesis of LDL receptor protein without increasing LDL receptor mRNA levels or altering protein stability. Both QAYL and IGF-I increased LDL receptors prominently in cells that had been treated with physiological amounts of LDL cholesterol. IGF-I, acting through the IGF-I receptor and modulated by IGF-binding proteins, may contribute to the regulation of LDL metabolism by increasing translation of LDL receptor message.
8969279	The dominant negative effect of a kinase-defective insulin receptor on insulin-like growth factor-I-stimulated signaling in Rat-1 fibroblasts.	To study the interaction between insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor (IGF-IR) tyrosine kinases, we examined IGF-I action in Rat-1 cells expressing a naturally occurring tyrosine kinase-deficient mutant IR (Asp 1048 IR). IGF-I normally stimulated receptor autophosphorylation, IRS-I phosphorylation, and glycogen synthesis in cells expressing Asp 1048 IR. However, the Asp 1048 IR inhibited IGF-I-stimulated thymidine uptake by 45% to 52% and amino acid uptake (aminoisobutyric acid [AIB]) by 58% in Asp 1048 IR cells. Furthermore, IGF-I-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity toward synthetic polymers, Shc phosphorylation, and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity was inhibited. The inhibition of mitogenesis and AIB uptake was restored with the amelioration of the impaired tyrosine kinase activity and Shc phosphorylation by the introduction of abundant wild-type IGF-IR in Asp 1048 IR cells. These results suggest that the Asp 1048 IR causes a dominant negative effect on IGF-IR in transmitting signals to Shc and MAP kinase activation, which leads to decreased IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis, and that the kinase-defective insulin receptor does not affect IGF-I-stimulated IRS-I phosphorylation, which leads to the normal IGF-I-stimulated glycogen synthesis.
10207105	Insulin-like growth factor I synergizes with interleukin 4 for hematopoietic cell proliferation independent of insulin receptor substrate expression.	In the present study, we investigated the potential role of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor (IGF-IR) in cell proliferation by overexpressing it in 32D myeloid progenitor cells. The overexpression of IGF-IR caused the transfectants to proliferate in response to IGF-I in the absence of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) expression. The activation of overexpressed wild-type IGF-IR, but not that of an ATP-binding mutant of IGF-IR, resulted in the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins, including SHC, Src homology 2-containing inositol-5-phosphatase, protein kinase C-delta, and Erk2. Grb2 association with SHC and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity was also enhanced in response to IGF-I stimulation. Interestingly, the stimulation of the IGF-IR transfectants with interleukin 4 (IL-4) also resulted in strong mitogenesis independent of IRS expression. Moreover, IGF-I and/or IL-4 induced long-term cell growth of the IGF-IR transfectants. IL-4 was able to synergize with IGF-I for DNA synthesis, even in the parental 32D cells and a pro-B-cell line, Baf3, indicating the physiological importance of the two growth factors in hematopoietic cell proliferation. IL-4 stimulation of the IGF-IR transfectants resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC, Erk2, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) proteins. Both IL-4 and IGF-I were able to induce c-myc early response gene expression, and this expression was maximal in the presence of both factors. Finally, we demonstrated that a MAPK kinase inhibitor was able to suppress mitogenesis of the IGF-IR transfectants in response to IGF-I and/or IL-4. Together, our results suggest that IL-4 synergizes with IGF-I for hematopoietic cell proliferation, likely through cross talk between SHC/Grb2/MAPK and STAT6 pathways and through c-myc gene up-regulation.
8248419	Postburn facial resurfacing with a split ascending neck flap.	Ninety-eight patients with postburn facial scar deformities were treated by using a split ascending neck flap. Anatomic studies and discovery of axial blood supply to the anterior of the neck are utilized, allowing for wide mobilization, thin flaps, and transfer of neck skin to the face and chest skin to the neck. By leaving the platysma muscle in situ and using vacuum drainage with a large tube in the subflap space, preservation of the chin and neck contours is obtained. There are five varieties of postburn facial scar deformities described and treated. Extensive facial deformity requires a two-stage operation. Neck skin transferred to the face by the described method preserves all natural properties. This method of facial resurfacing is preferable to other methods and is indicated for all cases of scars to the face with healthy neck skin and chest wall.
8260555	Changes in static and dynamic skin fold measurements in the first 60 hours of life: higher values following cesarean delivery.	Infants born by cesarean section (CS) have been reported to have increased intracellular and total body water and have a slower postnatal decline in cell water content compared to vaginally delivered infants. These findings support the hypothesis that delivery-related changes in water compartmentalization will result in postnatal differences in tissue compressibility. In order to test this hypothesis, static and dynamic skin fold thicknesses (SFTs) were obtained in 60 healthy, term, appropriate for gestational age infants between 1 and 60 h of life. Thirty infants were delivered vaginally and 30 by CS. Midtriceps, subscapular and abdominal skin folds were measured twice daily during the first 3 days of life. There were no differences between groups in birth weight, length, head circumference, gestational age, sex or ponderal index. Our results showed that static SFTs were significantly greater in CS than in vaginally delivered infants at birth and remained so throughout the study period. In both groups, static SFTs increased while weight decreased over time. At birth, dynamic SFTs were significantly greater in infants delivered by CS. We speculate that skin fold differences between CS and vaginal deliveries may reflect a different dynamic of perinatal body water distribution. The mechanism underlying the paradoxical increase in static SFTs in both groups is unknown.
8883943	Distribution and levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I and IGF-II) and insulin receptor binding sites in the spinal cords of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients.	The structurally related peptides, insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II), have neurotrophic properties and potentially could be of therapeutic value in human neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we compared the anatomical distribution of [125I]IGF-I, [125I]IGF-II and [125I]insulin binding sites in thoracic spinal cords from patients who died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and normal controls. For these three ligands, the greatest amounts of specific binding were located in the deeper layers of the dorsal horn > intermediate zone > lamina X > ventral horn > superficial layers of the dorsal horn > white matter of the spinal cord. Highly significant (P < 0.001) increases in the density of [125I]IGF-I and [125I]IGF-II binding were apparent in various laminae of the cord of ALS patients with increased binding being particularly evident in the ventral horn and the intermediate zone. Significant (P < 0.05) increases were also seen in lamina X and in the dorsal horn. In contrast, no significant differences in [125I]insulin binding were observed between ALS and control spinal cords. Taken together, these data reveal significant increases in both [125I]IGF-I and [125I]IGF-II binding levels in the spinal cords of ALS patients albeit to different extents. These findings may be of relevance for future therapeutic strategies aimed at slowing the progression of this chronic neurodegenerative disease, as recently suggested by the beneficial therapeutic effects of an IGF-I treatment in ALS patients.
9235956	Insulin and interleukin-4 induce desensitization to the mitogenic effects of insulin-like growth factor-I. Pivotal role for insulin receptor substrate-2.	Insulin-induced desensitization to insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) stimulated mitogenesis in bovine fibroblasts involves steps distal to IGF-I binding to its tyrosine kinase receptor. When quiescent cultures of bovine fibroblasts were stimulated with 10 nM IGF-I and total cell lysates immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, we observed a band at approximately 97 kDa, representing the beta-subunit of the IGF-I receptor, and a predominant tyrosyl-phosphorylated species migrating as a broad band between 170 and 190 kDa. The majority of proteins in this latter band were immunoprecipitated by antibodies against insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2 and not by antibodies against IRS-1. Pretreatment of bovine fibroblasts with 10 nM insulin for 48 h blocked subsequent IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis and the IGF-I-induced increase in tyrosyl-phosphorylated IRS-2. Insulin pretreatment did not alter IRS-1 or IRS-2 expression by these cells, as assessed by metabolic labeling and direct immunoblotting with IRS antibodies. The interleukin-4 (IL-4) cytokine receptor also has IRS-2 as its major substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation. Although 10 nM IL-4 was as effective as 10 nM IGF-I in stimulating IRS-2 phosphorylation, 10 nM IL-4 did not have comparable mitogenic power in these cells. Nonetheless, pretreatment of bovine fibroblasts with IL-4 inhibited IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis by 50-60%, concomitant with a decrease in IGF-I-induced IRS-2 phosphorylation. Insulin-induced desensitization could be prevented if a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (LY294002), but not an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase (PD98059), was present during the preincubation period. LY294002 also prevented the shift in IRS-2 molecular mass in response to prolonged incubation of cells with insulin. These data indicate that, in a nontransformed cell system, IRS-2 plays a key role in cellular desensitization to IGF-I-stimulated mitogenesis most likely through a feedback mechanism in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Furthermore, they suggest that signaling through IRS-2 may provide an important point of integration for hormone, growth factor, and cytokine receptor systems that regulate critical cellular growth responses.
9277380	Decreased muscle insulin receptor kinase correlates with insulin resistance in normoglycemic Pima Indians.	Defects in insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity are present in insulin-resistant non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients and certain nondiabetic individuals, both lean and obese. However, the relationship between insulin receptor function, insulin action, and obesity is unclear. To address this issue, we have employed a new and highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure in vitro insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of immunocaptured muscle insulin receptors in a group of 25 normoglycemic Pima Indians. Insulin action, determined during two-step euglycemic insulin clamps, varied widely in these subjects. Maximal in vitro insulin stimulation of insulin receptor autophosphorylation strongly correlated with both low (Mlow)- and high (Mhigh)-dose insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (r = 0.62 and 0.51, P < 0.002 and 0.011, respectively). Insulin receptor autophosphorylation was inversely related to percent body fat (r = -0.52, P < 0.009). After control for percent body fat, receptor autophosphorylation remained correlated with Mlow (partial r = 0.49, P < 0.025). These data therefore suggest that defects in insulin receptor function are major contributors to insulin resistance in both lean and obese normoglycemic Pima Indians.
10651165	Maintenance of human skin in organ culture: role for insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor.	Recent studies have shown that adult skin incubated in low-Ca2+ (0.15 mM) medium rapidly degenerates but that normal architecture is maintained when the tissue is incubated in high-Ca2+ medium (1.4 mM Ca2+). To investigate whether the skin cell-produced growth factors insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) play a role in these events, 2-mm skin punch biopsies were obtained and maintained for 8 to 10 days in a basal medium containing 0.15 mM Ca2+ with and without growth factors, or containing 1.4 mM Ca2+ with and without antibodies to the same growth factors. In parallel experiments, cultured human keratinocytes were incubated for 2 days in the same basal medium in the presence or absence of the same growth factors and antibodies. Consistent with previous reports, organ cultures incubated in the low-Ca2+ (0.15 mM) medium rapidly degenerated. Neither IGF-1 nor EGF prevented the complete degeneration of epidermis and dermis in these organ cultures. Interestingly, the addition of an anti-IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) antibody to the organ cultures maintained in high-Ca2+ medium induced changes reminiscent of those seen when the organ cultures were maintained in low-Ca2+ medium, i.e. tissue degeneration. In contrast, antibodies to EGF receptor, used for comparison, only produced focal areas of epidermal necrosis. In vitro, IGF-1 is a known mitogen for keratinocytes. In cultured human keratinocytes, anti-IGF-1R antibody partially inhibited the IGF-1-mediated stimulation of human keratinocyte proliferation without affecting normal spontaneous growth. Additionally, IGF-1R immunolocalized to basal keratinocytes in vivo, exhibited specific binding to IGF-1 in vitro. This indicated a critical role for IGF-1R in both organ cultures ex vivo and cultured cells in vitro. Messenger RNA encoding both IGF-1 and IGF-1R were readily detected by RT-PCR in organ cultures incubated in both low- and high-Ca2+ medium. There were no detectable differences in IGF-1 mRNA in organ cultures growing in the low- or high-Ca2+ medium, but lower levels of IGF-1R mRNA were observed in the organ cultures maintained in low-Ca2+ medium than in those in high Ca2+ medium. These findings are consistent with homeostatic changes in the tissue grown under different calcium concentrations. IGF-1 mRNA was detected in several skin cell populations in vitro, even though it was undetectable in cultured keratinocytes. Taken together these findings indicate that (1) the IGF-1/ IGF-1R loop is critically involved in maintenance of human skin organ cultures ex vivo, and (2) IGF-1, locally produced by skin cells other than keratinocytes, interacts with its receptor, predominantly expressed in basal keratinocytes, to maintain tissue homeostasis.
10912518	Role of insulin receptors and IGF receptors in growth and development.	Observations in targeted mouse mutants and patients with genetic abnormalities grant insight into the various and distinct roles of insulin-like growth factor receptors (IGF-Rs) and insulin receptors (IRs) during early development. While IGF-1Rs (mediating both IGF-1 and IGF-2 actions) are important for embryonic and fetal growth, IRs (mediating IGF-2 rather than insulin action) play a minor role. However, it is an oversimplification to conclude that IGF-1Rs mediate growth and IRs mediate metabolic responses. Mice lacking both IRs and IGF-1Rs are more severely growth retarded than mice lacking either receptor alone. The phenotype of combined deficiency of IRs and IGF-1Rs is similar to the phenotype caused by the absence of IGF-1 and IGF-2. This provides genetic proof that these two receptors account for the entirety of the growth promoting effects of IGF-1 and IGF-2. There is little evidence that hybrid insulin/IGF-1 receptors promote embryonic growth to a significant degree. The clinical presentation regarding severity of growth retardation and metabolic disturbances observed in animal models versus in humans may differ greatly and the reasons will be reviewed in detail.
12624425	Tissue-specific targeting of the insulin receptor gene.	The techniques to study the mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of disease processes have been revolutionized by the development of methods that allow spatiotemporal control of gene deletion or gene expression in transgenic and knockout animals. The ability to interfere with the function of a single protein in a specific tissue allows unprecedented flexibility for exploring gene function in both health and disease. The present review will summarize some of the different knockouts and transgenics generated recently to study type 2 diabetes and critically evaluate the techniques used to examine the function of the insulin receptor in two nonclassical insulin target tissues--the pancreatic islet and the central nervous system.
12948866	Alpha-lipoic acid decreases thiol reactivity of the insulin receptor and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.	Alpha-lipoic acid is known to increase insulin sensitivity in vivo and to stimulate glucose uptake into adipose and muscle cells in vitro. In this study, alpha-lipoic acid was demonstrated to stimulate the autophosphorylation of insulin receptor and glucose uptake into 3T3-L1 adipocytes by reducing the thiol reactivity of intracellular proteins. To elucidate mechanism of this effect, role of protein thiol groups and H(2)O(2) in insulin receptor autophosphorylation and glucose uptake was investigated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes following stimulation with alpha-lipoic acid. Alpha-lipoic acid or insulin treatment of adipocytes increased intracellular level of oxidants, decreased thiol reactivity of the insulin receptor beta-subunit, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, and enhanced glucose uptake. Alpha-lipoic acid or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was inhibited (i) by alkylation of intracellular, but not extracellular, thiol groups downstream of insulin receptor activation, and (ii) by diphenylene iodonium at the level of the insulin receptor autophosphorylation. alpha-Lipoic acid also inhibited protein tyrosine phosphatase activity and decreased thiol reactivity of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B. These findings indicate that oxidants produced by alpha-lipoic acid or insulin are involved in activation of insulin receptor and in inactivation of protein tyrosine phosphatases, which eventually result in elevated glucose uptake into 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
8275938	Effect of antiinsulin-like growth factor 1 on epidermal proliferation of human skin transplanted onto nude mice treated with growth hormone.	Recently it has been demonstrated that long-term administration of GH leads to increase of skin thickness. The aim of the present study was to determine whether this effect of GH is mediated by insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which enhances epidermal proliferation. In order to address this question, human split-thickness grafts obtained from aged skin were grafted onto nude mice. One group of mice was treated systemically with GH, whereas a second group was treated with intradermal graft injections of anti-IGF-1 in addition to GH. A third group received distilled water and served as a control group. Histological and autoradiographic analyses were performed before and after engraftment. The GH-treated mice showed a significant increase in epidermal proliferation measured by epidermal thickness (analysis of variance with repeated measurements, P < 0.01) and labeled index (analysis of variance, P < 0.01) as compared to the control group. The intradermal injections of anti-IGF-1 reduced significantly the proliferative stimulatory effect of GH (P < 0.01). The present study emphasizes the role of IGF-1 in the increased skin thickness observed after GH administration and provides a useful model for determining the effect of various compounds, including GH, on human skin.
8969282	Severe resistance to insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I in cells from a patient with leprechaunism as a result of two mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor.	We studied the biological properties of insulin receptors (IRs) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptors in cultured fibroblasts from a patient with leprechaunism (leprechaun Par-1). Patient cells displayed normal insulin binding capacity and affinity. Basal in vivo autophosphorylation and in vitro exogenous kinase activity of patient IRs were elevated twofold to threefold compared with control receptors, and insulin had no further effect on these processes. Moreover, patient IRs were unable to promote the stimulation of metabolic and mitogenic pathways. IR substrate-1 (IRS-1) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase tyrosine phosphorylation and glycogen and DNA synthesis were not increased in the basal state in patient fibroblasts and were also insensitive to the stimulatory effect of insulin. As for IGF-I, although binding and receptor kinase activity were normal, the ability to stimulate glycogen and DNA synthesis was altered in patient cells. Two mutant alleles of the IR gene were detected by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and direct sequencing. The maternal allele contained a point mutation in exon 18 encoding the tryptophan-for-arginine substitution at position 1092, and the paternal allele had a point mutation in exon 20 substituting lysine for glutamic acid at codon 1179. Thereby, leprechaun Par-1 was a compound heterozygote for two missense mutations located in the IR beta-subunit. The present investigation provides the first evidence that leprechaunism can be causally related to structural alterations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the IR. These alterations result in severe impairment of insulin and IGF-I action.
9175790	Identification of two novel insulin receptor mutations, Asp59Gly and Leu62Pro, in type A syndrome of extreme insulin resistance.	To elucidate genetic determinants of insulin resistance, we investigated insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) genes, in vitro IR function and in vivo insulin sensitivity in a family with Type A syndrome. Two missense IR mutations (Asp59Gly and Leu62Pro) found in the proband, resulted in reduction by 90% of insulin binding to erythrocytes, decreased receptor autophosphorylation and a dramatic reduction of insulin sensitivity. The proband and mother were heterozygote for Gly972Arg IRS-1 variant. Asp59Gly mutation, also carried by proband's brother with no consequence on insulin sensitivity, was inherited from the mother who is diabetic and insulin resistant and Leu62Pro was from the father. We conclude that severity of insulin resistance in the proband may be explained by the genetic condition of compound heterozygote for IR mutations while severe insulin resistance in the mother raises the possibility that other genetic factors, like IRS-1 polymorphisms, may contribute to the phenotypic expression of IR mutations.
12774026	Insulin receptor substrate-4 signaling in quiescent rat hepatocytes and in regenerating rat liver.	This study was designed to characterize insulin receptor substrate-4 (IRS-4) in isolated rat hepatocytes and to examine its role in liver regeneration. Subcellular fractionation revealed that 85% of IRS-4 is located at isolated hepatocyte plasma membranes. The distribution of IRS-4 among intracellular compartments remained unchanged in insulin-stimulated cells. Two bands corresponding to 145 and 138 kd were observed in immunoblotting experiments. Immunoprecipitation of hepatocyte lysates with a highly specific antibody against IRS-4 led to an insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)-dependent increase in phosphotyrosine residues of the 145-kd band. IRS-4 was found to be associated with Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [PI 3-kinase] and Src homology phosphatase [SHP-2]) and with protein kinase C zeta (PKC zeta). Insulin and IGF-1 elicited a rapid and dose-dependent binding of these 3 proteins to IRS-4. These data suggest that IRS-4 is insulin-/IGF-1-activated by phosphorylation and not by translocation, inducing the recruitment of SH2 domain-containing proteins and PKC zeta to the membrane. To evaluate the possible role of IRS-4 in liver regeneration, we also examined this system after partial hepatectomy (PH). One day after PH, IRS-1 expression increased, consistent with a stimulatory role in the regenerative process, whereas it decreased 7 days after liver resection. This drastic IRS-1 depletion occurred at the expense of increased IRS-2 and IRS-4 expression 7 days after PH. In addition, at this period of time after surgery, the in vivo insulin stimulation of remnant rat livers showed an increase in IRS-4/PI 3-kinase association. Given that 1 and 7 days after PH isolated hepatocytes responded similarly to insulin in terms of induced cell proliferation, a compensatory role is proposed for IRS-2/4 induction. In conclusion, IRS-4 is activated by insulin and IGF-1-like IRS-1 in rat hepatocytes, and the induced expression of IRS-4 is a compensatory mechanism that plays a role in conditions of liver regeneration.
7524092	Disproportionate growth in mice with Igf-2 transgenes.	Injection transgenesis was used to study the long-term effects of excess insulin-like growth factor II on mouse growth and differentiation. By using a construct in which the coding region of the mouse insulin like growth factor II gene (Igf-2) was placed under the control of a keratin gene promoter, four transgenic lines were established, all of which displayed overgrowth of the skin as judged by wrinkling. In addition to high levels of expression in the skin, transgene transcripts were also present in the alimentary canal and uterus. At most of the sites of transgene expression the cell number (DNA content) was greatly increased, indicating a local action of the excess insulin-like growth factor II on cell multiplication. Adult total live weight was slightly increased and there was no macroscopic evidence of tumor formation. The characteristics of these transgenic mice indicate distinct local and systemic actions for insulin-like growth factor II.
7906861	Serum alpha 2-HS-glycoprotein is an inhibitor of the human insulin receptor at the tyrosine kinase level.	The insulin-dependent tyrosine kinase activity (TKA) of the insulin receptor (IR) plays an essential role in insulin signaling. Thus, dysregulation of IR-TKA might be an important element in the states of insulin resistance. A phosphorylated rat hepatic glycoprotein (pp63) acting as an inhibitor of IR-TK has been described. In search of the human homolog of pp63, we isolated a cDNA clone from a human liver lambda gt11 cDNA library. DNA sequence analysis reveals identity with the mRNA product of a human gene AHSG encoding a serum protein, alpha 2-Heremans Scmid-glycoprotein (alpha 2HSG), with heretofore unknown physiological function. Northern blot analysis demonstrates a 1.8-kilobase mRNA in human liver and HepG2 hepatoma cells. alpha 2HSG, purified from human serum, specifically inhibits insulin-stimulated IR autophosphorylation in vitro and in vivo as well as exogenous substrate tyrosine phosphorylation. alpha 2HSG also inhibits both insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and the association of IRS-1 with the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase in H-35 hepatoma cells. alpha 2HSG inhibits insulin-dependent mitogenesis, but does not affect insulin-stimulated induction of the metabolic enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase. alpha 2HSG does not compete with insulin for binding to IR. Finally, the action of alpha 2HSG is specific toward the IR-TK; its effect does not extend to insulin-like growth factor-I-stimulated TKA. Our results allow us to assign a biochemical function for human alpha 2HSG, namely regulation of insulin action at the IR-TK level.
8242892	The mechanism of insulin action.	Insulin was isolated over 70 years ago, but the intracellular transduction of the insulin signal has not been elucidated. Significant progress has been made, particularly in the last 10 years, with the characterization of the insulin receptor and its intrinsic tyrosine kinase. However, no mechanism has been proposed that accounts for all the actions of insulin. Furthermore, all the mechanisms discussed in this brief overview contain major inadequacies. Despite these gaps in our knowledge, substantial evidence indicates that receptor tyrosine kinase activity is essential for insulin action and multiple pathways almost certainly participate. Hopefully, continued dissection of the signalling pathways will soon yield the mechanism of insulin action.
8550844	Human diabetes associated with defects in nuclear regulatory proteins for the insulin receptor gene.	The control of gene transcription is mediated by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (trans-acting factors) that bind to upstream regulatory elements (cis elements). We have previously identified two DNA-binding proteins that specifically interact with two unique AT-rich sequences of the 5' regulatory region of the insulin receptor gene which have in vivo promoter activity. Herein we have investigated the expression of these DNA-binding proteins in cells from two unrelated patients with insulin resistance and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In these patients, the insulin receptor gene was normal. In EBV-transformed lymphoblasts from both patients, insulin receptor mRNA levels and insulin receptor expression were decreased. The expression of nuclear-binding proteins for the 5' regulatory region of the insulin receptor gene was markedly reduced, and this defect paralleled the decrease in insulin receptor protein expression. These studies indicate that DNA-binding proteins to the regulatory region of the insulin receptor gene are important for expression of the insulin receptor. Further, they suggest that in affected individuals, defects in the expression of these proteins may cause decreased insulin receptor expression and insulin resistance.
8631859	The Fyn tyrosine kinase binds Irs-1 and forms a distinct signaling complex during insulin stimulation.	Irs-proteins link the receptors for insulin/IGF-1, growth hormones, and several interleukins and interferons to signaling proteins that contain Src homology-2 (SH2). To identify new Irs-1-binding proteins, we screened a mouse embryo expression library with recombinant [32P]Irs-1, which revealed a specific association between p59fyn and Irs-1. The SH2 domain in p59fyn bound to phosphorylated Tyr895 and Tyr1172, which are located in YXX(L/I) motifs. Mutation of p59fyn at the COOH-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation site (Tyr531) enhanced its binding to Irs-1 during insulin stimulation. Binding experiments with various SH2 protein revealed that Grb-2 was largely excluded from Irs-1 complexes containing p59fyn, whereas Grb-2 and p85 occurred in the same Irs-1 complex. By comparison with the insulin receptor, p59fyn kinase phosphorylated a unique cohort of tyrosine residues in Irs-1. These results outline a role for p59fyn or other related Src-kinases during insulin and cytokine signaling.
8798417	Interaction of a GRB-IR splice variant (a human GRB10 homolog) with the insulin and insulin-like growth factor I receptors. Evidence for a role in mitogenic signaling.	We have utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor. We identified a human cDNA that is a splice variant of the human GRB10 homolog GRB-IR, which we term GRB10/IR-SV1 (for GRB10/GRB-IR splice variant 1). The protein encoded by the GRB10/IR-SV1 cDNA contains an SH2 domain and a pleckstrin homology domain. Cloning of a full-length human cDNA revealed a predicted coding sequence that was similar to the mouse GRB10 protein, although GRB10/IR-SV1 contained an 80-amino acid deletion. The GRB10/IR-SV1 cDNA is a splice variant of the GRB-IR cDNA such that GRB10/IR-SV1 contains an intact pleckstrin homology domain and a distinct amino terminus. The interaction of GRB10/IR-SV1 with the insulin receptor and the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor is mediated by the SH2 domain, and we show that glutathione S-transferase-SH2 domain fusion proteins interact specifically in vitro with the insulin receptor derived from mammalian cells. The GRB10/IR-SV1 SH2 domain also interacted with an approximately 135-kDa phosphoprotein from unstimulated cell lysates, an interaction that decreased after insulin stimulation. We present evidence that the GRB10/IR-SV1 protein plays a functional role in insulin and IGF-I signaling by showing that microinjection of an SH2 domain fusion protein inhibited insulin- and IGF-I-stimulated mitogenesis in fibroblasts, yet had no effect on mitogenesis induced by epidermal growth factor. Our findings suggest that GRB10/IR-SV1 may serve to positively link the insulin and IGF-I receptors to an uncharacterized mitogenic signaling pathway.
9507031	p125Fak focal adhesion kinase is a substrate for the insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I tyrosine kinase receptors.	The focal adhesion kinase p125(Fak) is a widely expressed cytosolic tyrosine kinase, which is involved in integrin signaling and in signal transduction of a number of growth factors. In contrast to tyrosine kinase receptors such as the platelet-derived growth factor and the hepatocyte growth factor receptors, which induce p125(Fak) phosphorylation, insulin has been shown to promote its dephosphorylation. In this study, we compared p125(Fak) phosphorylation in insulin-stimulated cells maintained in suspension or in an adhesion state. We found that, in nonattached cells, insulin promotes p125(Fak) phosphorylation, whereas dephosphorylation occurred in attached cells. This was observed in Rat-1 fibroblasts overexpressing the insulin receptor, as well as in Hep G2 hepatocytes and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing more natural levels of insulin receptors. Insulin-induced p125(Fak) phosphorylation correlated with an increase in paxillin phosphorylation, indicating that p125(Fak) kinase activity may be stimulated by insulin. Mixing of purified insulin or insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptors with p125(Fak) resulted in an increase in p125(Fak) phosphorylation. Using a kinase-deficient p125(Fak) mutant, we found that this protein is a direct substrate of the insulin and IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinases. This view is supported by two additional findings. (i) A peptide corresponding to p125(Fak) sequence comprising amino acids 568-582, which contains tyrosines 576 and 577 of the kinase domain regulatory loop, is phosphorylated by the insulin receptor; and (ii) p125(Fak) phosphorylation by the insulin receptor is prevented by addition of this peptide. Finally, we observed that p125(Fak) phosphorylation by the receptor results in its activation. Our results show that the nature of the cross-talk between the insulin/IGF-I receptors and p125(Fak) is dependent on the cell architecture, and hence the interaction of the insulin/IGF-I signaling system with the integrin system will vary accordingly.
9032279	Differential signaling by insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and IRS-2 in IRS-1-deficient cells.	Mice made insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) deficient by targeted gene knockout exhibit growth retardation and abnormal glucose metabolism due to resistance to the actions of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and insulin (E. Araki et al., Nature 372:186-190, 1994; H. Tamemoto et al., Nature 372:182-186, 1994). Embryonic fibroblasts and 3T3 cell lines derived from IRS-1-deficient embryos exhibit no IGF-1-stimulated IRS-1 phosphorylation or IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity but exhibit normal phosphorylation of IRS-2 and Shc and normal IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase activity. IRS-1 deficiency results in a 70 to 80% reduction in IGF-1-stimulated cell growth and parallel decreases in IGF-1-stimulated S-phase entry, PI 3-kinase activity, and induction of the immediate-early genes c-fos and egr-1 but unaltered activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK 1 and ERK 2. Expression of IRS-1 in IRS-1-deficient cells by retroviral gene transduction restores IGF-1-stimulated mitogenesis, PI 3-kinase activation, and c-fos and egr-1 induction in proportion to the level of reconstitution. Increasing the level of IRS-2 in these cells by using a retrovirus reconstitutes IGF-1 activation of PI 3-kinase and immediate-early gene expression to the same degree as expression of IRS-1; however, IRS-2 overexpression has only a minor effect on IGF-1 stimulation of cell cycle progression. These results indicate that IRS-1 is not necessary for activation of ERK 1 and ERK 2 and that activation of ERK 1 and ERK 2 is not sufficient for IGF-1-stimulated activation of c-fos and egr-1. These data also provide evidence that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are not functionally interchangeable signaling intermediates for stimulation of mitogenesis despite their highly conserved structure and many common functions such as activating PI 3-kinase and early gene expression.
9212040	Major circadian variations of glucose homeostasis in a patient with Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome and primary insulin resistance due to a mutation (Cys284-->Tyr) in the insulin receptor alpha-subunit.	We have performed clinical, in vitro biochemical, and genetic studies of a patient with severe insulin resistance, considerable growth restriction, and Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (patient RM-3). The blood IGF-I level was undetectable in this patient, although the GH level was moderately decreased. During the postprandial period, glycemia, ketonuria, and plasma glucagon were very elevated despite high doses of exogenous insulin (glucose levels up to 30 mmol/L). In the postabsorptive state, blood glucose was normalized with small amounts of insulin; ketonuria, and glucagon levels were reduced but remained supranormal. Erythrocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts from the patient displayed a decrease in cell surface insulin receptors (IRs). The ability of physiologic concentrations of insulin to stimulate metabolic processes was altered in patient fibroblasts. Analysis of the IR gene by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing showed a homozygous missense mutation in exon 3, replacing Cys284 by Tyr in the alpha-subunit. In conclusion, marked primary insulin resistance was evidenced in patient cells as a result of a structural alteration in the IR alpha-subunit. The in vitro studies could not account alone for the in vivo metabolic alterations because glucose homeostasis varied considerably during the day in the patient.
9677346	Expression and function of insulin/insulin-like growth factor I hybrid receptors during differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.	During the assembly of cell surface receptors, insulin proreceptors are sometimes joined to insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor precursors to form covalently linked hybrid receptors. To address the biological consequences of hybrid receptor formation, we studied 3T3-L1 cells known to undergo a 50-70-fold increase in insulin binding while maintaining nearly constant levels of IGF-I binding during differentiation from preadipocytes into adipocytes. The presence of insulin/IGF receptor hybrids in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was demonstrated by the immunoprecipitation of phosphorylated receptors and a novel enzyme-linked immunoassay. Hybrid receptor levels were very low in the early stages of differentiation and increased rapidly between days 4 and 6, reaching a level about 100-fold higher in the mature adipocyte. Coincident with the hybrid assembly, the formation of archetypal (alpha2,beta2) IGF receptors decreased. In fully differentiated adipocytes, virtually all of the IGF receptors were in hybrid form. Stimulation by IGF-I of receptors isolated from mature adipocytes caused autophosphorylation of IGF receptor beta subunits in hybrid complexes, whereas autophosphorylated IGF holoreceptors were not demonstrable. Insulin and IGF-I were equipotent in stimulating glucose uptake in the differentiated adipocytes, leading to the conclusion that hybrid insulin/IGF receptors can transduce a transmembrane signal when activated by IGF-I. We conclude that hybrid formation constitutes a novel post-translational mechanism whereby increased synthesis of insulin receptors limits the cell surface expression of the homologous IGF receptor. Furthermore, biological actions in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, previously attributed to archetypal IGF receptors, are in fact mediated through hybrid receptors.
11606465	Insulin and IGF-1 induce different patterns of gene expression in mouse fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells: identification by cDNA microarray analysis.	The IGF-1 receptor and the related insulin receptor are similar in structure and activate many of the same postreceptor signaling pathways, yet they mediate distinct biological functions. It is still not understood how the specificity of insulin vs. IGF-1 signaling is controlled. In this study, we have used cDNA microarrays to monitor the gene expression patterns that are regulated by insulin and IGF-1. Mouse fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells expressing either the wild-type human IGF receptor or the insulin receptor were stimulated with either IGF-1 or insulin, respectively. Thirty genes, 27 of which were not previously known to be IGF-1 responsive, were up-regulated by IGF-1 but not by insulin. Nine genes, none of which was previously known to be insulin responsive, were up-regulated by insulin but not by IGF-1. The IGF- and insulin-induced regulation of 10 of these genes was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Interestingly, more than half of the genes up-regulated by IGF-1 are associated with mitogenesis and differentiation, whereas none of the genes specifically up-regulated by insulin are associated with these processes. Our results indicate that under the conditions used in this study, IGF-1 is a more potent activator of the mitogenic pathway than insulin in mouse fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells.
12475786	Insulin receptor signaling and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase in beta-cells.	Glucose is the main physiological secretagogue for insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells, and the major biochemical mechanisms involved have been elucidated. In particular, an increase in intracellular calcium is important for insulin exocytosis. More recently, it has become apparent that the beta-cell also has many of the elements of the insulin receptor signal transduction pathway, including the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins 1 and 2. Studies with transgenic models have shown that the beta-cell-selective insulin receptor knockout and the IRS-1 knockout lead to reduced glucose-induced insulin secretion. Overexpression of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 in beta-cells results in increased insulin secretion and increased cytosolic Ca(2+). We have thus postulated the existence of a novel autocrine-positive feedback loop of insulin on its own secretion involving interaction with the insulin receptor signal transduction pathway and regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis. Our current working hypothesis is that this glucose-dependent interaction occurs at the level of IRS-1 and the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase, the calcium pump of the endoplasmic reticulum.
7519016	Positive and negative regulations of albumin gene expression by retinoids in human hepatoma cell lines.	"All-trans-3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2,4,6,10,14-hexadecapentaenoic acid (designated ""acyclic retinoid"") induced upregulation of the albumin gene expression at its transcriptional level, whereas all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) induced downregulation of the expression in both PLC/PRF/5 and HuH7 human hepatoma cell lines. These up- and down regulations of the albumin gene expression coordinated with high and low levels of mRNA for hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 (HNF-1), which is one of the most potent transcription factors for the albumin gene, implying that retinoids may regulate albumin gene expression through HNF-1 expression in opposite ways. The PLC/PRF/5 and HuH7 hepatoma cell lines expressed retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXR alpha) mRNA, whose expression was constitutive. Acyclic retinoid and all-trans-RA both induced upregulation of retinoic acid receptor-beta (RAR beta), and both suppressed cell proliferation-related phenotypic expressions by the alpha-fetoprotein gene and the c-myc oncogene. 9-cis-RA, whose receptor is known to be RXR alpha, also induced upregulation of albumin and HNF-1 expression. These results suggest that acyclic retinoid may act through both RXR alpha and RAR beta, whereas all-trans-RA conveys only RAR beta-mediated functions, at least in these two hepatoma cell lines."
8114938	Point mutations affecting the tyrosine kinase domain of the RET proto-oncogene in Hirschsprung's disease.	Hirschsprung's disease is a genetic disorder of neural crest development affecting 1 in 5,000 births. It is characterized by the absence of intramural ganglion cells in the hindgut, which often results in partial to complete intestinal obstruction during the first years of life. An autosomal dominant gene causing this disease was recently mapped to chromosome 10q11.2 (refs 1,2), using an interstitial deletion of this region isolated in a cell hybrid. It was subsequently localized to a 250-kilobase interval which contains the RET proto-oncogene. Using flanking intronic sequences as primers to amplify 12 of the 20 exons of RET from genomic DNA of 27 Hirschsprung's disease patients, we have now identified four mutations (one frameshift and three missense) that totally disrupt or partially change the structure of the tyrosine kinase domain of the RET protein (Ret). Mutations in the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of Ret have been identified previously in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A, and a targeted mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of the same gene produces intestinal aganglionosis and kidney agenesis in homozygous transgenic mice. Our results support the hypothesis that RET, in addition to its potential role in tumorigenesis, plays a critical role in the embryogenesis of the mammalian enteric nervous system.
9262196	Cellular and developmental patterns of expression of Ret and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha mRNAs.	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has recently been shown to signal by binding to GDNF receptor-alpha (GDNFR-alpha), after which the GDNF-GDNFR-alpha associates with and activates the tyrosine kinase receptor Ret. We have localized Ret messenger RNA (mRNA) in the developing and adult rodent and compared with to the expression of GDNF and GDNFR-alpha mRNA. Ret mRNA is strongly expressed in dopamine neurons and alpha-motor neurons as well as in thalamus, ruber and occluomotor nuclei, the habenular complex, septum, cerebellum, and brain stem nuclei. Ret mRNA was also found in several sensory systems, in ganglia, and in nonneuronal tissues such as teeth and vibrissae. Very strong Ret mRNA signals are present in kidney and the gastrointestinal tract, where Ret and GDNF mRNA expression patterns are precisely complementary. The presence of Ret protein was confirmed in adult dopamine neurons using immunohistochemistry. GDNFR-alpha mRNA was strongly expressed in the developing and adult dopamine neurons. It was also found in neurons in deep layers of cortex cerebri, in hippocampus, septum, the dentate gyrus, tectum, and the developing spinal cord. In the kidney and the gastrointestinal tract, GDNFR-alpha mRNA and Ret mRNA distribution overlapped. Dorsal root ganglia, cranial ganglia, and developing peripheral nerves were also positive. GDNFR-alpha was additionally found in sensory areas and in developing teeth. Sensory areas included inner ear, eye, olfactory epithelium, and the vomeronasal organ, as well as developing tongue papillae. The temporospatial pattern of expression of GDNFR-alpha mRNA did not always match that of Ret mRNA. For instance, GDNFR-alpha mRNA was also found in the developing ventral striatum, including the olfactory tubercle, and in hippocampus. These areas seemed devoid of Ret mRNA, suggesting that GDNFR-alpha might also have functions unrelated to Ret.
9334423	Neurturin and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor-beta (GDNFR-beta), novel proteins related to GDNF and GDNFR-alpha with specific cellular patterns of expression suggesting roles in the developing and adult nervous system and in peripheral organs.	Cloning strategies were used to identify a gene termed glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor-beta (GDNFR-beta) related to GDNFR-alpha. In situ hybridization was then used to map cellular expression of the GDNF-related trophic factor neurturin (NTN) and GDNFR-beta mRNA in developing and adult mice, and comparisons with GDNFR-alpha and RET were made. Neurturin is expressed in postnatal cerebral cortex, striatum, several brainstem areas, and the pineal gland. GDNFR-beta mRNA was more widely expressed in the developing and adult CNS, including cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, zona incerta, hypothalamus, brainstem, and spinal cord, and in subpopulations of sensory neurons and developing peripheral nerves. NTN colocalized with RET and GDNFR-alpha in ureteric buds of the developing kidney. The circular muscle layer of the developing intestines, smooth muscle of the urether, and developing bronchiolae also expressed NTN. GDNFR-beta was found in myenteric but not submucosal intestinal plexuses. In developing salivary glands NTN had an epithelial expression, whereas GDNFR-beta was expressed in surrounding tissue. Neurturin and GDNFR-beta were present in developing sensory organs. In the gonads, NTN appeared to be expressed in Sertoli cells and in the epithelium of the oviduct, whereas GDNFR-beta was expressed by the germ cell line. Our findings suggest multiple roles for NTN and GDNFR-beta in the developing and adult organism. Although NTN and GDNFR-beta expression patterns are sometimes complementary, this is not always the case, suggesting multiple modi operandi of GDNF and NTN in relation to RET and the two binding proteins, GDNFR-alpha and GDNFR-beta.
9506676	Molecular development of the kidney: a review of the results of gene disruption studies.	The kidney has been used for the last 50 years as a model system for the study of tissue inductions and vertebrate organogenesis. While much is known about the morphologic development of the kidney, it is only in the last few years that the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes have begun to be identified. This is largely a result of the identification of genes expressed during kidney development and the application of techniques for single gene disruption. Mammalian kidney development is described, and the methodology for single gene disruption is discussed. For a candidate gene to be unequivocally shown to be involved in organ development, three conditions are necessary. First, the gene must be spatially expressed correctly relative to the developing organ. Second, the gene has to be temporally expressed in a correct manner. Finally, when that gene is disrupted, normal organ development must not occur. There are now 11 genes that satisfy these conditions and thus have been shown to be crucial for metanephric kidney development: WT-1, Pax-2, c-ret, GDNF, alpha8beta1, Wnt-4, BF-2, BMP-7, PDGF B, PDGFRbeta, and alpha3beta1. These genes and their probable roles in kidney development are discussed, and some molecular pathways are suggested. Finally, the applications, limitations, and future trends in single gene disruption studies are discussed. Single gene disruption already has generated a wealth of information about kidney development and mammalian development in general. It is likely that this information is only the beginning, and many startling and profound discoveries can be expected in the years to come both from the utilization of knockout mice that already exist and those that will be created.
9600247	Mutational analysis of the GDNF/RET-GDNFR alpha signaling complex in a kindred with vesicoureteral reflux.	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) mediates signaling across the cell membrane by interaction with the RET-GDNFR alpha receptor complex. We identified a family in which one member had medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and four members had vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Knowledge that mutations in the RET proto-oncogene cause MTC and studies documenting genitourinary abnormalities in RET or GDNF knockout mice led us to examine the GDNF/RET-GDNFR alpha signaling complex in this family. RET and GDNF were excluded as the causative VUR gene by haplotype and sequence analysis. The GDNFR alpha gene was mapped to chromosome 10q25-26 by radiation hybrid techniques and was eliminated as the causative gene by haplotype analysis and sequencing of cDNA from an obligate carrier. Sequencing identified a 15-nucleotide deletion in GDNFR alpha mRNA, which was found to code for a single exon; analysis of several cell types revealed an identical mRNA form, indicating that this variant is a product of alternative RNA processing. We conclude that GDNFR alpha maps to 10q25-26 and that its RNA transcript is alternatively processed. Mutation abnormalities in the GDNF/RET-GDNFR alpha signaling system do not cause VUR in this family.
9690097	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor stimulates ureteric bud outgrowth and enhances survival of ureteric bud cells in vitro.	Development of epithelial organs requires co-ordinated interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal tissues. Studies using null mutant mice have indicated that the ret receptor and its ligand, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), are crucial for initiation of development of the metanephric kidney. However, the role of this signalling system in other branching organs has not been analysed. Here we describe expression studies of ret, GDNF, and a co-receptor for GDNF (GDNFR alpha) in the developing mouse metanephros, lung, and submandibular salivary gland. Also, we examined the role of this signalling system in the development of these organs in vitro. In situ hybridisation revealed differences in the spatial distribution of the three transcripts in the different organs. At the initiation of metanephric development, late on embryonic day 10 (E10), ret and GDNFR alpha were detected in the Wolffian duct (including the presumptive ureteric bud) whilst the presumptive metanephric, mesenchyme expressed GDNFR alpha and GDNF. Later in development, all three transcripts were restricted to the nephrogenic zone. In contrast, expression in the lung was not detectable by in situ hybridisation until after initiation of development, at E13.5. At this time ret was expressed throughout the epithelium; GDNF was detected throughout the mesenchyme, and GDNFR alpha was present in the proximal epithelium and mesenchyme only. Ret and GDNF were not detected in the epithelium or mesenchyme of the developing salivary gland, however, GDNFR alpha was expressed in the mesenchyme at E13.5 and E16.5. Functional studies demonstrated that in organ culture, GDNF significantly increased branching morphogenesis of the E11.5 metanephros, and induced the formation of ectopic ureteric buds from the base of the bud and from the Wolffian duct. The development of lung and salivary primordia were not affected under similar growth conditions. In a novel ureteric bud primary culture system, GDNF significantly increased cell numbers at 24 and 48 h. In cells cultured on laminin this increase was due to increased survival and proliferation, whereas in cells cultured on fibronectin, only survival was enhanced. Our data suggest that GDNF stimulates outgrowth of the ureteric bud, in part, by enhancing cell survival and possibly by increasing proliferation.
10204848	Investigation of germline GFR alpha-1 mutations in Hirschsprung disease.	Inactivating mutations of the RET proto-oncogene and of one of its soluble ligand molecules, glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), have been found in a subset of patients with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). However, the majority of HSCR mutations remain unidentified. As normal RET function requires a multicomponent ligand complex for activation, other members of the RET ligand complex are primary candidates for these mutations. We investigated the presence of mutations in another member of the RET signalling complex, GDNF family receptor alpha-1 (GFR alpha-1), in a panel of 269 independent cases of HSCR. We identified 10 polymorphisms at the GFR alpha-1 locus. Surprisingly, however, we did not identify any sequence variants in our HSCR population that were not also present in a normal control population. Our data suggest that mutations of the GFR alpha-1 gene are not a common aetiological event in HSCR.
10331988	Signalling by the RET receptor tyrosine kinase and its role in the development of the mammalian enteric nervous system.	RET is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) superfamily, which can transduce signalling by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NTN) in cultured cells. In order to determine whether in addition to being sufficient, RET is also necessary for signalling by these growth factors, we studied the response to GDNF and NTN of primary neuronal cultures (peripheral sensory and central dopaminergic neurons) derived from wild-type and RET-deficient mice. Our experiments show that absence of a functional RET receptor abrogates the biological responses of neuronal cells to both GDNF and NTN. Despite the established role of the RET signal transduction pathway in the development of the mammalian enteric nervous system (ENS), very little is known regarding its cellular mechanism(s) of action. Here, we have studied the effects of GDNF and NTN on cultures of neural crest (NC)-derived cells isolated from the gut of rat embryos. Our findings suggest that GDNF and NTN promote the survival of enteric neurons as well as the survival, proliferation and differentiation of multipotential ENS progenitors present in the gut of E12.5-13.5 rat embryos. However, the effects of these growth factors are stage-specific, since similar ENS cultures established from later stage embryos (E14. 5-15.5), show markedly diminished response to GDNF and NTN. To examine whether the in vitro effects of RET activation reflect the in vivo function(s) of this receptor, the extent of programmed cell death was examined in the gut of wild-type and RET-deficient mouse embryos by TUNEL histochemistry. Our experiments show that a subpopulation of enteric NC undergoes apoptotic cell death specifically in the foregut of embryos lacking the RET receptor. We suggest that normal function of the RET RTK is required in vivo during early stages of ENS histogenesis for the survival of undifferentiated enteric NC and their derivatives.
10471511	Eya1-deficient mice lack ears and kidneys and show abnormal apoptosis of organ primordia.	Haploinsufficiency for human EYA1, a homologue of the Drosophila melanogaster gene eyes absent (eya), results in the dominantly inherited disorders branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome and branchio-oto (BO) syndrome, which are characterized by craniofacial abnormalities and hearing loss with (BOR) or without (BO) kidney defects. To understand the developmental pathogenesis of organs affected in these syndromes, we inactivated the gene Eya1 in mice. Eya1 heterozygotes show renal abnormalities and a conductive hearing loss similar to BOR syndrome, whereas Eya1 homozygotes lack ears and kidneys due to defective inductive tissue interactions and apoptotic regression of the organ primordia. Inner ear development in Eya1 homozygotes arrests at the otic vesicle stage and all components of the inner ear and specific cranial sensory ganglia fail to form. In the kidney, Eya1 homozygosity results in an absence of ureteric bud outgrowth and a subsequent failure of metanephric induction. Gdnf expression, which is required to direct ureteric bud outgrowth via activation of the c-ret Rtk (refs 5, 6, 7, 8), is not detected in Eya1-/- metanephric mesenchyme. In Eya1-/- ear and kidney development, Six but not Pax expression is Eya1 dependent, similar to a genetic pathway elucidated in the Drosophila eye imaginal disc. Our results indicate that Eya1 controls critical early inductive signalling events involved in ear and kidney formation and integrate Eya1 into the genetic regulatory cascade controlling kidney formation upstream of Gdnf. In addition, our results suggest that an evolutionarily conserved Pax-Eya-Six regulatory hierarchy is used in mammalian ear and kidney development.
10535317	GDNF and its receptors in the regulation of the ureteric branching.	Recent transgenic and organ culture experiments have inevitably shown that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a mesenchyme-derived signal for ureteric budding and branching. The signalling receptor complex for GDNF includes a dimer of Ret receptor tyrosine kinase and two molecules of GDNF family receptor alpha1. Alpha-receptors are not only needed for the ligand binding and Ret activation, but they might mediate signals without Ret. While GDNF is clearly required for ureteric branching, tissue recombination studies have shown that it is not sufficient for the completion of ureteric morphogenesis, and other signalling molecules are needed. Different experimental models have resulted in somewhat contradictory results on their molecular identity, but transforming growth factor-beta1, -beta2, fibroblast growth factor-7 and hepatocyte growth factor form, obviously among others, a redundant set of growth factors in ureteric differentiation. Three other members of the GDNF family, neurturin, artemin and persephin, are also expressed in the developing kidney, and at least neurturin and persephin promote ureteric branching in vitro, but their true in vivo roles are still unclear.
10850426	RET receptor expression in thyroid follicular epithelial cell-derived tumors.	The RET proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase for transforming growth factor-beta-related neurotrophic factors, which include GDNF and neurturin. The expression of RET proto-oncogene was detected in several tissues, such as spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, salivary gland, and spinal cord, and in several neural crest-derived cell lines. RET expression in the thyroid gland was reported to be restricted to neural crest-derived C cells. The presence of RET mRNA or protein has not yet been reported in thyroid follicular cells. We previously demonstrated the expression of oncogenic rearranged versions of RET in papillary thyroid carcinomas: tumors derived from thyroid follicular cells. To assess the expression of the normal RET proto-oncogene in follicular cells, we analyzed its expression in a panel of neoplasias originating from thyroid follicular epithelial cells: papillary carcinomas and both follicular adenomas and carcinomas. We also demonstrated the presence of RET normal transcripts in two follicular thyroid carcinoma lymph node metastases. Moreover, we found the presence of the RET/ELE1 transcript, the reciprocal complementary form of the oncogenic fusion transcript ELE1/RET, in a papillary thyroid carcinoma specimen expressing the RET/PTC3 oncogene, thus demonstrating that the RET promoter is active in those cells after rearrangement. Finally, we show that in a papillary carcinoma-derived cell line expressing the proto-RET receptor and the related GFRalpha2 co-receptor, GDNF treatment induced RET tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent signal transduction pathway, indicating that RET could be active in thyroid follicular cells.
11001832	Kidney development: regulatory molecules crucial to both mice and men.	Although the study of embryonic kidney development began in the 1950s, three decades passed until scientists began identifying the molecular controls of renal organogenesis. Most of these advances have come from mouse gene targeting and rodent kidney explant manipulation. Translation of the rodent data to human congenital kidney disease has only just begun. The activities of those regulatory molecules proven to be used in common appear remarkably similar in mouse and human renal development. Examples of these genes include glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), RET, PAX2, Wilms tumor suppressor (WT1), and components in the renin-angiotensin pathway. Other factors that participate in mouse renal organogenesis, such as N-Myc, may later be proven important in human kidney development.
11138002	Vitamin A controls epithelial/mesenchymal interactions through Ret expression.	Mutations or rearrangements in the gene encoding the receptor tyrosine kinase RET result in Hirschsprung disease, cancer and renal malformations. The standard model of renal development involves reciprocal signaling between the ureteric bud epithelium, inducing metanephric mesenchyme to differentiate into nephrons, and metanephric mesenchyme, inducing the ureteric bud to grow and branch. RET and GDNF (a RET ligand) are essential mediators of these epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Vitamin A deficiency has been associated with widespread embryonic abnormalities, including renal malformations. The vitamin A signal is transduced by nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs). We previously showed that two RAR genes, Rara and Rarb2, were colocalized in stromal mesenchyme, a third renal cell type, where their deletion led to altered stromal cell patterning, impaired ureteric bud growth and downregulation of Ret in the ureteric bud. Here we demonstrate that forced expression of Ret in mice deficient for both Rara and Rarb2 (Rara(-/-)Rarb2(-/-)) genetically rescues renal development, restoring ureteric bud growth and stromal cell patterning. Our studies indicate the presence of a new reciprocal signaling loop between the ureteric bud epithelium and the stromal mesenchyme, dependent on Ret and vitamin A. In the first part of the loop, vitamin-A-dependent signals secreted by stromal cells control Ret expression in the ureteric bud. In the second part of the loop, ureteric bud signals dependent on Ret control stromal cell patterning.
11798749	[The expression of glial cell derived neurotrophic factor and its receptor GDNFR-alpha and GDNFR-beta mRNA in spinal cord, brainstem and frontal cortex during morphine withdrawal in rats].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its receptor GDNFR-alpha (GFRalpha-1) and GDNFR-beta (Ret) genes and the effects of muscarinic receptor antagonists, NMDA receptor antagonist, inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase on the expression of these genes in the spinal cord, brainstem and frontal cortex during morphine withdrawal, and to observe the effects of GDNF antisense oligoneucleotide (i.c.v) on the morphine withdrawal symptoms in rats. METHODS: The levels of GDNF, GDNFR-alpha and GDNFR-beta mRNA were assayed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with the beta-actin mRNA as an internal control. RESULTS: The GDNF mRNA levels were increased, and GDNFR-alpha and GDNFR-beta mRNA levels was slightly increased in the spinal cord and brainstem during morphine dependence. These genes were decreased at 1 h, increased at 2 h after administration of naloxone in morphine dependent rats. While the GDNF, GDNFR-alpha and GDNFR-beta levels in the frontal cortex were increased significantly at 1, 2 and 4 h after the injection of naloxone during morphine withdrawal. The pre-treatment with L-N-nitric arginine methylester (10 mg/kg), the expressions of GDNF and GDNFR-beta in the spinal cord, both GDNFR-alpha and GDNFR-beta in the frontal cortex were decreased. The expressions of both GDNF and GDNFR-alpha in the frontal cortex were decreased by treatment with MK801 (0.5 mg/kg), and the expressions of GDNF in both the stem and cortex, and GDNFR-beta in the brainstem decreased by treatment with the methyl-scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg). The beta-actin mRNA levels were not different in each group. Moreover, the morphine withdrawal symptoms were attenuated by intracerebroven tricular injection of GDNF antisense oligoneucleotide in 6 hour and 24 hour before naloxone administration in morphine dependent rats. CONCLUSION: The results not only provide direct evidence that the expressions of GDNF and its receptors mRNA in glial cells play an important role in mediating the process of morphine dependence and may be account for the long-term neuro-adaptation associated with morphine dependence, but also suggest that muscarinic receptor, NMDA receptor and nitric oxide pathways may be involved in the expression of GDNF and GDNF receptor genes during morphine withdrawal.
11846482	Ureteric bud outgrowth in response to RET activation is mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.	The c-ret gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase (RET) essential for the development of the kidney and enteric nervous system. Activation of RET requires the secreted neurotrophin GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor) and its high affinity receptor, a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-linked cell surface protein GFRalpha1. In the developing kidney, RET, GDNF, and GFRalpha1 are all required for directed outgrowth and branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud epithelium. Using MDCK renal epithelial cells as a model system, activation of RET induces cell migration, scattering, and formation of filopodia and lamellipodia. RET-expressing MDCK cells are able to migrate toward a localized source of GDNF. In this report, the intracellular signaling mechanisms regulating RET-dependent migration and chemotaxis are examined. Activation of RET resulted in increased levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity and Akt/PKB phosphorylation. This increase in PI3K activity is essential for regulating the GDNF response, since the specific inhibitor, LY294002, blocks migration and chemotaxis of MDCK cells. Using an in vitro organ culture assay, inhibition of PI3K completely blocks the GDNF-dependent outgrowth of ectopic ureter buds. PI3K is also essential for branching morphogenesis once the ureteric bud has invaded the kidney mesenchyme. The data suggest that activation of RET in the ureteric bud epithelium signals through PI3K to control outgrowth and branching morphogenesis.
12783789	Wnt11 and Ret/Gdnf pathways cooperate in regulating ureteric branching during metanephric kidney development.	Reciprocal cell-cell interactions between the ureteric epithelium and the metanephric mesenchyme are needed to drive growth and differentiation of the embryonic kidney to completion. Branching morphogenesis of the Wolffian duct derived ureteric bud is integral in the generation of ureteric tips and the elaboration of the collecting duct system. Wnt11, a member of the Wnt superfamily of secreted glycoproteins, which have important regulatory functions during vertebrate embryonic development, is specifically expressed in the tips of the branching ureteric epithelium. In this work, we explore the role of Wnt11 in ureteric branching and use a targeted mutation of the Wnt11 locus as an entrance point into investigating the genetic control of collecting duct morphogenesis. Mutation of the Wnt11 gene results in ureteric branching morphogenesis defects and consequent kidney hypoplasia in newborn mice. Wnt11 functions, in part, by maintaining normal expression levels of the gene encoding glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf). Gdnf encodes a mesenchymally produced ligand for the Ret tyrosine kinase receptor that is crucial for normal ureteric branching. Conversely, Wnt11 expression is reduced in the absence of Ret/Gdnf signaling. Consistent with the idea that reciprocal interaction between Wnt11 and Ret/Gdnf regulates the branching process, Wnt11 and Ret mutations synergistically interact in ureteric branching morphogenesis. Based on these observations, we conclude that Wnt11 and Ret/Gdnf cooperate in a positive autoregulatory feedback loop to coordinate ureteric branching by maintaining an appropriate balance of Wnt11-expressing ureteric epithelium and Gdnf-expressing mesenchyme to ensure continued metanephric development.
12914961	Mitogenic effect of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor is dependent on the activation of p70S6 kinase, but independent of the activation of ERK and up-regulation of Ret in SH-SY5Y cells.	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) activates c-Ret tyrosine kinase and several downstream intracellular pathways; the biological effects caused by the activation of each of these pathways, however, remain to be elucidated. Here we report the ability of GDNF to induce proliferation, rather than differentiation, of neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) by targeting the signaling pathway responsible for mediating this proliferative effect. GDNF induces the phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) in SH-SY5Y cells in which Ret protein expression is relatively low. Interestingly, treating SH-SY5Y cells with retinoic acid greatly increases Ret protein levels and GDNF-induced Ret tyrosine phosphorylation, but does not affect the mitogenic action of GDNF and the activation of the Akt/p70S6K pathway. In contrast, the activation of the ERK pathway and the resulting induction of immediate-early genes parallel the increases in Ret protein levels. Rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of p70S6K activation by the mammalian target of rapamycin, completely prevents GDNF-induced proliferation and activation of p70S6K. These results suggest that GDNF promotes cell proliferation via the activation of p70S6K, independent of the ERK signaling pathway, and that GDNF activates the Akt/p70S6K pathway more efficiently than the ERK pathway in the cells in which Ret expression is low.
8306871	Expression of the c-ret proto-oncogene during mouse embryogenesis.	The c-ret proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase whose normal function has yet to be determined. To begin to investigate the potential role of this gene in vertebrate development, we have isolated cDNA clones representing the murine c-ret gene, and have analyzed the pattern of expression during mouse embryogenesis, using northern blotting, in situ hybridization to histological sections and whole-mount hybridization histochemistry. c-ret transcripts were detected beginning at day 8.5 of embryogenesis, and were observed in a number of cell lineages in the developing peripheral and central nervous systems, as well as in the excretory system. In the cranial region at day 8.5-9.5, c-ret mRNA was restricted to a population of neural crest cells migrating from rhombomere 4 and forming the anlage of the facioacoustic ganglion, as well as to a closely associated domain of surface ectoderm and pharyngeal endoderm. At later stages (10.5-14.5 days), c-ret mRNA was observed in all cranial ganglia. In the peripheral nervous system of the trunk, c-ret was expressed in the autonomic ganglia and in subsets of cells in the dorsal root ganglia. In the enteric nervous system, c-ret was expressed in the presumptive enteric neuroblasts of the vagal crest (day 9.0-11.5), and in the myenteric ganglia of the gut (day 13.5-14.5). c-ret mRNA was observed in several regions of the central nervous system, including the undifferentiated neuroepithelial cells of the ventral neural tube (8.5 days), the motor neurons in the spinal cord and the hindbrain (10.5-14.5 days), the embryonic neuroretina (day 13.5) and the layers of the postnatal retina containing ganglion, amacrine and horizontal cells. Outside the nervous system, c-ret was expressed in the nephric (Wolffian) duct at day 8.5-10.5, the ureteric bud epithelium (but not the surrounding metanephric mesenchyme) at day 11.0-11.5, and the growing tips of the renal collecting ducts (but not the previously formed, subcortical portions of the collecting ducts, or the mesenchyme-derived renal vesicles) at day 13.5-17.5. Our results suggest that the c-ret gene may encode the receptor for a factor involved in the proliferation, migration, differentiation or survival of a variety of neuronal cell lineages, as well as in inductive interactions during organogenesis of the kidney.
8306895	Differential expression of neurotrophin receptors during renal development.	Early kidney differentiation is driven by local cell-cell interactions. The metanephrogenic mesenchyme stimulates the epithelial ureter bud to grow and branch, whereas the ureter bud stimulates the mesenchyme to convert into a new epithelium. These interactions may be dependent on local growth factors and their receptors. We studied the expression of receptors for nerve growth factors during kidney development. Expression of the low- and high-affinity receptors was cell-type specific. The low-affinity NGF receptor was found in the uninduced mesenchyme at early developmental stages, but in the glomerular podocytes at later developmental stages. In contrast, the high-affinity trkB receptor was found in the cortical mesenchyme cells that will differentiate into stroma. The trkC receptor was found only weakly expressed and in a few parts of the collecting ducts. The role of these receptors and c-ros, a receptor-type kinase expressed on the tip of the ureter bud, was studied by modified antisense oligonucleotides. However, we found that both sense, antisense and nonsense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides inhibited mouse and rat embryonic kidney development in vitro. The oligonucleotides appeared to be toxic for rodent embryonic kidneys in the experimental conditions that we used. Moreover, oligonucleotides did not penetrate well into the epithelial sheets in the organ cultures. We conclude that studies with phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides in organ cultures of embryonic kidneys should be interpreted with caution. Our current data do not allow us to not assign a function for the low- or high-affinity NGF receptors or c-ros in kidney development.
8768751	A comparison of the effects of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor on spinal cord and cortex cerebri grafts.	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has trophic effects on developing dopamine neurons, enhances survival of embryonic motoneurons in vitro and prevents axotomy-induced motoneuron atrophy in vivo. Here we investigate effects of GDNF on grafts of cortex cerebri tissue from E18, P1 and P8 donors and on spinal cord tissue for P8 and adult animals transplanted to the anterior chamber of the eye of host rats. Grafts were treated with GDNF or cytochrome C on days 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 (total amounts 0.5 microgram GDNF/eye/injection). Spinal cord grafts from P8 donors treated with GDNF grew to sizes larger than controls, had higher numbers of neuron-like cells and showed increased areas of neurofilament immunoreactivity and decreased glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity. In contrast to the P8 spinal cord grafts, there were no such effects observed in adult spinal cord grafts or in E18, P1 or P8 cerebral cortex grafts. To determine if an endogenous source of GDNF might exert similar effects on spinal cord grafts, we transplanted spinal cord tissue from P1 together with pieces of developing kidney, known to express high levels of GDNF mRNA. Spinal cord cografted with kidney tissue grew to a slightly larger extent then controls. We conclude that GDNF exerts a powerful trophic effect on P8 spinal cord grafts, although GDNF appears unable to support survival of grafted adult spinal cord tissue. Grafts of cortex cerebri from several different stages of development were not affected.
8827072	Gene targeting in kidney development.	Cancer and development are conceptually related because tumor formation in many cases results from the aberrant expression of a developmental program. This is certainly true of Wilms' tumors, which display a range of phenotypes resembling various stages of kidney development. WT1 has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene involved in a subset of Wilms' tumors. Gene targeting of the WT1 gene demonstrated the requirement for this gene product during early urogenital development. Several other genes, including Wnt-4, c-ret, ld and lim 1, have been shown by gene targeting to also be involved in early kidney development. This review discusses gene targeting as an approach to the study of development and reviews the phenotypes of these and other genes involved in kidney organogenesis.
8855235	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor activates the receptor tyrosine kinase RET and promotes kidney morphogenesis.	The receptor tyrosine kinase RET functions during the development of the kidney and the enteric nervous system, yet no ligand has been identified to date. This report demonstrates that the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) activates RET, as measured by tyrosine phosphorylation of the intracellular catalytic domain. GDNF also binds RET with a dissociation constant of 8 nM, and 125I-labeled GDNF can be coimmunoprecipitated with anti-RET antibodies. In addition, exogenous GDNF stimulates both branching and proliferation of embryonic kidneys in organ culture, whereas neutralizing antibodies against GDNF inhibit branching morphogenesis. These data indicate that RET and GDNF are components of a common signaling pathway and point to a role for GDNF in kidney development.
10198418	Expression of c-ret promotes morphogenesis and cell survival in mIMCD-3 cells.	c-Ret, a protein tyrosine kinase receptor, and its ligand glial-derived neurotropic factor (GDNF) are critical for early regulation of ureteric bud development and nephrogenesis. To address whether c-ret directly initiates epithelial cell morphogenesis, the c-ret receptor was expressed in murine inner medullary collecting duct cells (mIMCD-3, a cell line of ureteric bud origin, which has no detectable endogenous c-ret expression). Stable expression of wild-type c-ret was found to yield a constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor, with no change after the addition of GDNF. Examination of mRNA from these cells demonstrated the message for endogenous GDNF, suggesting that c-ret was potentially being constitutively activated by an autocrine mechanism. When mIMCD-3 cells stably expressing the phosphorylated c-ret receptor were cultured in a type I collagen matrix, they exhibited little GDNF-independent or -dependent branching process formation at early time points compared with the known morphogen hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (48 h; control, 0.33 +/- 0.33; GDNF, 1.0 +/- 0.58, P = nonsignificant; and HGF, 6.33 +/- 0.33 processes/20 cell clusters, P < 0.001), whereas extended culture (7 days) under serum-free conditions revealed a marked increase in cell survival and the spontaneous development of rudimentary branching process formation. Extended culture (7 days) of c-ret-expressing clones in type I collagen with the epithelial morphogens HGF and/or epidermal growth factor (EGF) resulted in the development of complex three-dimensional spiny cysts, whereas parental mIMCD-3 cells died under these conditions. We conclude that activated c-ret appears to mediate epithelial morphogenesis by prolonging cell survival and, in conjunction with activation of the morphogenic receptors c-met and the EGF receptor, initiates the events required for very early branching morphogenesis.
10415156	Expression of neurturin, GDNF, and GDNF family-receptor mRNA in the developing and mature mouse.	The GDNF family of neurotrophic factors currently has four members: neurturin (NRTN), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), persephin, and artemin. These proteins are potent survival factors for several populations of central and peripheral neurons. The receptors for these factors are complexes that include the Ret tyrosine kinase receptor and a GPI-linked, ligand-binding component called GDNF family receptor alpha 1-4 (GFRalpha1-4). We have used in situ hybridization to study the mRNA expression of NRTN, GDNF, Ret, GFRalpha1, and GFRalpha2 during embryonic development and in the adult mouse. GDNF receptors were prominently expressed during embryonic development in the nervous system, the urogenital system, the digestive system, the respiratory system, and in developing skin, bone, muscle, and endocrine glands. In some regions, incomplete receptor complexes were expressed suggesting that other, as yet unidentified, receptor components exist or that receptor complexes are formed in trans. NRTN and GDNF were expressed in many trigeminal targets during embryonic development including the nasal epithelium, the teeth, and the whisker follicles. NRTN and GDNF were also expressed in the developing limbs and urogenital system. In the embryo, GDNF factors and receptors were expressed at several sites of mesenchyme/epithelial induction, including the kidney, tooth, and submandibular gland. This expression pattern is consistent with the possibility that the GDNF factors function in inductive processes during embryonic development and with the recently discovered role of NRTN as a necessary trophic factor for the development of some parasympathetic neurons. In the mature animal, receptor expression was more limited than in the embryo. In the adult mouse, NRTN was most prominently expressed in the gut, prostate testicle, and oviduct; GDNF was most prominently expressed in the ovary.
10822229	Expression of RET and its ligand complexes, GDNF/GFRalpha-1 and NTN/GFRalpha-2, in medullary thyroid carcinomas.	OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the RET proto-oncogene are found in about one third of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTCs), mostly affecting codon 918. Glial cell line derived neurotropic factor (GDNF) and its membrane-bound GDNF family receptor alpha (GFRalpha-1), as well as neurturin (NTN) and its membrane-bound receptor GFRalpha-2 form a complex with the RET product, a receptor tyrosine kinase, resulting in downstream signaling to the nucleus. DESIGN: To elucidate the role of these RET ligands in MTC tumorigenesis, their expression was determined in 15 MTC samples, one papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and three normal thyroid tissue specimens. METHODS: The mRNA expression of RET, GDNF, GFRalpha-1, NTN and GFRalpha-2 was investigated by mRNA in situ hybridization, and confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR analysis. RESULTS: None of the five genes was expressed in the normal thyroids or in the PTC. All MTCs showed expression of RET, 13 expressed GDNF, 12 expressed GFRalpha-1 and 9 expressed NTN and GFRalpha-2. In 7 of the tumors RET, GDNF and GFRalpha-1 were expressed at high levels, and in five of these seven tumors NTN and GFRalpha-2 genes were also expressed at high levels. The high level of expression was preferentially seen in tumor cells adjacent to stroma and connective tissue. All MTCs without expression of the RET ligands harbored the RET codon 918 mutation. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that this signaling pathway is important for MTC development, and that it may be activated by expression of the RET ligand complexes by the tumor cells themselves.
10980433	Cross-talk in kidney development.	As in most organs, the emerging theme in kidney development is the importance of cross-talk between several tissues and cell lineages to allow morphogenesis to proceed in a complex but highly regulated way. Over the past few years, knock-out and transgenic analyses in mice and evolutionary comparison with non-mammalian species have been particularly instrumental in identifying molecules with crucial functions for tissue-tissue interactions. The transcription factors Wt1 and Eya1, the signalling molecules Gdnf and LIF and the receptors c-Ret and GdnfRalpha have been demonstrated to fulfil fundamental roles in the first step of metanephric induction, the outgrowth of the ureter. Signalling by members of the Wnt, BMP and FGF families, regulated by transcription factors such as Pax2, mediates nephrogenesis by adjusting the balance between the ureteric bud epithelium, stromal and nephrogenic tissues. The stromal tissue, neglected for many years, has been shown to serve important functions in regulating the growth of nephrons. Finally, we have also begun to gain insight into the molecular events underlying patterning of the nephron into distinct functional units including glomerulus, proximal and distal tubule.
11087631	GDNF and GFRalpha-1 are components of the axolotl pronephric duct guidance system.	In mammals, secretion of GDNF by the metanephrogenic mesenchyme is essential for branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud and, thus, metanephric development. However, the expression pattern of GDNF and its receptor complex-the GPI-linked ligand-binding protein, GFRalpha-1, and the Ret tyrosine kinase signaling protein-indicates that it could operate at early steps in kidney development as well. Furthermore, the developing nephric systems of fish and amphibian embryos express components of the GDNF signaling system even though they do not make a metanephros. We provide evidence that GDNF signaling through GFRalpha-1 is sufficient to direct pathfinding of migrating pronephric duct cells in axolotl embryos by: (1) demonstrating that application of soluble GFRalpha-1 to an embryo lacking all GPI-linked proteins rescues PND migration in a dose-dependent fashion, (2) showing that application of excess soluble GFRalpha-1 to a normal embryo inhibits migration and that inhibition is dependent upon GDNF-binding activity, and (3) showing that the PND will migrate toward a GDNF-soaked bead in vivo, but will fail to migrate when GDNF is applied uniformly to the flank. These data suggest that PND pathfinding is accomplished by migration up a gradient of GDNF.
11106404	GDNF - a stranger in the TGF-beta superfamily?	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family, consisting of GDNF, neurturin, artemin and persephin are distant members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. Unlike other members of the TGF-beta superfamily, which signal through the receptor serine-threonine kinases, GDNF family ligands activate intracellular signalling cascades via the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret. GDNF family ligands first bind to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored GDNF family receptor alpha (GFRalpha) and then the GDNF family ligand-GFRalpha complex binds to and stimulates autophosphorylation of Ret. Alternatively, a preassociated complex between GFRalpha and Ret could form the binding site for the GDNF family ligand. GFRalpha1, GFRalpha2, GFRalpha3 and GFRalpha4 are the physiological coreceptors for GDNF, neurturin, artemin and persephin, respectively. Although all GDNF family ligands signal via activated Ret, GDNF can signal also via GFRalpha1 in the absence of Ret. GPI-anchored GFRalpha receptors are localized in plasma membrane to lipid rafts. GDNF binding to GFRalpha1 also recruits Ret to the lipid rafts and triggers association with Src, which is required for effective downstream signalling, leading to differentiation and neuronal survival. GDNF family ligands are potent survival factors for midbrain dopamine neurons, motoneurons, noradrenergic neurons, as well as for sympathetic, parasympathetic and sensory neurons. However, for most neuronal populations, except for motoneurons, TGF-beta is required as a cofactor for GDNF family ligand signalling. Because GDNF and neurturin can rescue dopamine neurons in the animal models of Parkinson disease, as well as motoneurons in vivo, hopes have been raised that GDNF family ligands may be new drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. GDNF also has distinct functions outside the nervous system, promoting ureteric branching in kidney development and regulating spermatogenesis.
11222636	c-Src is required for glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligand-mediated neuronal survival via a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K)-dependent pathway.	The glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFLs), consisting of GDNF, neurturin, persephin, and artemin, signal via a multicomponent complex composed of Ret tyrosine kinase and the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored coreceptors GFRalpha1-alpha4. In previous work we have demonstrated that the localization of Ret to membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts is essential for GDNF-induced downstream signaling, differentiation, and neuronal survival. Moreover, we have found that Ret interacts with members of the Src family kinases (SFK) only when it is localized to these microdomains. In the present work we show by pharmacological and genetic approaches that Src activity was necessary to elicit optimal GDNF-mediated signaling, neurite outgrowth, and survival. In particular, p60Src, but not the other ubiquitous SFKs, Fyn and Yes, was responsible for the observed effects. Moreover, Src appeared to promote neuronal survival via a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K)-dependent pathway because the PI-3K inhibitor LY294002 prevented GFL-mediated neuronal survival and prevented activated Src-mediated neuronal survival. In contrast, the inhibition of Src activity had no effects on NGF-mediated survival, indicating that the requirement for Src was selective for GFL-mediated neuronal survival. These data confirm the importance of protein-protein interactions between Ret and raft-associated proteins in the signaling pathways elicited by GDNF, and the data implicate Src as one of the major signaling molecules involved in GDNF-mediated bioactivity.
11302967	Analysis of the RET, GDNF, EDN3, and EDNRB genes in patients with intestinal neuronal dysplasia and Hirschsprung disease.	BACKGROUND: Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a frequent congenital disorder with an incidence of 1 in 5000 live births, characterised by the absence of parasympathetic intramural ganglion cells in the hindgut resulting in intestinal obstruction in neonates and severe constipation in infants and adults. Intestinal neuronal dysplasia (IND) shares clinical features with HSCR but the submucosal parasympathetic plexus is affected. IND has been proposed as one of the most frequent causes of chronic constipation and is often associated with HSCR. METHODS: We examined 29 patients diagnosed with sporadic HSCR, 20 patients with IND, and 12 patients with mixed HSCR/IND for mutations in the coding regions of the RET, GDNF, EDNRB, and EDN3 genes. The entire coding regions were analysed by single strand conformational polymorphism and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Only three RET mutations were detected in patients with HSCR. In patients with IND or a mixed HSCR/IND phenotype, no mutations in these genes were observed. While HSCR and HSCR/IND showed over representation of a specific RET polymorphism in exon 2, IND exhibited a significantly lower frequency comparable with that of controls. CONCLUSIONS: The mutation frequency found in our sporadic HSCR patients (10%) and the allelic distribution of RET polymorphisms are comparable with earlier published data. A significantly different allelic distribution in an established HSCR associated polymorphism argues against common genetic pathways for HSCR and IND.
11746356	Evidence for a ligand-specific signaling through GFRalpha-1, but not GFRalpha-2, in the absence of Ret.	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NTN) are two homologeous proteins that have been recognized as potent survival factors for distinct neuronal populations. GDNF and NTN act through a two-component receptor system consisting of the ligand-specific binding subunits GDNF family receptor (GFR)alpha-1 and GFRalpha-2 and the common transducing subunit c-Ret. In addition, it has been demonstrated that GDNF can signal through GFRalpha-1 in the absence of c-Ret. In the present study, we sought to determine whether a similar c-Ret-independent signaling applies for GFRalpha-2. In addition, we have characterized the ligand specificity of the c-Ret-independent action of GFRalphas. To establish an assay system for these studies, several neural cell lines were screened for the presence of GDNF and NTN receptor subunits by RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis. c-Ret expression was detectable only in Neuro2A cells, which did not express GFRalpha-1 or GFRalpha-2. The neuronal cell line LS expressed GFRalpha-2, and the glial cell line Mes42 expressed GFRalpha-1, whereas the neuronal cell line B104 expressed both GFRalpha-1 and GFRalpha-2. Stimulation of B104 and Mes42 cells with GDNF, but not with NTN, for 10 min resulted in CREB phosphorylation. In apparent contrast, neither NTN nor GDNF promoted CREB activation in LS and Neuro2A cells. Moreover, exposure of LS cells to NTN or GDNF also failed to activate AKT and ERK. Together these findings provide evidence that, in contrast to GFRalpha-1, GFRalpha-2 fails to signal in the absence of c-Ret. In addition, these observations reveal that c-Ret-independent signaling of GFRalpha-1 is ligand- specific and occurs only with GDNF.
12682085	GDNF promotes tubulogenesis of GFRalpha1-expressing MDCK cells by Src-mediated phosphorylation of Met receptor tyrosine kinase.	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) are multifunctional signaling molecules in embryogenesis. HGF binds to and activates Met receptor tyrosine kinase. The signaling receptor complex for GDNF typically includes both GDNF family receptor alpha1 (GFRalpha1) and Ret receptor tyrosine kinase. GDNF can also signal independently of Ret via GFRalpha1, although the mechanism has remained unclear. We now show that GDNF partially restores ureteric branching morphogenesis in ret-deficient mice with severe renal hypodysplasia. The mechanism of Ret-independent effect of GDNF was therefore studied by the MDCK cell model. In MDCK cells expressing GFRalpha1 but no Ret, GDNF stimulates branching but not chemotactic migration, whereas both branching and chemotaxis are promoted by GDNF in the cells coexpressing Ret and GFRalpha1, mimicking HGF/Met responses in wild-type MDCK cells. Indeed, GDNF induces Met phosphorylation in several ret-deficient/GFRalpha1-positive and GFRalpha1/Ret-coexpressing cell lines. However, GDNF does not immunoprecipite Met, making a direct interaction between GDNF and Met highly improbable. Met activation is mediated by Src family kinases. The GDNF-induced branching of MDCK cells requires Src activation, whereas the HGF-induced branching does not. Our data show a mechanism for the GDNF-induced branching morphogenesis in non-Ret signaling.
12813408	Cells of the human optic nerve head express glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and the GDNF receptor complex.	PURPOSE: Glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a distant member of the TGFbeta family of growth factors and has wide ranging effects within the central nervous system. In the present study we profile the expression of GDNF and its receptor complex (Ret and GFRalpha-1) in cells isolated from the human optic nerve head (ONH). METHODS: Lamina cribrosa (LC) cells and ONH astrocytes were used from normal donors of various ages. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to examine mRNA expression of GDNF, Ret, and GFRalpha-1. Western immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry was used to study protein expression of GDNF and GDNF receptor complex proteins in cultured ONH cells. An immunoassay system (ELISA) was used to examine secretion of GDNF by ONH cells. Cell proliferation was examined following exogenous administration of GDNF. RESULTS: Lamina cribrosa cells, ONH astrocytes, and LC tissues expressed messenger RNA for GDNF, Ret and GFRalpha-1. Lamina cribrosa cells and ONH astrocytes also expressed protein for GDNF, Ret, and GFRalpha-1. Secretion of GDNF by either cell type was not detected. Exogenous GDNF caused a significant increase in cell proliferation of LC cells but not ONH astrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Cells from the human lamina cribrosa express mRNA and protein for GDNF and its receptor complex. LC cells proliferate in response to exogenous GDNF. The potential for autocrine and/or paracrine GDNF signaling thus exists within the lamina cribrosa, a tissue involved in glaucoma pathogenesis.
8260160	Retinopathy after low-dose retinal irradiation.	A 28-year-old man, after subtotal resection of a Grade I-II frontal lobe astrocytoma, received 5600 cGy of radiotherapy in 200 cGy fractions to residual intracranial tumour. One year later he presented with severe bilateral retinopathy which, in appearance was consistent with retinopathy from irradiation. Total irradiation received by the retina of each eye (< 50 to 1500 cGy) was far less than the dose which commonly produces radiation retinopathy. Also, the pattern of retinopathy did not reflect the distribution of radiation received by the eye. Alternative causes for the retinopathy were sought but not found. Proliferative retinopathy occurred in each eye and one eye developed a dense vitreous haemorrhage. Argon laser pan-retinal photocoagulation controlled the neovascularisation in the other eye. This patient has developed severe retinal ischaemia after a low dose of retinal irradiation.
8657282	GDNF signalling through the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase.	Mutational analysis in humans and mice has demonstrated that the Ret, the product of the c-ret proto-oncogene, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) superfamily, is essential for development of the enteric nervous system and kidney. Despite the established role of Ret in mammalian embryogenesis, its cognate ligand(s) is currently unknown. Here we demonstrate, by using a Xenopus embryo bioassay, that glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a distant member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily, signals through the Ret RTK. Furthermore, using explant cultures from wild-type and Ret-deficient mouse embryos, we show that normal c-ret function is necessary for GDNF signalling in the peripheral nervous system. Our data strongly suggest that Ret is a functional receptor for GDNF, and that GDNF, in addition to its potential role in the differentiation and survival of central nervous system neurons, has profound effects on kidney organogenesis and the development of the peripheral nervous system.
9152004	The molecular basis of embryonic kidney development.	The development of the mature mammalian kidney begins with the invasion of metanephric mesenchyme by ureteric bud. Mesenchymal cells near the bud become induced and convert to an epithelium which goes on to generate the functional filtering unit of the kidney, the nephron. The collecting duct system is elaborated by the branching ureter, the growth of which is dependent upon signals from the metanephric mesenchyme. The process of reciprocal induction between ureter and mesenchyme is repeated many times over during development and is the key step in generating the overall architecture of the kidney. Genetic studies in mice have allowed researchers to begin to unravel the molecular signals that govern these early events. These experiments have revealed that a number of essential gene products are required for distinct steps in kidney organogenesis. Here we review and summarize the developmental role played by some of these molecules, especially certain transcription factors and growth factors and their receptors. Although the factors involved are far from completely known a rough framework of a molecular cascade which governs embryonic kidney development is beginning to emerge.
9681850	Molecular biology of the MEN2 gene.	Cancer is a genetic disease caused by 'gain of function' mutations of oncogenes and 'loss of function' mutations of tumour suppressors and of genes involved in DNA repair mechanisms. The RET gene encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor for molecules belonging to the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family. RET is a paradigmatic example of how different mutations of a single gene can lead to different neoplastic phenotypes. Indeed, gene rearrangements, often caused by chromosomal inversions, activate the oncogenic potential of RET in a fraction of human thyroid papillary carcinomas. On the other hand, different point mutations activate RET in familial multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), MEN-2A and MEN-2B. Little information is so far available on the biochemical mechanisms by which the potent transforming and mitogenic signals of RET are delivered to the nucleus. However, recent data indicate coupling to the Shc-Ras-MAPK pathway as a necessary step in RET signal transduction.
9697851	GFRalpha1 is an essential receptor component for GDNF in the developing nervous system and kidney.	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a distant member of the TGFbeta protein family that is essential for neuronal survival and renal morphogenesis. We show that mice who are deficient in the glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol (GPI) -linked protein GFRalpha1 (GDNFRalpha) display deficits in the kidneys, the enteric nervous system, and spinal motor and sensory neurons that are strikingly similar to those of the GDNF- and Ret-deficient mice. GFRalpha1-deficient dopaminergic and nodose sensory ganglia neurons no longer respond to GDNF or to the structurally related protein neurturin (NTN) but can be rescued when exposed to GDNF or neurturin in the presence of soluble GFRalpha1. In contrast, GFRalpha1-deficient submandibular parasympathetic neurons retain normal response to these two factors. Taken together with the available genetic and biochemical data, these findings support the idea that GFRalpha1 and the transmembrane tyrosine kinase Ret are both necessary receptor components for GDNF in the developing kidney and nervous system, and that GDNF and neurturin can mediate some of their activities through a second receptor.
10601639	GDNF triggers a novel ret-independent Src kinase family-coupled signaling via a GPI-linked GDNF receptor alpha1.	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has potentially great clinical importance in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and several other neurodegenerative diseases, however its intracellular signaling mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that upon GDNF binding glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked GDNF receptor alpha1 (GFRalpha1) activates cytoplasmic Src family tyrosine kinase(s) in Ret tyrosine kinase-deficient cultured mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons and in two Ret-negative cell lines. GFRalpha1-mediated Src-type kinase activation subsequently triggers phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, cAMP response element binding protein and phospholipase Cgamma. We therefore conclude that GDNF can activate intracellular signaling pathways Ret-independently via GPI-linked GFRalpha1.
10712625	A dynamic regulation of GDNF-family receptors correlates with a specific trophic dependency of cranial motor neuron subpopulations during development.	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands promote the survival of developing motor neurons in vivo and in vitro. However, not all neurons survive with any single ligand in culture and GDNF null mutant mice display only a partial motor neuron loss. An interesting possibility is that subpopulations of motor neurons based on their function and/or their myotopic organization require distinct members of GDNF family ligands. Because responsiveness to the different ligands depends on the expression of their cognate ligand-binding receptor we have herein addressed this issue by examining the expression of GDNF-family receptors (gfr) during development and in the adult in cranial motor nuclei subpopulations. We have furthermore examined the in vivo role of GDNF for cranial motor neuron subpopulations. The shared ret receptor was expressed in all somatic, branchial and visceral cranial embryonic motor nuclei examined, showing that they are all competent to respond to GDNF family ligands during development. At early stages of development both the GDNF receptor, gfralpha1, and the neurturin (NTN) receptor, gfralpha2, were expressed in the oculomotor, facial and spinal accessory, and only gfralpha1 in the trochlear, superior salivatory, trigeminal, hypoglossal and weakly in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the ambiguous nucleus. The abducens nucleus was negative for both gfralpha1 and gfralpha2. The artemin (ART) receptor, gfralpha3, was expressed only in the superior salivatory nucleus. A motor neuron subnuclei-specific expression of gfralpha1 and gfralpha2 was seen in the facial and trigeminal nuclei which corresponded to their dependence on GDNF in null mutant mice. We found that the expression was dynamic in these nuclei, which may reflect developmental changes in their trophic factor dependency. Analysis of GDNF null mutant mice revealed that the dynamic receptor expression is regulated by the ligand in vivo, indicating that the attainment of changes in dependency could be ligand induced. Our results indicate that specific GDNF family ligands support selective muscle-motor neuron circuits during development.
10717236	Glial cell line-derived neutrotrophic factor and neurturin can act as paracrine growth factors stimulating DNA synthesis of Ret-expressing spermatogonia.	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NTN) are related growth factors which exert trophic effects on several neuronal populations and developing kidney. GDNF-family ligands interact with membrane receptors designated GFRalphas which, in turn, mediate stimulation of the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase. Here we show that Ret, GFRalpha-1 (the GDNF receptor), and GFRalpha-2 (the NTN receptor) are expressed by testicular germ cells, while GDNF and NTN are expressed by Sertoli cells. Both GDNF and NTN stimulate DNA synthesis in spermatogonia. Furthermore, Ret, ligands and co-receptors are expressed in germ cell tumors. Thus, GDNF-family ligands may act as paracrine factors in spermatogenesis and this circuit may be active in germ cell tumors.
11003838	Developmental regulation of GDNF response and receptor expression in the enteric nervous system.	The development of the enteric nervous system is dependent upon the actions of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) on neural crest-derived precursor cells in the embryonic gut. GDNF treatment of cultured enteric precursor cells leads to an increase in the number of neurons that develop and/or survive. Here we demonstrate that, although GDNF promoted an increase in neuron number at all embryonic ages examined, there was a developmental shift from a mitogenic to a trophic response by the developing enteric neurons. The timing of this shift corresponded to developmental changes in gut expression of GFR alpha-1, a co-receptor in the GDNF-Ret signaling complex. GFR alpha-1 was broadly expressed in the gut at early developmental stages, at which times soluble GFR alpha-1 was released into the medium by cultured gut cells. At later times, GFR alpha-1 became restricted to neural crest-derived cells. GFR alpha-1 could participate in GDNF signaling when expressed in cis on the surface of enteric precursor cells, or as a soluble protein. The GDNF-mediated response was greater when cell surface, compared with soluble, GFR alpha-1 was present, with the maximal response seen the presence of both cis and trans forms of GFR alpha-1. In addition to contributing to GDNF signaling, cell-surface GFR alpha-1 modulated the specificity of interactions between GDNF and soluble GFR alphas. These experiments demonstrate that complex, developmentally regulated, signaling interactions contribute to the GDNF-dependent development of enteric neurons.
11512671	Glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor induces nerve fibre formation in primary cultures of adrenal chromaffin cells.	Neurotrophic factors, such as nerve growth factor (NGF), have been shown to promote the differentiation of neural crest neuroblasts into sympathetic neurons, whereas glucocorticoids promote the endocrine phenotype of adrenal medullary chromaffin cells. This pluripotency is preserved to some extent in adult chromaffin cells, with NGF and other neurotrophic factors influencing the differentiation of these cells. In this study, the effects of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) on explanted chromaffin tissue have been investigated. The localization of mRNAs corresponding to the two components of the GDNF receptor, GDNF family receptor alpha 1 (GFRalpha1) and Ret, were demonstrated in adult adrenal medullary ganglion cells. GFRalpha1 mRNA was expressed in explanted chromaffin tissue at levels dependent on the presence of serum in the medium but decreased on the addition of blocking antibodies against transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta). However, TGFbeta1 (1 ng/ml) did not upregulate GFRalpha1 mRNA expression when added to serum-free medium. GDNF induced neurite formation from chromaffin cells, as measured by the ratio of neurite-bearing versus total number of chromaffin cells in primary cultures of adult adrenal medulla. The most potent dose inducing neurites from chromaffin cells was 100 ng/ml GDNF. However, this dose was not as efficient as that seen when chromaffin cells were stimulated with NGF (100 ng/ml). Thus, adrenal medullary cells express mRNAs for the GDNF receptor components Ret and GFRalpha1, increase their expression upon being cultured in serum-containing medium and respond to GDNF treatment with an increase in the number of cells that develop nerve processes.
11546745	Identification of pleiotrophin as a mesenchymal factor involved in ureteric bud branching morphogenesis.	Branching morphogenesis is central to epithelial organogenesis. In the developing kidney, the epithelial ureteric bud invades the metanephric mesenchyme, which directs the ureteric bud to undergo repeated branching. A soluble factor(s) in the conditioned medium of a metanephric mesenchyme cell line is essential for multiple branching morphogenesis of the isolated ureteric bud. The identity of this factor had proved elusive, but it appeared distinct from factors such as HGF and EGF receptor ligands that have been previously implicated in branching morphogenesis of mature epithelial cell lines. Using sequential column chromatography, we have now purified to apparent homogeneity an 18 kDa protein, pleiotrophin, from the conditioned medium of a metanephric mesenchyme cell line that induces isolated ureteric bud branching morphogenesis in the presence of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor. Pleiotrophin alone was also found to induce the formation of branching tubules in an immortalized ureteric bud cell line cultured three-dimensionally in an extracellular matrix gel. Consistent with an important role in ureteric bud morphogenesis during kidney development, pleiotrophin was found to localize to the basement membrane of the developing ureteric bud in the embryonic kidney. We suggest that pleiotrophin could act as a key mesenchymally derived factor regulating branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud and perhaps other embryonic epithelial structures.
12478607	Developmental expression of glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor, neurturin, and their receptor mRNA in the rat urinary bladder.	AIMS: Glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and related factors neurturin (NRTN), artemin, and persephin are members of the GDNF family of neurotrophic factors. GDNF and NRTN bind to the tyrosine kinase receptor Ret and the receptors GFRalpha1 and GFRalpha2. The objective was to examine the developmental expression of GDNF, NRTN, and their receptors within the rat urinary bladder. METHODS: Rat bladders dissected from embryonic day (E) 15, postnatal day (P) 0, P14, P28, and adult rats (P60) were investigated by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Embryos (E15, E16, and E17) were immunohistochemically stained for neurofilament. RESULTS: GDNF and Ret mRNA levels at E15 were the highest of all the stages we examined and then immediately decreased. In contrast, NRTN mRNA levels did not change between E15 and postnatal day 14; thereafter, they gradually but insignificantly increased. GFRalpha1 and GFRalpha2 mRNA levels were high at E15, after which their signal intensities decreased. In whole-mounted specimens, neurofilament-positive axons were first detected in the bladder at E16. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that GDNF and NRTN may act as trophic factors for neural in-growth to the bladder and/or for the maintenance of mature neurons innervating the bladder. These factors might also be involved in bladder morphogenesis.
9215674	Genetic predisposition to phaeochromocytoma: analysis of candidate genes GDNF, RET and VHL.	Inherited predisposition to phaeochromocytoma (MIM No 171300) occurs in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) (MIM No 171400), von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease (MIM No 199300), and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) (MIM No 162200). In addition, familial phaeochromocytoma alone has also been reported and we and others have identified germline VHL mutations in five of six kindreds analysed previously. Germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, and in the VHL tumour suppressor gene cause MEN 2 and VHL disease, respectively. To further investigate the genetics of phaeochromocytoma predisposition, we analysed three groups of patients with no evidence of VHL disease, MEN 2 or NF1: Group A, eight kindreds with familial phaeochromocytoma; Group B, two patients with isolated bilateral phaeochromocytoma; and Group C, six cases of multiple extra-adrenal phaeochromocytoma or adrenal phaeochromocytoma with a family history of neuroectodermal tumours. Germline missense VHL mutations were identified in three of eight kindreds with familial phaeochromocytoma. A germline VHL mutation was also characterised in one of the two patients with bilateral phaeochromocytoma. No VHL or RET mutations were detected in the final group of patients with multiple extra-adrenal phaeochromocytoma or adrenal phaeochromocytoma with a family history of neuroectodermal tumours. The absence of germline VHL and RET gene mutations in many of these families suggested that other phaeochromoeytoma susceptibility loci may exist. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been recently identified as a natural ligand for RET. Thus, it seems plausible that GDNF is a good candidate gene to play a role in phaeochromocytoma susceptibility. We searched for germline mutations in GDNF in 16 cases of familial phaeochromocytoma (groups A, B and C) and looked for evidence of somatic change in GDNF in 28 sporadic phaeochromocytomas, 12 MEN 2 phaeochromocytomas and five VHL phaeochromocytomas. No GDNF mutations were identified in patients with familial phaeochromocytoma disease, but a c277C-->T (R93W) sequence variant was identified in one of 28 sporadic tumours. This candidate mutation was identified in the germline and tumour tissue but was not present in 104 control GDNF alleles. GDNF sequence variants including R93W have been suggested previously to represent low penetrance susceptibility mutations for Hirschsprung disease and the R93W was not identified in 376 control alleles studied by others. These findings suggest that although GDNF mutations do not appear to have a major role in the pathogenesis of familial or sporadic phaeochromocytomas, allelic variation at the GDNF locus may modify phaeochromocytoma susceptibility.
9879991	Dual effect on the RET receptor of MEN 2 mutations affecting specific extracytoplasmic cysteines.	The RET gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase whose function is essential during the development of kidney and the intestinal nervous system. Germline mutations affecting one of five cysteines (Cys609, 611, 618, 620 and 634) located in the juxtamembrane domain of the RET receptor are responsible for the vast majority of two cancer-prone disorders, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A) and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). These mutations lead to the replacement of a cysteine by an alternate amino acid. Mutations of the RET gene are also the underlying genetic cause of Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), a congenital aganglionosis of the hindgut. In a fraction of kindreds, MEN 2A cosegregate with HSCR and affected individuals carry a single mutation at codons 609, 618 or 620. To examine the consequences of cysteine substitution on RET function, we have introduced a Cys to Arg mutation into the wild-type RET at either codons 609, 618, 620, 630 or 634. We now report that each mutation induces a constitutive catalytic activity due to the aberrant disulfide homodimerization of RET. However, mutations 630 and 634 activate RET more strongly than mutations 609, 618 or 620 as demonstrated by quantitative assays in rodent fibroblasts and pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Biochemical analysis revealed that mutations 618 and 620, and to a lesser extent mutation 609, result in a marked reduction of the level of RET at the cell surface and as a consequence decrease the amount of RET covalent dimer. These findings provide a molecular basis explaining the range of phenotype engendered by alterations of RET cysteines and suggest a novel mechanism whereby mutations of cysteines 609, 618 and 620 exert both activating and inactivating effects.
12414995	Signalling by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) requires heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycan.	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, GDNF, is vital to the development and maintenance of neural tissues; it promotes survival of sympathetic, parasympathetic and spinal motor neurons during development, protects midbrain dopaminergic neurons from apoptosis well enough to be a promising treatment for Parkinson's disease, and controls renal and testicular development. Understanding how GDNF interacts with its target cells is therefore a priority in several fields. Here we show that GDNF requires glycosaminoglycans as well as the already-known components of its receptor complex, c-Ret and GFRalpha-1. Without glycosaminoglcyans, specifically heparan sulphate, c-Ret phosphorylation fails and GDNF cannot induce axonogenesis in neurons, in PC-12 cells, or scatter of epithelial cells. Furthermore, exogenous heparan sulphate inhibits rather than assists GDNF signalling. The involvement of heparan sulphates in GDNF signalling raises the possibility that modulation of heparan expression may modulate signalling by GDNF in vivo.
8023872	Management of complex retinal detachment with combined relaxing retinotomy and intravitreal perfluoro-n-octane injection.	We evaluated intravitreal perfluoro-n-octane injection for the positioning of large retinal flaps after relaxing retinotomies. Nineteen eyes underwent vitrectomy for advanced retinal detachments from proliferative vitreoretinopathy (11 eyes), trauma (five eyes), and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (three eyes). After retinotomy and complete relief of traction, injection of perfluoro-n-octane to a level anterior to the retinotomy edge was used to remove subretinal fluid thoroughly from beneath the retinal flap. All irrigation fluid anterior to the perfluoro-n-octane meniscus was aspirated before perfluoro-n-octane removal. Final tamponade was obtained with gas (four eyes) or silicone oil (15 eyes). After six to 17 eyes) or silicone oil (15 eyes). After six to 17 months of follow-up, the retinas were attached in 13 eyes (68%), and visual acuity of 5/200 or better was obtained in eight eyes (42%). Subretinal migration of perfluoro-n-octane and posterior slippage of the retinal flap occurred during perfluoro-n-octane/silicone oil exchange in one eye. No other complications were detected. Perfluoro-n-octane injection is an effective technique for positioning large retinal flaps after relaxing retinotomy.
8995255	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor induces Ret-mediated lamellipodia formation.	Ret is a receptor tyrosine kinase required during embryogenesis for the survival of enteric and sympathetic neuroblasts. Recently, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been identified as a ligand for Ret. We investigated early events in GDNF-induced signal transduction. We show that GDNF activates the Ras-ERK2 signaling pathway in SK-N-MC cells stably transfected with a full-length Ret construct. In addition, activation of Ret tyrosine kinase activity, either via GDNF stimulation of full-length Ret or via epidermal growth factor stimulation of an epidermal growth factor receptor-Ret chimeric receptor, results in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent formation of large lamellipodia. Our results indicate that GDNF can serve as a genuine ligand for Ret. In addition, we show that GDNF can induce Ret-mediated formation of lamellipodia, cell surface protrusions that are implicated in neuritogenesis.
9647690	GFRalpha-4, a new GDNF family receptor.	GFRalpha-1, GFRalpha-2, and GFRalpha-3 constitute a family of structurally related, glycosyl-phosphatidylinosital-linked, cell surface proteins, two of which, GFRalpha-1 and GFRalpha-2, are components of the receptor complex for the neurotrophic factors GDNF and neurturin, respectively. By screening an embryonic chicken brain cDNA library with a GFRalpha-1 probe at low stringency, we isolated cDNAs encoding an additional member of the GFRalpha family, GFRalpha-4. The nucleotide sequence predicts a 431-amino-acid secreted protein that is more closely related to GFRalpha-1 and GFRalpha-2 than to GFRalpha-3. GFRalpha-4 mRNA is expressed in distinctive patterns in the brain and several other organs and tissues of the chicken embryo. Our findings extend the family of GFRalpha proteins and provide information about the tissues in which GFRalpha-4 may function during development.
10426588	Infrequent detectable somatic mutations of the RET and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) genes in human pituitary adenomas.	RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in neuroendocrine cells and tumors. RET is activated by a ligand complex comprising glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and GDNF receptor-alpha (GDNFR-alpha). Activating mutations of the RET proto-oncogene were found in multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2 and in sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma of neuroendocrine origin. Mutations of the RET proto-oncogene and the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) gene were examined in human pituitary tumors. No mutations of the RET proto-oncogene including the cysteine-rich region or codon 768 and 918 in the tyrosine kinase domain were detected in 172 human pituitary adenomas either by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) or by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Further, somatic mutations of the GDNF gene in 33 human pituitary adenomas were not detected by PCR-SSCP. One polymorphism of the GDNF gene at codon 145 of TGC or TGT was observed in a prolactinoma. The RET proto-oncogene message was detected in a normal human pituitary gland or 4 of 4 human pituitary adenomas with reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and in rodent pituitary tumor cell lines with Western blotting. The expression of GDNF gene was detected in 1 of 4 human somatotroph adenomas, 1 of 2 corticotroph adenomas, and 2 of 6 rodent pituitary tumor cell lines with RT-PCR. Based on these, it is concluded that somatic mutations of the RET proto-oncogene or the GDNF gene do not appear to play a major role in the pituitary tumorigenesis in examined tumors.
11493536	Hoxa11 and Hoxd11 regulate branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud in the developing kidney.	Hoxa11 and Hoxd11 are functionally redundant during kidney development. Mice with homozygous null mutation of either gene have normal kidneys, but double mutants have rudimentary, or in extreme cases, absent kidneys. We have examined the mechanism for renal growth failure in this mouse model and find defects in ureteric bud branching morphogenesis. The ureteric buds are either unbranched or have an atypical pattern characterized by lack of terminal branches in the midventral renal cortex. The mutant embryos show that Hoxa11 and Hoxd11 control development of a dorsoventral renal axis. By immunohistochemical analysis, Hoxa11 expression is restricted to the early metanephric mesenchyme, which induces ureteric bud formation and branching. It is not found in the ureteric bud. This suggests that the branching defect had been caused by failure of mesenchyme to epithelium signaling. In situ hybridizations with Wnt7b, a marker of the metanephric kidney, show that the branching defect was not simply the result of homeotic transformation of metanephros to mesonephros. Absent Bf2 and Gdnf expression in the midventral mesenchyme, findings that could by themselves account for branching defects, shows that Hoxa11 and Hoxd11 are necessary for normal gene expression in the ventral mesenchyme. Attenuation of normal gene expression along with the absence of a detectable proliferative or apoptotic change in the mutants show that one function of Hoxa11 and Hoxd11 in the developing renal mesenchyme is to regulate differentiation necessary for mesenchymal-epithelial reciprocal inductive interactions.
11696976	Genomic organisation of the mouse Ret proto-oncogene.	The RET proto-oncogene is involved in the development of both kidney and neural crests derived tissues. RET deleterious mutations cause hereditary neuroendocrine tumours and congenital intestinal aganglionosis. Ongoing efforts aimed at elucidating the function of this gene include expression studies in different species and in transgenic mice. As first step in the study of Ret expression in mouse, we obtained the mouse Ret genomic structure. Intron-exon boundaries were determined and sequenced, all introns but the first one were amplified and cloned, and exons positioned in a restriction map. Mouse and human genes comparison indicates a highly conserved genomic organisation, except for exon 21 which is not conserved in mouse. A region extending 386 bp 5' to the first exon was sequenced and compared with its human counterpart. Some features, reported for the human promoter, like the absence of TATA or CAAT boxes and a high GC content, are conserved.
11937757	Genes and proteins in renal development.	Metanephric kidney development begins with the formation of the metanephrogenic mesenchyme; this event depends on the prior action in the intermediate mesoderm of transcription factors such as Lim-1, Pax-2, Eya-1, and Foxc-1. Once it has formed, the mesenchyme secretes GDNF; this induces the nearby wolffian duct to produce a ureteric bud which invades the metanephrogenic mesenchyme and begins to arborize. Ureteric bud development and branching depends on the transcription factor Emx-2, the GDNF-cRet and probably the HGF/cMet, signalling systems, and the intracellular regulatory molecules formin IV and timeless. Proteins of the BMP family modulate ureteric bud branching and keep bud development in step with that of other tissue types. Proteins and glycosaminoglycans of the matrix, and their receptors, and also required. The metanephrogenic mesenchyme has a default fate of apoptosis and is dissuaded from suicide by factors secreted from the bud such as TGF-alpha, TIMP-2, EGF, and FGF-2. Other factors such as LIF and TGFbeta2 cooperate with these to induce clumps of mesenchyme cells to differentiate into nephrons, while BMP-7 appears to lead them instead to form stroma. As nephrons form, they express critical transcription factors such as WT-1, Pax-2, and Hoxa11 and d11, condense, and secrete Wnt-4. Wnt-4 acts in an autocrine loop to stimulate its own synthesis and is required for cells to differentiate into epithelia; its action is antagonized by sFRP-1, secreted by stroma, but this antagonism is itself inhibited by sFRP-2 made by the developing nephron. This system probably acts both to limit the spread of Wnt-4's influence and also to commit responding cells to their epithelial fate. As nephrons mature, regions of them differentiate to perform specific physiological functions, a process that requires the proteins WT-1, Lmx-1b, Notch-2, Jagged-1, and Hnf-1.
12139916	High-level expression of receptor tyrosine kinase Ret and responsiveness to Ret-activating ligands in pheochromocytoma cell lines from neurofibromatosis knockout mice.	Pheochromocytoma cell lines derived from neurofibromatosis knockout mice express high levels of the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret, which is involved in the pathogenesis of human pheochromocytomas in hereditary multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2). Mouse pheochromocytoma (MPC) cells respond to the Ret-activating ligand GDNF by exhibiting Ret phosphorylation, neurite outgrowth, decreased proliferation, and altered expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes. GDNF exerts similar effects on human pheochromocytoma cells in primary cultures. Ret is minimally expressed by normal mouse chromaffin cells, from which pheochromocytomas are derived. Its expression at high levels by MPC cells suggests possible relationships between two previously unrelated tumor syndromes, neurofibromatosis, and MEN2. The responsiveness of these cells to GDNF suggests that they may be a valuable new model for neurobiology.
8157860	High concentrations of vitamin A esters circulate primarily as retinyl stearate and are stored primarily as retinyl palmitate in ferret tissues.	OBJECTIVE AND METHODOLOGY: We determined the kinds and amounts of vitamin A compounds (retinol and various retinyl esters) circulating in serum and stored in liver and other selected tissues of ferrets, using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The concentration of total retinyl esters in serum (43 +/- 1 mumol/L, mean +/- SEM) was 25 times greater than that of retinol (1.7 +/- 0.2 mumol/L). In serum, 56% of retinyl esters was retinyl stearate, 33% was retinyl palmitate, and 5% was retinyl oleate. In contrast, in liver, vitamin A was stored primarily as retinyl palmitate (51%); smaller amounts of retinyl oleate (19%) and retinyl stearate (16%) were found. In kidneys, adrenals, small intestine, adipose tissue, skin, stomach, and eyes, retinyl palmitate was also the predominant retinyl ester, followed by retinyl stearate. In colon, lungs, and bladder, equal amounts of retinyl palmitate and retinyl stearate were observed. Other retinyl esters present in smaller amounts in most of these tissues were retinyl oleate, retinyl linoleate and/or -myristate, retinyl heptadecanoate, retinyl arachidonate, and retinyl laurate. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the primary form of vitamin A that circulates in the blood of ferrets is retinyl stearate, whereas the primary storage form of the vitamin in tissues is retinyl palmitate. Concentrations of total vitamin A in ferret serum and other tissues were 3-73 times greater than those reported for their corresponding human tissues.
9728913	GFR alpha1-deficient mice have deficits in the enteric nervous system and kidneys.	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) signals through a receptor complex composed of the Ret tyrosine kinase and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol- (GPI-) anchored cell surface coreceptor, either GDNF family receptor alpha1 (GFR alpha1) or GFR alpha2. To investigate the usage of these coreceptors for GDNF signaling in vivo, gene targeting was used to produce mice lacking the GFR alpha1 coreceptor. GFR alpha1-deficient mice demonstrate absence of enteric neurons and agenesis of the kidney, characteristics that are reminiscent of both GDNF- and Ret-deficient mice. Midbrain dopaminergic and motor neurons in GFR alpha1 null mice were normal. Minimal or no neuronal losses were observed in a number of peripheral ganglia examined, including the superior cervical and nodose, which are severely affected in both Ret- and GDNF-deficient mice. These results suggest that while stringent physiologic pairing exists between GFR alpha1 and GDNF in renal and enteric nervous system development, significant cross-talk between GDNF and other GFR alpha coreceptors must occur in other neuronal populations.
10068631	Dominant effects of RET receptor misexpression and ligand-independent RET signaling on ureteric bud development.	During kidney development, factors from the metanephric mesenchyme induce the growth and repeated branching of the ureteric bud, which gives rise to the collecting duct system and also induces nephrogenesis. One signaling pathway known to be required for this process includes the receptor tyrosine kinase RET and co-receptor GFR(&agr;)-1, which are expressed in the ureteric bud, and the secreted ligand GDNF produced in the mesenchyme. To examine the role of RET signaling in ureteric bud morphogenesis, we produced transgenic mice in which the pattern of RET expression was altered, or in which a ligand-independent form of RET kinase was expressed. The Hoxb7 promoter was used to express RET throughout the ureteric bud branches, in contrast to its normal expression only at the bud tips. This caused a variable inhibition of ureteric bud growth and branching reminiscent of, but less severe than, the RET knockout phenotype. Manipulation of the level of GDNF, in vitro or in vivo, suggested that this defect was due to insufficient rather than excessive RET signaling. We propose that RET receptors expressed ectopically on ureteric bud trunk cells sequester GDNF, reducing its availability to the normal target cells at the bud tips. When crossed to RET knockout mice, the Hoxb7/RET transgene, which encoded the RET9 isoform, supported normal kidney development in some RET-/- animals, indicating that the other major isoform, RET51, is not required in this organ. Expression of a Hoxb7/RET-PTC2 transgene, encoding a ligand-independent form of RET kinase, caused the development of abnormal nodules, outside the kidney or at its periphery, containing branched epithelial tubules apparently formed by deregulated growth of the ureteric bud. This suggests that RET signaling is not only necessary but is sufficient to induce ureteric bud growth, and that the orderly, centripetal growth of the bud tips is controlled by the spatially and temporally regulated expression of GDNF and RET.
11324313	[Molecular genetics of Hirschsprung disease: a model of multigenic neurocristopathy].	Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR, aganglionic megacolon) is a frequent congenital malformation regarded as a multigenic neurocristopathy. Three susceptibility genes have been recently identified in HSCR, namely the RET proto-oncogene, the endothelin B receptor (EDNRB) gene, and the endothelin 3 (EDN3) gene. RET gene mutations were found in significant proportions of familial (50%) and sporadic (15-20%) HSCR, while homozygosity for EDNRB or EDN3 mutations accounted for the rare HSCR-Waardenburg syndrome (WS) association. More recently, heterozygous EDNRB an EDN3 missense mutations have been reported in isolated HSCR patients. Some of these results were obtained after the identification of mouse genes whose natural or site-directed mutations resulted in megacolon and coat color spotting. There is also conclusive evidence for the involvement of other independent loci in HSCR. In particular, the recent identification of neurotrophic factors acting as RET ligands (GDNF and Neurturin) provide additional candidate genes for HSCR. The dissection of the genetic etiology of HSCR disease may then provide a unique opportunity to distinguish between a polygenic and a genetically heterogeneous disease, thereby helping to understand other complex disorders and congenital malformations hitherto considered as multifactorial in origin. Finally, the study of the molecular bases of HSCR is also a step towards the understanding of developmental genetics of the enteric nervous system giving support to the role of the tyrosine kinase and endothelin-signaling pathways in the development of neural crest-derived enteric neurons in human.
11585803	GDNF and neurturin are target-derived factors essential for cranial parasympathetic neuron development.	During development, parasympathetic ciliary ganglion neurons arise from the neural crest and establish synaptic contacts on smooth and striate muscle in the eye. The factors that promote the ciliary ganglion pioneer axons to grow toward their targets have yet to be determined. Here, we show that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NRTN) constitute target-derived factors for developing ciliary ganglion neurons. Both GDNF and NRTN are secreted from eye muscle located in the target and trajectory pathway of ciliary ganglion pioneer axons during the period of target innervation. After this period, however, the synthesis of GDNF declines markedly, while that of NRTN is maintained throughout the cell death period. Furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo function-blocking of GDNF at early embryonic ages almost entirely suppresses ciliary axon outgrowth. These results demonstrate that target-derived GDNF is necessary for ciliary ganglion neurons to innervate ciliary muscle in the eye. Since the down-regulation of GDNF in the eye is accompanied by down-regulation of GFRalpha1 and Ret, but not of GFRalpha2, in innervating ciliary ganglion neurons, the results also suggest that target-derived GDNF regulates the expression of its high-affinity coreceptors.
12165857	RET receptor tyrosine kinase isoforms in kidney function and disease.	The RET proto-oncogene encodes two major isoforms, RET9 and RET51, which differ at the carboxyl-terminal. Loss-of-function mutations in RET result in gut aganglionosis while gain of function mutations result in cancer syndromes. From studies on transgenic mice, RET9 is important for early development of the kidney and the enteric nervous system. Little is known about the function of RET isoforms in later life. Here we report the expression of RET isoforms and its signalling complex, GDNF and GFRalpha1, in foetal and adult human kidneys. We found their expression in both the developing and the adult renal collecting system. We further show that only RET51 but not RET9 could promote the survival and tubulogenesis of mIMCD3 (mouse inner medullary collecting duct) cells in collagen gel. Our results agree with the hypothesis that RET51 signalling is related to differentiation events in later kidney organogenesis. In addition, it may also have a function in the adult kidney. We further extend our study by showing increased RET and GDNF expression in collecting duct cysts of polycystic kidney patients. This suggests that GDNF/RET signalling may contribute to proliferation of the collecting duct epithelium in an autocrine/paracrine manner.
12660411	Biology of congenital obstructive nephropathy.	Congenital obstructive nephropathy is a common disease affecting fetuses and young children. The kidney shows profound morphologic and functional changes. The physiologic developmental kidney program is disturbed in the most advanced cases, arguing for altered temporal/spatial expression of genes which control normal nephrogenesis. Major regulators of mesenchymal-epithelial transformation and collecting duct and tubular development such as WT1 and Sall1 are decreased with obstruction. Additional candidate genes include GDNF/cRET, LIM1 and Pax2. Excessive apoptosis is an undisputed mechanism in these processes, mediated by decreased expression of apoptosis inhibiting genes (Bcl-2, HGF, IGF, BMP7), and overexpression of pro-apoptotic genes like Bax and TGF-beta. Renin and AT2R implicated in renal vascular development are decreased. Numerous extracellular matrix genes including Matrilysin are altered. The emerging theories of the biology of congenital obstructive nephropathy suggest new targets for therapeutic interventions with profound implications for these children.
9192899	Neurturin responsiveness requires a GPI-linked receptor and the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase.	Neurturin (NTN) is a recently identified homologue of glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Both factors promote the survival of a variety of neurons, and GDNF is required for the development of the enteric nervous system and kidney. GDNF signals through a receptor complex consisting of the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret and a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked receptor termed GDNFR-alpha. Here we report the cloning of a new GPI-linked receptor termed NTNR-alpha that is homologous with GDNFR-alpha and is widely expressed in the nervous system and other tissues. By using microinjection to introduce expression plasmids into neurons, we show that coexpression of NTNR-alpha with Ret confers a survival response to neurturin but not GDNF, and that coexpression of GDNFR-alpha with Ret confers a survival response to GDNF but not neurturin. Our findings indicate that GDNF and neurturin promote neuronal survival by signalling through similar multicomponent receptors that consist of a common receptor tyrosine kinase and a member of a GPI-linked family of receptors that determines ligand specificity.
9405108	GDNF induces branching and increased cell proliferation in the ureter of the mouse.	The secreted signaling molecule GDNF is expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme and has recently been implicated as a factor necessary for development of the metanephric kidney. We have examined the effects of GDNF on mouse kidney explants. We show that GDNF increases cell proliferation in ureter tips. There is an increase in the number of ureter tips and expansion and fusion of adjacent tips and some tips appear to grow toward the source of GDNF. These events are accompanied by transcriptional upregulation of several genes localized to the tips, including its own receptor, c-ret, the transcription factor Sox9, and the signal Wnt-11. These results support a model in which GDNF supplied by the mesenchyme regulates growth and branching in the metanephric kidney through the local regulation of ureter tip-specific factors.
10978357	Characterisation of the human GFRalpha-3 locus and investigation of the gene in Hirschsprung disease.	BACKGROUND: The GDNF family receptor alpha (GFRalpha) proteins are extracellular cell surface bound molecules that act as adapters in binding of the GDNF family of soluble neurotrophic factors to the RET receptor. These molecules are essential for development of many neural crest derived cell types and the kidney. Mutations in RET and in two members of the GDNF ligand family are associated with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), a congenital absence of the enteric ganglia. Members of the GFRalpha family are also candidates for HSCR mutations. One such gene is GFRalpha-3, which is expressed in the peripheral nervous system and developing nerves. OBJECTIVE: We have characterised the structure of the human GFRalpha-3 locus and investigated the gene for sequence variants in a panel of HSCR patients. METHODS: Long range PCR or subcloning of PAC clones was used to investigate GFRalpha-3 intron-exon boundaries. A combination of single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct sequencing was used to investigate GFRalpha-3 sequence variants. RESULTS: GFRalpha-3 spans eight coding exons and has a gene structure and organisation similar to that of GFRalpha-1. We identified three polymorphic variants in GFRalpha-3 in a normal control population, a subset of which also occurred in HSCR patients. We did not detect any sequence variants within the coding sequence of GFRalpha-3. We found a base substitution in the 5' UTR of GFRalpha-3, 15 base pairs upstream of the translation start site. A second substitution was identified in intron 4 (IVS4-30G>A) between the splice branch site and the splice acceptor site. The final variant was a 2 base pair insertion within the splice donor consensus sequence of exon 7 (IVS7+4ins GG). CONCLUSIONS: We did not detect any correlation between variants of GFRalpha-3 and the HSCR phenotype. Our data suggest that mutations of this gene are not a cause of HSCR.
12065680	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family receptors are abnormally expressed in aganglionic bowel of a subpopulation of patients with Hirschsprung's disease.	Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), a congenital disease, is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the ganglion plexuses of the caudal most gut. In the aganglionic colon, the plexus remnants are replaced by aggregates of glial cells and hypertrophied nerve fibers. Signaling of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-GFRAs-receptor tyrosine kinase (RET) is crucial for the development and maintenance of ganglion cells. Mutations of genes such as GDNF and RET lead to the perturbation of this signaling pathway, which causes HSCR. To understand the role of GFRAs in ganglion cells and the pathogenesis of HSCR, we intended to determine the specific cell lineages in the enteric nervous system that normally express GFRAs but are affected in HSCR. We studied colon biopsy specimens from 13 patients with HSCR (aged 1 day to 38 months) and 6 age-matched patients without HSCR as normal controls. RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry were performed to examine the expression and cellular distributions of GFRAs in resected bowel segments of normal infants and those with HSCR. In normal infants and normoganglionic colon of patients with HSCR, the expression of GFRA1 was restricted to the glial cells and neurones of the ganglion plexuses. GFRAs expression was found to be markedly reduced in the aganglionic colons of 3 infants with HSCR but was unaffected in the aganglionic colons of 10 other infants with HSCR. Residual GFRA expression was restricted to enteric glial cells in the plexus remnants of the aganglionic colons. Hypertrophied nerve fibers were not found to express GFRA1. We provide the first evidence that abnormal expression of GFRAs in the enteric nervous system may be involved in the pathogenesis of HSCR in a subpopulation of patients.
9425354	The tip-top branching ureter.	Organ rudiments with their epithelial bud and adjacent mesenchyme look much the same at their initial stage of differentiation. The subsequent branching of the epithelial anlagen determines the final pattern of the organs, but the mesenchyme provides essential signals for epithelial differentiation. Glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has recently been shown to regulate ureteric branching morphogenesis and is thereby the first defined signalling molecule in the embryonic metanephric kidney. GDNF is expressed by the mesenchyme, binds to the tip of the ureteric bud and functions in both bud induction and bud orientation. The active receptor complex for GDNF includes the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret and a novel class of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked receptors, called GDNF family receptor alpha s.

10702420	New roles for glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and neurturin: involvement in hair cycle control.	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neurturin (NTN), and their receptors, GDNF family receptor alpha-1 (GFRalpha-1) and GDNF family receptor alpha-2 (GFRalpha-2), are critically important for kidney and nervous system development. However, their role in skin biology, specifically in hair growth control, is as yet unknown. We have studied expression and function of GDNF, neurturin, GFRalpha-1, and GFRalpha-2 in murine skin during the cyclic transformation of the hair follicle (HF) from its resting state (telogen) to active growth (anagen) and then through regression (catagen) back to telogen. GDNF protein and GFRalpha-1 messenger RNA are prominently expressed in telogen skin, which lacks NTN and GFRalpha-2 transcripts. Early anagen development is accompanied by a significant decline in the skin content of GDNF protein and GFRalpha-1 transcripts. During the anagen-catagen transition, GDNF, GFRalpha-1, NTN, and GFRalpha-2 transcripts reach maximal levels. Compared with wild-type controls, GFRalpha-1 (+/-) and GFRalpha-2 (-/-) knockout mice show a significantly accelerated catagen development. Furthermore, GDNF or NTN administration significantly retards HF regression in organ-cultured mouse skin. This suggests important, previously unrecognized roles for GDNF/GFRalpha-1 and NTN/GFRalpha-2 signaling in skin biology, specifically in the control of apoptosis-driven HF involution, and raises the possibility that GFRalpha-1/GFRalpha-2 agonists/antagonists might become exploitable for the treatment of hair growth disorders that are related to abnormalities in catagen development.
10864958	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and developing mammalian motoneurons: regulation of programmed cell death among motoneuron subtypes.	Because of discrepancies in previous reports regarding the role of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in motoneuron (MN) development and survival, we have reexamined MNs in GDNF-deficient mice and in mice exposed to increased GDNF after in utero treatment or in transgenic animals overexpressing GDNF under the control of the muscle-specific promoter myogenin (myo-GDNF). With the exception of oculomotor and abducens MNs, the survival of all other populations of spinal and cranial MNs were reduced in GDNF-deficient embryos and increased in myo-GDNF and in utero treated animals. By contrast, the survival of spinal sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion and spinal interneurons were not affected by any of the perturbations of GDNF availability. In wild-type control embryos, all brachial and lumbar MNs appear to express the GDNF receptors c-ret and GFRalpha1 and the MN markers ChAT, islet-1, and islet-2, whereas only a small subset express GFRalpha2. GDNF-dependent MNs that are lost in GDNF-deficient animals express ret/GFRalpha1/islet-1, whereas many surviving GDNF-independent MNs express ret/GFRalpha1/GFRalpha2 and islet-1/islet-2. This indicates that many GDNF-independent MNs are characterized by the presence of GFRalpha2/islet-2. It seems likely that the GDNF-independent population represent MNs that require other GDNF family members (neurturin, persephin, artemin) for their survival. GDNF-dependent and -independent MNs may reflect subtypes with distinct synaptic targets and afferent inputs.
11464863	Retinoic acid-induced apoptosis of the CHP134 neuroblastoma cell line is associated with nuclear accumulation of p53 and is rescued by the GDNF/Ret signal.	BACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma (NBL) is one of the most common solid malignancies in childhood and is derived from the sympathetic precursor cells. Although p53, a tumor suppressor, has been reported to be rarely mutated in NBLs, it is sequestered abnormally in the cytoplasm of the NBL cell. The mechanism and functional role of the abnormal intracellular localization of p53 remain unclear. PROCEDURE: Here, we established an in vitro system of apoptosis model using a NBL cell line CHP134 which also showed a cytoplasmic sequestration of p53. The treatment of the cells with 1 or 5 microM all-trans retinoic acid (RA) induced moderate neurite outgrowth followed by massive death of CHP134 cells by days 5 to 6. RESULTS: TUNEL staining showed that the cell death was due to apoptosis. Immunofluorescent stain demonstrated that p53 was strongly positive in the nucleus on day 5, which was accompanied with induction of p21WAF1. In addition, expression of caspase-3 was also increased during the cell death. Intriguingly, the RA treatment induced expression of Ret tyrosine kinase receptor in CHP134 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of ligands, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NTN), inhibited apoptosis as well as nuclear accumulation of p53 in the cell. The present results suggest that the RA-induced apoptosis of NBL cells is associated with activation of both the caspase cascade and the p53-mediated pathway with its nuclear translocation. The neurotrophic signal through the GDNF-Ret system may prevent the neuronal cell death.
8287932	Regional and cell-specific expression of GDNF in rat brain.	The survival of ventral mesencephalic substantia nigra (SN) dopamine neurons, which degenerate in Parkinson's disease, is enhanced by glial cells in vitro. The recent isolation of glial cell line-derived growth factor (GDNF), a molecule with apparently selective effects on dopamine (DA) neurons in vitro, raises the question of whether this factor is found in normal brain cells. In this study, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to determine the regional distribution and cellular localization of GDNF in the rat central nervous system. GDNF was expressed by SN and basal forebrain Type 1 (T1) astrocytes, with trace transcript levels present in cortical T1 astrocytes. Neuronal cultures of embryonic SN also expressed GDNF. Regionally, postnatal striatum contained the highest GDNF mRNA levels in vivo under the PCR conditions employed. Our data suggest a role for GDNF in both local and target-derived support of DA neurons, as well as potential involvement in the support of other neuronal populations in vivo.
10383122	Other neurotrophic factors: glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF).	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was first discovered as a potent survival factor for midbrain dopaminergic neurons and was then shown to rescue these neurons in animal models of Parkinson's disease. GDNF is a more potent survival factor for dopaminergic neurons and the noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus than other neurotrophic factors, and an almost 100 times more efficient survival factor for spinal motor neurons than the neurotrophins. The members of the GDNF family, GDNF, neurturin (NTN), persephin (PSP), and artemin (ART), have seven conserved cysteine residues with similar spacing, making them distant members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. Like the members of the neurotrophin family, the GDNF-like growth factors belong structurally to the cysteine knot proteins. Like neurotrophins, GDNF family proteins are responsible for the development and maintenance of various sets of sensory and sympathetic neurons but, in addition, GDNF and NTN are also responsible for the development and survival of the enteric neurons, and NTN for parasympathetic neurons. All neurotrophins bind to the p75 low-affinity receptor, but their ligand specificity is determined by trk receptor tyrosine kinases. GDNF, NTN, PSP, and ART mediate their signals via a common receptor tyrosine kinase, Ret, but their ligand specificity is determined by a novel class of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins called the GDNF family receptor alpha (GFR alpha). GDNF binds preferentially to GFR alpha1, NTN GFR alpha2, ART GRF alpha3, and PSP GFR alpha4 as a co-receptor to activate Ret. GFR alpha4 has until now been described only from chicken. Although the GDNF family members signal mainly via Ret receptor tyrosine kinase, there is recent evidence that they can also mediate their signals via GFR alpha receptors independently of Ret. The GDNF family of growth factors, unlike neurotrophins, has a well-defined function outside the nervous system. Recent transgenic and organ culture experiments have clearly demonstrated that GDNF is a mesenchyme-derived signaling molecule for the promotion of ureteric branching in kidney development. NTN, ART, and PSP are also expressed in the developing kidney, and NTN and PSP induce ureteric branching in vitro, but their true in vivo role in kidney morphogenesis is still unclear.
10704393	Depolarisation causes reciprocal changes in GFR(alpha)-1 and GFR(alpha)-2 receptor expression and shifts responsiveness to GDNF and neurturin in developing neurons.	GDNF and neurturin are structurally related neurotrophic factors that promote the survival of many different kinds of neurons and influence axonal and dendritic growth and synaptic function. These diverse effects are mediated via multicomponent receptors consisting of the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase plus one of two structurally related GPI-linked receptors, GFR(alpha)-1 and GFR(alpha)-2. To ascertain how the expression of these receptors is regulated during development, we cultured embryonic neurons under different experimental conditions and used competitive RT/PCR to measure the levels of the mRNAs encoding these receptors. We found that depolarising levels of KCl caused a marked increase in GFR(alpha)-1 mRNA and a marked decrease in GFR(&agr;)-2 mRNA in sympathetic, parasympathetic and sensory neurons. These changes were accompanied by increased responsiveness to GDNF and decreased responsiveness to neurturin, and were inhibited by L-type Ca(2+) channel antagonists, suggesting that they were due to elevated intracellular free-Ca(2+). There was no consistent effect of depolarising levels of KCl on ret mRNA expression, and neither GDNF nor neurturin significantly affected receptor expression. These results show that depolarisation has marked and opposing actions on the expression of GFR(&agr;)-1 and GFR(&agr;)-2, which are translated into corresponding changes in neuronal responsiveness to GDNF and neurturin. This provides evidence for a mechanism of regulating the neurotrophic factor responses of neurons by neural activity that has important implications for structural and functional plasticity in the developing nervous system.
11973622	Hirschsprung associated GDNF mutations do not prevent RET activation.	Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a complex disorder characterised by aganglia of distal gastrointestinal tracts. The highest proportion of both familial and sporadic cases is due to mutations of the RET proto-oncogene. Five germline mutations in the glial cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) gene, one of the RET ligands, have been detected in HSCR patients. Pedigrees analysis and the observed association between these GDNF alterations and RET variants in the same patients raised the question of whether the GDNF gene plays any causative/predisposing role in HSCR pathogenesis. In the present work, we have studied the ability of GDNF proteins, each bearing one of the reported mutations, to activate RET by performing a functional test in cultured neuroblastoma cells. Consistently with the lack of genotype/phenotype correlation in human subjects, our results indicate absence of detectable alterations of mutant GDNF induced RET activation.
8275421	Low rate of ret proto-oncogene activation (PTC/retTPC) in papillary thyroid carcinomas from Saudi Arabia.	BACKGROUND: The ret proto-oncogene activation (PTC/retTPC oncogene) in thyroid papillary carcinoma has been reported in different populations with different frequencies. Thyroid papillary carcinoma appears to behave more aggressively in the Persian Gulf region than elsewhere. In the current study, the frequency of PTC/retTPC oncogene in thyroid tumors from Saudi Arabia was investigated. METHODS: PTC/retTPC oncogene transcripts were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA synthesized by treatment of total RNA with reverse transcriptase. Seven multinodular goiters, 1 follicular adenoma, 4 follicular carcinomas, 40 papillary carcinomas, and 5 anaplastic carcinomas were studied. RESULTS: Only one papillary carcinoma specimen was found to have PTC/retTPC oncogene transcripts. The breakpoint of the rearranged PTC/retTPC oncogene is identical to that previously described. The PTC/retTPC-positive sample was also examined for p53 tumor suppressor gene mutations in exons 5-8. One transitional point mutation was detected at codon 161 (GCC to ACC), changing Ala to Thr. CONCLUSIONS: This study questions the relevance of PTC/retTPC oncogene in the carcinogenesis of thyroid papillary carcinomas in the Saudi population. Genetic background among races may contribute to the different frequencies of PTC/retTPC oncogene in thyroid papillary carcinoma.
8657307	Defects in enteric innervation and kidney development in mice lacking GDNF.	Glial-lial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been isolated as neurotrophic factor for midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Because of its neurotrophic activity on a wide range of neuronal populations in vitro and in vivo, GDNF is being considered as a potential therapeutic agent for neuronal disorders. During mammalian development, it is expressed not only in the nervous system, but also very prominently in the metanephric kidney and the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting possible functions during organogenesis. We have investigated the role of GDNF during development by generating a null mutation in the murine GDNF locus, and found that mutant mice show kidney agenesis or dysgenesis and defective enteric innervation. We demonstrate that GDNF induces ureter bud formation and branching during metanephros development, and is essential for proper innervation of the gastrointestinal tract.
9732293	The RET-glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) pathway stimulates migration and chemoattraction of epithelial cells.	Embryonic development requires cell migration in response to positional cues. Yet, how groups of cells recognize and translate positional information into morphogenetic movement remains poorly understood. In the developing kidney, the ureteric bud epithelium grows from the nephric duct towards a group of posterior intermediate mesodermal cells, the metanephric mesenchyme, and induces the formation of the adult kidney. The secreted protein GDNF and its receptor RET are required for ureteric bud outgrowth and subsequent branching. However, it is unclear whether the GDNF-RET pathway regulates cell migration, proliferation, survival, or chemotaxis. In this report, we have used the MDCK renal epithelial cell line to show that activation of the RET pathway results in increased cell motility, dissociation of cell adhesion, and the migration towards a localized source of GDNF. Cellular responses to RET activation include the formation of lamellipodia, filopodia, and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. These data demonstrate that GDNF is a chemoattractant for RET-expressing epithelial cells and thus account for the developmental defects observed in RET and GDNF mutant mice. Furthermore, the RET-transfected MDCK cells described in this report are a promising model for delineating RET signaling pathways in the renal epithelial cell lineage.
10444438	Lessons from genetically engineered animal models. II. Disorders of enteric neuronal development: insights from transgenic mice.	Understanding the development of congenital defects of the enteric nervous system, such as Hirschsprung's disease, was, until recently, an intractable problem. The analysis of transgenic mice, however, has now led to the discovery of a number of genetic abnormalities that give rise to aganglionic congenital megacolon or neuronal intestinal dysplasia. The identification of the responsible genes has enabled the developmental actions of their protein products to be investigated, which, in turn, has made it possible to determine the causes of aganglionoses. Two models of pathogenesis have emerged. One, associated with mutations in genes encoding endothelin-3 or its receptor, endothelin B, posits the premature differentiation of migrating neural crest-derived progenitors, causing the precursor pool to become depleted before the bowel has been fully colonized. The second, associated with mutations in genes encoding glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), its preferred receptor GFRalpha1, or their signaling component, Ret, appears to deprive a GDNF-dependent common progenitor of adequate support and/or mitogenic drive. In both cases, the terminal bowel becomes aganglionic when the number of colonizing neuronal precursors is inadequate.
10749116	Abnormal RNA expression of 11p15 imprinted genes and kidney developmental genes in Wilms' tumor.	Wilms' tumor (WT) is caused by abnormal development of embryonal kidney cells. WT cells are frequently affected by deletions or functional inactivation of maternal alleles at chromosome 11p15, which indicates that the loss of maternally expressed genes in this region plays an important role in WT pathogenesis. Maternally expressed genes indeed exist within an imprinted region at 11p15.5. Among these, BWR1C is highly expressed in fetal but not in adult kidney, which suggests that it may fulfil an important role in kidney development. Here, we demonstrate that the lack of BWR1C expression is common in WT. Its homology with the proapoptotic gene TDAG51 suggests that the loss of BWR1C expression may be relevant in WT development. In addition, the analysis of the expression of other 11p15 imprinted genes and kidney-developmentally regulated genes indicates that IGF2 overexpression, inappropriate coexpression of RET and GDNF and, in some cases, down-regulation of CDKN1C may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of WT. Our results add new elements to the understanding of the biological basis of WT, which may have implications for WT diagnosis and therapy.
8119964	The Wilms' tumor suppressor gene WT1 is negatively autoregulated.	The Wilms' tumor suppressor gene WT1 encodes a zinc-finger DNA-binding protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor. WT1 is expressed in a dramatic spatial and temporal pattern during kidney development and is thought to be critical during mesenchymal-epithelial conversion. The WT1 protein bound multiple sites in the WT1 promoter and functioned as a powerful transcriptional repressor of its gene in vivo (> 50-fold). The WT1 protein carrying an NH2-terminal 17-amino acid insertion and a 3-amino acid insertion (KTS) between zinc fingers 3 and 4, arising from the most abundant of four alternatively spliced transcripts, was the most powerful repressor. Of importance, a subset of WT1-binding sites differs from the Egr-1 consensus sequence, which has been shown to bind one splice variant of the WT1 protein (WT1(-KTS)). We characterized two of these sites and show that they bind both -KTS and +KTS forms of the WT1 zinc-finger protein and can confer repression on a heterologous promoter construct. Our data demonstrate that WT1, in addition to its known effects on insulin-like growth factor II, platelet-derived growth factor A, and Pax-2 transcription, is a powerful repressor of its own gene. These observations emphasize its critical role as a transcriptional regulatory protein during normal kidney development.
9240402	Differential regulation of mRNAs for GDNF and its receptors Ret and GDNFR alpha after sciatic nerve lesion in the mouse.	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), first characterized for its effect on dopamine uptake in central dopaminergic neurons, appears to be a powerful neurotrophic factor for motor neurons. GDNF has recently been shown to signal through a multisubunit receptor. This receptor is composed of a ligand-binding subunit, called GDNF receptor alpha (GDNFR alpha), and a signalling tyrosine kinase subunit, Ret. To gain further insight into GDNF function, we investigated the expression of GDNF and its receptors after nerve lesion in adult mice. Analysis of expression in muscle, nerve and spinal cord by RNase protection assay and in situ hydridization revealed that, in adult non-lesioned mice, GDNF mRNA was expressed in the nerve and GDNFR alpha mRNA in the nerve and the spinal cord, while the expression of Ret was restricted to spinal cord motor neurons. After a sciatic nerve crush a rapid increase in GDNF mRNA was observed in the distal part of the nerve and a delayed elevation in the muscle, while GDNFR alpha mRNA was up-regulated in the distal part of the sciatic nerve but not in proximal nerve or spinal cord. The lesion also induced a rapid increase in Ret mRNA expression, but the increase was observed only in spinal cord motor neurons and in dorsal root ganglion neurons. A pattern of expression of GDNF and its receptors similar to that seen after lesion in the adult was detected during embryonic development. Administration of GDNF enhanced sciatic nerve regeneration measured by the nerve pinch test. Taken together, these results suggest that GDNF has an important role during regeneration after nerve damage in the adult.
9881709	Genomic structure of the gene for the SH2 and pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein GRB10 and evaluation of its role in Hirschsprung disease.	Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), or congenital aganglionic megacolon, is the most frequent cause of congenital bowel obstruction. Germline mutations in the RET receptor tyrosine kinase have been shown to cause HSCR. Mice that carry null alleles for RET or for its ligand, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), both exhibit complete intestinal aganglionosis and renal defects. Recently, the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein Grb10 has been shown to interact with RET in vitro and in vivo, early in development. We have confirmed the map location of GRB10 on human chromosome 7, isolated human BACs containing the gene, elucidated its genomic structure, isolated a highly polymorphic microsatellite marker adjacent to exon 14 and scanned the gene for mutations in a large panel of HSCR patients. No evidence of linkage was detected in HSCR kindreds and no mutations were found in patients. These data suggest that while GRB10 may be important for signal transduction in developing embryos, it does not play an obvious role in HSCR.
10774729	GFRalpha-mediated localization of RET to lipid rafts is required for effective downstream signaling, differentiation, and neuronal survival.	The GDNF family ligands (GFLs: GDNF, neurturin, persephin, and artemin) signal through RET and a gly-cosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored coreceptor (GFRalpha1-alpha4) that binds ligand with high affinity and provides specificity. The importance of the GPI anchor is not fully understood; however, GPI-linked proteins cluster into lipid rafts, structures that may represent highly specialized signaling organelles. Here, we report that GPI-anchored GFRalpha1 recruits RET to lipid rafts after GDNF stimulation and results in RET/Src association. Disruption of RET localization using either transmembrane-anchored or soluble GFRalpha1 results in RET phosphorylation, but GDNF-induced intracellular signaling events are markedly attenuated as are neuronal differentiation and survival responses. Therefore, proper membrane localization of RET via interaction with a raft-localized, GPI-linked coreceptor is of fundamental importance in GFL signaling.
10809797	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is expressed in the human kidney and is a growth factor for human mesangial cells.	BACKGROUND: Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a recently cloned member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, is a potent neurotrophic factor in vitro and in vivo. GDNF is essential for nephrogenesis and the highest expression of GDNF is found in the developing kidney. Increased plasma GDNF levels have recently been documented in patients with chronic renal failure; the source and role of this increase, however, remain unclear. No data are available about the expression of GDNF in human adult kidney or human adult mesangial cell (HMC) cultures. We hypothesized that GDNF, similar to other members of the TGF-beta superfamily, might play a role as a growth factor in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis. METHODS: To address this hypothesis, we first investigated (by RT-PCR) the expression of GDNF mRNA and the mRNAs of the GDNF receptors Ret and GFRalpha-1 in (i) adult human renal cortex and medulla and (ii) in HMC in culture. The results were compared to the expression of these molecules in different developmental stages of the rat kidney. We found that both GDNF and its receptors were expressed in human adult kidney and HMC. Since this finding implicates a role for GDNF beyond nephrogenesis, i.e. in renal physiology/pathophysiology, we investigated the effect of GDNF on HMC growth, i.e. (i) cellular protein synthesis as an index of hypertrophy ([(3)H]methionine incorporation), (ii) DNA synthesis ([(3)H]thymidine incorporation) and cell proliferation (cell numbers) as indices of hyperplasia, and (iii) extracellular matrix synthesis, i.e. collagenous and non-collagenous extracellular proteins ([(3)H]proline incorporation into the collagenase-sensitive and -insensitive fraction). HMC cultures were used as a surrogate model for the development of glomerulosclerosis. RESULTS: GDNF induced a biphasic growth stimulatory effect in HMC with stimulation at the lowest concentration used (2 ng/ml) but had no effect at higher concentrations (20 and 50 ng/ml). In contrast, cellular protein synthesis and extracellular matrix synthesis were significantly and dose-dependently increased by GDNF. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that GDNF, similar to other members of the TGF-beta superfamily, might play a role as a growth factor for mesangial cells and might thus be a player in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis.
11018032	Determinants of ligand binding specificity in the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor alpha S.	The glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family comprise a subclass of cystine-knot superfamily ligands that interact with a multisubunit receptor complex formed by the c-Ret tyrosine kinase and a cystine-rich glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored binding subunit called GDNF family receptor alpha (GFRalpha). All four GDNF family ligands utilize c-Ret as a common signaling receptor, whereas specificity is conferred by differential binding to four distinct GFRalpha homologues. To understand how the different GFRalphas discriminate ligands, we have constructed a large set of chimeric and truncated receptors and analyzed their ligand binding and signaling capabilities. The major determinant of ligand binding was found in the most conserved region of the molecule, a central domain predicted to contain four conserved alpha helices and two beta strands. Distinct hydrophobic and positively charged residues in this central region were required for binding of GFRalpha1 to GDNF. Interaction of GFRalpha1 and GFRalpha2 with GDNF and neurturin required distinct subsegments within this central domain, which allowed the construction of chimeric receptors that responded equally well to both ligands. C-terminal segments adjacent to the central domain are necessary and have modulatory function in ligand binding. In contrast, the N-terminal domain was dispensable without compromising ligand binding specificity. Ligand-independent interaction with c-Ret also resides in the central domain of GFRalpha1, albeit within a distinct and smaller region than that required for ligand binding. Our results indicate that the central region of this class of receptors constitutes a novel binding domain for cystine-knot superfamily ligands.
9491986	Persephin, a novel neurotrophic factor related to GDNF and neurturin.	A novel neurotrophic factor named Persephin that is approximately 40% identical to glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NTN) has been identified using degenerate PCR. Persephin, like GDNF and NTN, promotes the survival of ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons in culture and prevents their degeneration after 6-hydroxydopamine treatment in vivo. Persephin also supports the survival of motor neurons in culture and in vivo after sciatic nerve axotomy and, like GDNF, promotes ureteric bud branching. However, in contrast to GDNF and NTN, persephin does not support any of the peripheral neurons that were examined. Fibroblasts transfected with Ret and one of the coreceptors GFRalpha-1 or GFRalpha-2 do not respond to persephin, suggesting that persephin utilizes additional, or different, receptor components than GDNF and NTN.
9804292	Developmental expression of GDNF, neurturin and their receptors in rat hippocampus.	GLIAL cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NTN) are members of a new family of factors within the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) super-family. Signaling by GDNF and NTN depends on the tyrosine kinase receptor Ret and on GFRalpha-1 and -2. We have investigated by competitive RT-PCR the developmental expression of these molecules within the rat hippocampus. All transcripts reach high expression levels between postnatal day 0 and 14 (P0-P14), a critical period of hippocampal differentiation, suggesting roles for these molecules in this process. All mRNAs (with the exception of Ret) can be detected as early as embryonic day 14 (E14). The absence of Ret expression at E14 suggests that both GDNF and NTN may employ an additional, unknown receptor. NTN expression shows a biphasic expression pattern, with maximum expression levels at E14 and P5.
10220148	Co-segregation of MEN2 and Hirschsprung's disease: the same mutation of RET with both gain and loss-of-function?	Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) and Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) are two dominantly inherited neurocristopathies ascribed to mutations in the RET gene [Chakravarti, 1996; Pasini et al., 1996; Eng and Mulligan, 1997]. MEN2 is a cancer syndrome comprising three related clinical subtypes: (1) MEN type 2A (MEN2A; MIM# 171400) characterized by the association of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma (Pheo), and hyperparathyroidism; (2) MEN type 2B (MEN2B; MIM# 162300), which includes MTC, Pheo, mucosal neuromas, ganglioneuromatosis of the digestive tract, and skeletal abnormalities; and (3) familial MTC (FMTC; MIM# 155240), defined by the sole occurrence of MTC. HSCR (MIM# 142623) is a congenital malformation caused by the absence of enteric plexuses in the hindgut, leading to bowel obstruction in neonates. The RET gene (MIM# 164761) codes for a transmembrane tyrosine kinase, a component of a multimeric complex that also comprises one of four members of a novel family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored receptor, GFRalpha((1-4) (e.g., GFRA1, MIM# 601496; references are detailed in Baloh et al. [1998]. Four structurally related soluble factors-glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neurturin, persephin, and artemin-are the ligands of these multimolecular receptors in which the nature of the GFRalpha determines the ligand specificity of the complex [see Baloh et al., 1998, for references]. It is well documented that RET/GFRalpha-1/GDNF delivers a signal critical for the survival of the early neural crest-derived precursors that colonize the intestine below the rostral foregut and give rise to the enteric nervous plexuses [Gershon, 1997; Cacalano et al., 1998; Enomoto et al., 1998].
10383048	GDNF family members and their receptors: expression and functions in two oligodendroglial cell lines representing distinct stages of oligodendroglial development.	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neurturin (NTN), and persephin (PSP) constitute a subfamily of transforming growth factor-betas (TGF-betas) with prominent roles in the regulation of neuron survival and differentiation. Although numerous members of the TGF-beta superfamily are important regulators of glial cell functions in health and disease, it is unknown whether any member of the GDNF subfamily may have functions in normal or pathological glial cell performances. To begin to address this issue, we have studied expression and putative functions of GDNF, NTN, PSP, and their receptors in two cell lines representing models for oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OLI-neu) and immature oligodendrocytes (OLN-93), respectively. RT-PCR analysis revealed expression of all three growth factor mRNAs in OLI-neu and OLN-93 cells. Expression was weak in OLI-neu cells, while both NTN and PSP mRNAs were strongly expressed in OLN-93 cells. Furthermore, OLI-neu and OLN-93 cells expressed transcripts encoding the GDNF receptors Ret and GFRalpha-1. The two splice variants for GFRalpha-2 were exclusively synthesized in OLI-neu cells. Similarly, primary O-2A progenitor cells and enriched mature oligodendrocytes expressed Ret, GFRalpha-1 and GFRalpha-2 mRNAs. Both GDNF and NTN stimulated DNA synthesis monitored by BrdU incorporation of OLI-neu cells in a dose-dependent fashion. Co-administration of TGF-beta significantly reduced this effect. Similarly, PDGF co-applied with GDNF or NTN down-regulated proliferation in OLI-neu cells. In contrast, OLN-93 cells did not respond to GDNF or NTN with increased incorporation of BrdU. Expression of GDNF, NTN, and their receptors and distinct effects in two model cell lines of oligodendrocyte development suggest that functions of members of the GDNF family and their receptors may not be restricted to neurons and may be implicated in oligodendrocyte development.
10516591	Expression of the GDNF receptors ret and GFRalpha1 in the developing avian enteric nervous system.	The formation of the enteric nervous system (ENS) from neural crest-derived cell precursors requires the growth factor glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and the receptors Ret and GDNF family receptor alpha 1 (GFRalpha1). We investigated the location(s), the timing, and the extent to which these GDNF receptors appear in the population of crest-derived precursors that form the avian ENS using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Sections and whole mounts of embryonic chick gastrointestinal tract were costained with antibodies to the receptors and to HNK-1, a marker for crest-derived cells. Neural crest-derived precursors migrate through the primitive esophagus to colonize the gizzard where an extensive cellular network forms. Ret-immunoreactivity (ir) was found in a network of cells in the gizzard at embryonic day (E)3.5. As development proceeded, Ret-immunoreactive cells appeared at progressively more caudal positions and were present in the colon at E7.5. Costaining with Ret and HNK-1 was performed to determine the number of Ret-immunoreactive cells in the crest-derived population. Ret appeared in some HNK-1 cells in the esophagus and gizzard at embryonic day (E)3.5. During development, the number of crest cells with Ret increased in the ganglia of the gizzard and small intestine. GFRalpha1-ir was also found in HNK-1 cells in the esophagus at E3.5 but did not appear in the gizzard until E4.5. Surprisingly, the colonizing vanguard of crest-derived cells lacked both Ret- and GFRalpha-ir. Between E4.5 and E6.5, the fraction of HNK-1-positive cells expressing GFRalpha1 increased considerably in the foregut. Ret and GFRalpha1 were coexpressed in many cells at E6.5, and the number of such cells increased as development progressed. In the adult, GFRalpha1 and Ret were found in the neuropil of enteric ganglia. We conclude that the population of cells expressing the receptors increases during development and persists in the adult, findings that support a neurotrophic role for GDNF in the formation and maintenance of the avian ENS.
11779046	RET(Men2B)-transgene produces sympathoadrenal tumors but does not prevent intestinal aganglionosis in gdnf-/- or gfr alpha-1(-/-) mice.	Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B) syndrome is caused by a missense mutation in the RET gene, which replaces Met918 by Thr in the intracellular kinase domain of the protein. This single amino acid substitution transforms the receptor into a constitutively active monomeric kinase (RET(Men2B)) and produces an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytomas, musculoskeletal anomalies, and mucosal ganglioneuromas. The ligand, GDNF, stimulates RET activity through a co-receptor, GFR alpha-1. In vitro studies have shown that the kinase and mitogenic properties of RET(Men2B) are enhanced by GDNF/GFR alpha-1 stimulation. A relevant clinical question is whether ablation of either GDNF or GFR alpha-1 could alter penetrance or severity of the MEN2B syndrome. We report that ganglioneuromatous tumors caused by a RET(Men2B) transgene in mice are not affected grossly or microscopically by the absence of gdnf or gfr alpha-1. Loss-of-function mutations in ret, gdnf, or gfr alpha-1 cause pan-intestinal aganglionosis in mice. We find that expression of the RET(Men2B) transgene in enteric neural progenitors, after they colonize the gut, does not prevent intestinal aganglionosis associated with gdnf or gfr alpha-1 deficiency.
12107109	Characterization of gene expression induced by RET with MEN2A or MEN2B mutation.	Germ-line point mutations of the RET gene are responsible for multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2A and 2B that develop medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma. We performed a differential display analysis of gene expression using NIH 3T3 cells expressing the RET-MEN2A or RET-MEN2B mutant proteins. As a consequence, we identified 10 genes induced by both mutant proteins and eight genes repressed by them. The inducible genes include cyclin D1, cathepsins B and L, and cofilin genes that are known to be involved in cell growth, tumor progression, and invasion. In contrast, the repressed genes include type I collagen, lysyl oxidase, annexin I, and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) genes that have been implicated in tumor suppression. In addition, six RET-MEN2A- and five RET-MEN2B-inducible genes were identified. Among 21 genes induced by RET-MEN2A and/or RET-MEN2B, six genes including cyclin D1, cathepsin B, cofilin, ring finger protein 11 (RNF11), integrin-alpha6, and stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) genes were also induced in TGW human neuroblastoma cells in response to glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor stimulation. Because the STC1 gene was found to be highly induced by both RET-MEN2B and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor stimulation, and the expression of its product was detected in medullary thyroid carcinoma with the MEN2B mutation by immunohistochemistry, this may suggest a possible role for STC1 in the development of MEN 2B phenotype.
11319768	Differential regulation of GDNF, neurturin, and their receptors in primary cultures of rat glial cells.	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NTN) bind to GFR alpha-1 and GFR alpha-2 receptors, respectively, and their neurotrophic activity is mediated by the tyrosine kinase receptor, Ret. All these molecules were found to be expressed in primary cultures of rat glial cells, which were largely composed of astrocytes and maintained in serum-free medium. Although GDNF, NTN and Ret mRNA levels were at the limit of detection, RNase protection assays revealed relatively high amounts of GFR alpha-1 and GFR alpha transcripts. To characterize signals controlling their expression, glial cells were exposed to serum or treated with hormones acting through nuclear receptors and by activators of the cAMP or protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathways. Retinoic acid or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 appeared ineffective. In contrast, the 5-fold increase in GFR alpha-2 mRNA after 24 hr of treatment with 10(-10) M of tri-iodothyronine, suggests a physiological role of thyroid hormone in the regulation of this receptor in vivo. The serum induced a 7-fold increase in GFR alpha-1 mRNA levels. These changes may be mediated by the cAMP or PKC pathways because both forskolin and TPA up-regulated the GFR alpha-1 gene. Interestingly, only TPA led to a coordinated increase in the levels of GDNF, GFR alpha-1 and GFR alpha-2 mRNAs. On the other hand, NTN transcripts remained constant, irrespective of the culture conditions. Taken together, these results indicate that GDNF family ligands and their receptors are regulated in glial cells by common or independent transductional pathways, which could modulate their specific expression during brain development or in the case of trauma.
12358785	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor up-regulates the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase gene in human neuroblastoma cell lines.	The role of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in the survival of dopaminergic neurons has been well documented, but its effect on dopamine biosynthesis remains to be elucidated. In this study, the effect of GDNF on the gene expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme of dopamine biosynthesis, was investigated. We found that GDNF elevated the expression of the TH gene at both mRNA and protein levels in TGW cells, a human neuroblastoma cell line. GDNF significantly enhances the transcription rate of the TH gene as actinomycin D prevented the induction of TH mRNA and GDNF increased the activity of the TH promoter. In addition, GDNF exerts a relatively weak but significant effect on the stability of TH mRNA, because GDNF delayed the degradation of TH mRNA and strengthened a special TH mRNA/protein interaction known to be relevant with TH mRNA stability. By comparing several human neurogenic cell lines, we found that GDNF-induced TH expression was only observed in the cells possessing Ret protein and coincided with the expression levels. Taken together, these results indicate that GDNF up-regulates the expression of the TH gene by promoting the transcription of the TH gene and the stability of TH mRNA with the Ret receptor dependency in some neuroblastoma cell lines. Thus, GDNF exerts its neurotrophic role not only in promoting cells survival, but also in affecting dopamine biosynthesis.
8057440	Lack of correlation between basal expression levels and susceptibility to transcriptional shutdown among single-gene murine leukemia virus vector proviruses.	Integrated retroviruses or retroviral vectors may be transcriptionally inactive although their promoter-enhancer regions are able to direct transcription in the host cell. We have used single-gene retroviral vectors with a long terminal repeat-directed neo marker gene to determine if the level of transcription relates to the susceptibility of a provirus to inactivation. We used two isogenic vectors, carrying long terminal repeats with a strong and a weak transcriptional enhancer derived from SL3-3 and Akv murine leukemia viruses, respectively. Nonselected cell clones of the murine lymphoid cell line L691 with single integrated vector proviruses exhibiting a 20-fold range of initial expression levels were studied. The basal expression level of a given cell clone with a single provirus did not show any pattern of correlation with the long-term stability of expression, as monitored for periods up to 150 days. Our results thus indicate that the inactivation mechanism operates independently of the initial transcriptional activity of the provirus.
8896568	Germline mutations in glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and RET in a Hirschsprung disease patient.	Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), or congenital aganglionic megacolon, is the most common cause of congenital bowel obstruction with an incidence of 1 in 5000 live births. HSCR may be inherited as a single gene disorder with reduced penetrance or as a multigenic trait. HSCR mutations have been identified in the RET receptor tyrosine kinase, endothelin-B receptor (EDNRB) and its physiological ligand, endothelin 3 (EDN3). Although RET's ligand has remained elusive, it is expected to be an extracellular neurotrophic molecule expressed in the developing gut and kidney mesenchyme, based on the phenotypes of intestinal aganglionosis and renal agenesis observed in homozygous RET knockout (Ret -/-) mice. The glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is such a molecule. Recently, mice carrying two null alleles for Gdnf were shown to exhibit phenotypes remarkably similar to Ret-/- animals. We screened 106 unrelated HSCR patients for mutations in GDNF by direct sequencing. We identified one familial mutation in a HSCR patient with a known de novo RET mutation and malrotation of the gut. No haplotype sharing was evident in any of 36 HSCR kindreds typed for microsatellite markers surrounding GDNF on human chromosome 5p. Our data suggest that GDNF is a minor contributor to human HSCR susceptibility and that loss of its function in enteric neurogenesis may be compensated for by other neurotrophic factors or via other pathways. However, it may be that in rare instances, RET and GDNF mutations act in concert to produce an enteric phenotype.
9527540	Localization of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha and c-ret mRNA in rat central nervous system.	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a neurotrophic factor that influences the survival and function of several neuronal populations in the central (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems. The actions of GDNF are mediated by a multicomponent receptor complex composed of the tyrosine kinase product of c-ret and the ligand-binding protein GDNF receptor alpha (GDNFR-alpha). In the present study, we used in situ hybridization to localize cells expressing the mRNA for these GDNF receptor subunits in rat CNS. As reported previously, GDNFR-alpha and c-ret mRNA are present in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, regions containing GDNF-responsive dopamine neurons. However, both mRNA were found in motor neurons of spinal cord and brainstem nuclei that innervate skeletal muscle. These areas include alpha motor neurons in the ventral horn of spinal cord and neurons in hypoglossal, facial, trigeminal, and abducens nuclei. In areas rostral to the substantia nigra, c-ret mRNA is not detected, whereas GDNFR-alpha is found in numerous brain structures, including the hippocampus, cortex, medial geniculate, and the medial habenula, the latter area expressing the highest levels of GDNFR-alpha mRNA in brain. These results provide evidence that c-ret and GDNFR-alpha mRNA are expressed in neuronal populations involved in motor function and provides further support for GDNF as a target-derived neurotrophic for these motor neurons. The observation that GDNFR-alpha mRNA is localized in several brain structures that do not contain detectable levels of c-ret mRNA indicates that either GDNFR-alpha utilizes signal transduction molecules other than c-ret in these areas or that other GDNF-like ligands that utilize GDNFR-alpha as a receptor may be present.
9613719	A preclinical development strategy designed to optimize the use of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.	GDNF is a pleitropic neurotrophic factor which stimulates the dopaminergic phenotype in vitro and in vivo by way of activation of the GDNF/RET receptor complex. The pharmacologic profile of GDNF in two well-characterized animal models of Parkinson's disease suggests that the molecule may be useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases involving dopaminergic dysfunction such as Parkinson's disease. This review summarizes the preclinical development path which was taken to develop GDNF as a novel therapeutic approach to treat Parkinson's disease based on GDNF's ability to regenerate dopamine neurons, including a description of the pharmacologic/biologic activities of GDNF. The overall aim will be to discuss these issues in the context of their potential therapeutic usefulness of GDNF to treat Parkinson's disease.
9620546	Full activation of MEN2B mutant RET by an additional MEN2A mutation or by ligand GDNF stimulation.	Germline mutations of RET gene, encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase, have been associated with the MEN2A and MEN2B inherited cancer syndromes. In MEN2A mutations affecting cysteine residues in the extracellular domain of the receptor cause constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase by the formation of disulfide-bonded homodimers. In MEN2B a single mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain (Met918Thr) has been identified. This mutation does not lead to dimer formation, but has been shown (both biologically and biochemically) to cause ligand-independent activation of the Ret protein, but to a lesser extent than MEN2A mutations. Intramolecular activation by cis-autophosphorylation of RetMEN2B monomers has been proposed as a model for activation, although alternative mechanisms can be envisaged. Here we show that the activity of RetMEN2B can be increased by stable dimerization of the receptor. Dimerization was achieved experimentally by constructing a double mutant receptor with a MEN2A mutation (Cys634Arg) in addition to the MEN2B mutation, and by chronic exposure of RetMEN2B-expressing cells to the Ret ligand GDNF. In both cases full activation of RetMEN2B, measured by 'in vitro' transfection assays and biochemical parameters, was seen. These results indicate that the MEN2B phenotype could be influenced by the tissue distribution or concentration of Ret ligand(s).
9721987	Mutational analysis of the endothelin-B receptor gene in Japanese Hirschsprung's disease.	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Hirschsprung's disease (HD, HSCR) is one of the most common diseases in the field of pediatric surgery. It is well known that the aganglionic bowel is primarily a causative factor of dismotility of distal narrow segment. Recent studies have shown that mutations in endothelin-B receptor (EDNRB), endothelin-3, RET, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) genes are responsible for the occurrence of congenital aganglionosis. Here, the authors describe two new mutations of the EDNRB gene in Japanese patients with HD. RESULTS: One patient had a heterozygous point mutation at the splice donor site of intron 3, leading to premature termination of translation of EDNRB mRNA. Another patient has a heterozygous missense mutation (N1041) in exon 1, but the same mutation was found in two of 50 normal individuals, so the mutation may be a noncausative polymorphism of the EDNRB gene. CONCLUSION: These results provide further evidence that a spectrum of different mutations within the EDNRB gene are responsible for HD.
11786211	Expression of Ret receptor tyrosine kinase after transient forebrain ischemia is modulated by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor in rat hippocampus.	The Ret receptor tyrosine kinase is part of a functional receptor complex for the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family. We examined the expression of Ret mRNA after transient forebrain ischemia, and explored the effect of local GDNF-pretreatment in rat hippocampus on Ret mRNA expression. Transient forebrain ischemia induced Ret mRNA expression in the hippocampus, with a peak effect at 12 h. Whereas intrahippocampal microinjection of GDNF (1.0 microg) in sham-operated rats induced the expression of Ret mRNA (peak at 6 to 12 h), the expected increase of Ret mRNA induced by ischemia was blunted by local GDNF-pretreatment. Immunohistochemical investigation revealed that ischemia-induced Ret receptor expression in the hippocampal CA1 region was also reduced by local GDNF-pretreatment. These findings suggest that GDNF modulates the expression of Ret, and that GDNF signaling pathways that involve the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase might play an important role in brain injury induced by ischemia.
8139849	[Familial ovarian cancer syndrome].	This paper gives an overview of the familial ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer prone families defined as two or more first or second degree relatives with ovarian cancer, are of clinical importance because first or second degree family members of affected women are at risk of developing ovarian cancer. These women need surveillance including prophylactic oophorectomy in those with increased risk. Women with hereditary ovarian cancer are at the greatest risk. Familial ovarian cancer studies are also important in terms of research. They provide the best hope of identifying a gene involved in the genesis of ovarian cancer. There is good evidence that such a gene is likely to be involved in the development of non-familial ovarian cancer as well. This might be a clue to understanding the biology of ovarian cancer. Therefore ovarian cancer prone families should be identified and, since familial ovarian cancer is rare, available details about affected and non-affected family members should be registered at least at national level. The author set up the Hungarian Registry for familial ovarian carcinoma at the National Institute of Oncology Budapest.
8933332	Mutation analysis of the BRCA1 gene in 23 families with cases of cancer of the breast, ovary, and multiple other sites.	Germline mutations in the BRCA1 tumour suppressor gene on chromosome 17q21 are responsible for approximately half of the cases of hereditary breast cancer, including the majority of familial breast/ovarian cancers. To increase our knowledge of the spectrum of BRCA1 mutations, we have extended our analysis to include patients with varied family histories of cancer of the breast, ovary, and at multiple other sites. We have analysed 23 unrelated familial cases using direct sequencing or a combination of dideoxy fingerprinting and sequencing procedures. Twenty one of these families contained three or more cases of breast or ovarian cancer and two families had one case of breast cancer diagnosed before the age of 40 and one case of ovarian cancer. The common frameshift mutation 5382insC was detected in two patients, and the 185delAG mutation was found in a family of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. The novel frameshift mutation 3450del4 (CAAG) was detected in a patient who developed breast cancer at the age of 28 and ovarian cancer at the age of 34. Three other women in this family were diagnosed with breast cancer at the ages of 26, 29, and 40. The novel framshift mutation 2953del3+C was found in a French Canadian woman who had developed two primary cancers of the breast at the age of 37 and 38 and renal cancer at the age of 38.
8946903	High frequency of BRCA1 185delAG mutation in ovarian cancer in Israel. National Israel Study of Ovarian Cancer.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of BRCA1 185delAG mutation in ovarian carcinogenesis. DESIGN: Genetic testing of a subset of cases from an ongoing study of ovarian cancer and of controls. SETTING: A community-based case-control incidence study. SUBJECTS: Seventy-nine patients with ovarian cancer, 62 hospitalized women without cancer (controls), and 120 healthy women participating in a fragile X screening program (also controls), examined for the presence of germline BRCA1 185delAG mutation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Polymerase chain reaction-amplified BRCA1 exon 2 fragments generated from patients' and controls' blood samples, analyzed by heteroduplex gel shift assay and direct sequence analyses. RESULTS: The 185delAG mutation was detected in 38.9% (7/18) of ovarian cancer patients with familial history, and 13.1% (8/61) of family history-negative ovarian cancer cases. Only 1 carrier was detected among the 120 healthy controls, and none in the hospital controls. A significant difference in mutation carrier rates between family history-negative cases and control groups of 120 and 62 subjects was identified (Fisher exact test, P=.001 and P=.003, respectively). The median age (+/-SE) at disease diagnosis was lower among both familial and family history-negative mutation carriers, as compared with mutation-negative, family history-negative cases--50 (+/-1.4) vs 60.5 (+/-3.5) years old, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.94-3.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data are preliminary but suggest that BRCA1 185delAG germline mutation is frequent in Israeli ovarian cancer patients, irrespective of family history, and may confer an early-onset phenotype of ovarian cancer
8968716	BRCA1 R841W: a strong candidate for a common mutation with moderate phenotype.	BRCA1 mutations cause increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer, frequently of early onset. Many different mutations occur in BRCA1, including several examples of recurrent mutations, each of which accounts for a significant number of families with heritable cancer predisposition. These common mutations have an etiological role in many breast and ovarian cancer cases and provide the opportunity to examine genotype-phenotype correlations and genotype-environment interactions in individuals with the identical BRCA1 lesion. We report a novel missense change in BRCA1, 2640 C-->T (R841W), found in 3 cases from a subject group of 305 breast and 79 ovarian cancer cases from Orange County, CA. These are consecutive, population-based cases not selected for age or family history. In all three cases, there is a strong family history of breast, ovarian, or other cancers possibly related to a BRCA1 defect and family members showed a high concordance of cancer incidence with the presence of R841W. The age of cancer onset was not always distinct from typical sporadic cases. Testing of a sample of 413 unrelated individuals to examine the hypothesis that R841W might be a rare polymorphism detected one additional instance in a woman with breast cancer diagnosed at age 77 years, and cancer in one parent. R841W is likely to be an etiologically significant lesion with involvement in close to 1% (95% confidence interval of 0-1.7%) of all breast and ovarian cancers in this population.
8990217	Direct detection of mutations in the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis.	The tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, which confer increased susceptibility to breast and (or) ovarian cancer, were recently identified. Mutation analysis of BRCA1 has demonstrated significant allelic heterogeneity; however, some distinct mutations have been detected in unrelated individuals. The most notable is the 185delAG mutation, which occurs at an estimated frequency of approximately 1% in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent [1]. Although consensus has not been reached regarding clinical testing for mutations in BRCA1, a tiered strategy may be appropriate, in which direct testing for the more common mutations is one component. Specific alleles can be detected by using PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis (PSM), which alters the PCR products derived from either the wild-type or mutant allele to create or destroy a restriction endonuclease recognition site. Recognition sites are introduced by a base substitution in one of the primers. The alleles are then resolved by electrophoresis of the digested PCR products. We have applied this technique to the detection of four BRCA1 mutations: 185delAG, 5382insC, E1250X, and R1443X. Another mutation, 1294de140, can be resolved from the wild-type allele by high-resolution gel electrophoresis alone. The PSM technique is sensitive, does not require radioactivity, and is specific for individual mutations.
9042909	The founder mutations 185delAG and 5382insC in BRCA1 and 6174delT in BRCA2 appear in 60% of ovarian cancer and 30% of early-onset breast cancer patients among Ashkenazi women.	The mutations 185delAG, 188del11, and 5382insC in the BRCA1 gene and 6174delT in the BRCA2 gene were analyzed in 199 Ashkenazi and 44 non-Ashkenazi Jewish unrelated patients with breast and/or ovarian cancer. Of the Jewish Ashkenazi women with ovarian cancer, 62% (13/21) had one of the target mutations, as did 30% (13/43) of women with breast cancer alone diagnosed before the age 40 years and 10% (15/141) of those with breast cancer diagnosed after the age 40 years. Age at ovarian cancer diagnosis was not associated with carrier status. Of 99 Ashkenazi patients with no family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer, 10% carried one of the mutations; in two of them the mutation was proved to be paternally transmitted. One non-Ashkenazi Jewish ovarian cancer patient from Iraq carried the 185delAG mutation. Individual mutation frequencies among breast cancer Ashkenazi patients were 6.7% for 185delAG, 2.2% for 5382insC, and 4.5% for 6174delT, among ovarian cancer patients; 185delAG and 6174delT were about equally common (33% and 29%, respectively), but no ovarian cancer patient carried the 5382insC. More mutations responsible for inherited breast and ovarian cancer probably remain to be found in this population, since 79% of high-incidence breast cancer families and 35% of high-incidence breast/ovarian cancer families had none of the three known founder mutations.
9150153	Founder BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Ashkenazi Jews in Israel: frequency and differential penetrance in ovarian cancer and in breast-ovarian cancer families.	Germ-line BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations account for most of familial breast-ovarian cancer. In Ashkenazi Jews, there is a high population frequency (approximately 2%) of three founder mutations: BRCA1 185delAG, BRCA1 5382insC, and BRCA2 6174delT. This study examined the frequency of these mutations in a series of Ashkenazi women with ovarian cancer unselected for family history, compared with the frequency of these mutations in families ascertained on the basis of family history of at least two affected women. Penetrance was compared, both according to the method of family ascertainment (i.e., on the basis of an unselected ovarian cancer proband vs. on the basis of family history) and for the BRCA1 founder mutations compared with the BRCA2 6174delT mutation. There was a high frequency (10/22; [45%]) of germ-line mutations in Ashkenazi women with ovarian cancer, even in those with minimal or no family history (7/18 [39%]). In high-risk Ashkenazi families, a founder mutation was found in 59% (25/42). Families with any case of ovarian cancer were significantly more likely to segregate a founder mutation than were families with site-specific breast cancer. Penetrance was higher in families ascertained on the basis of family history than in families ascertained on the basis of an unselected proband, but this difference was not significant. Penetrance of BRCA1 185delAG and BRCA1 5382insC was significantly higher than penetrance of BRCA2 6174delT (hazard ratio 2.1 [95% CI 1.2-3.8]; two-tailed P = .01). Thus, the high rate of germ-line BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations in Ashkenazi women and families with ovarian cancer is coupled with penetrance that is lower than previously estimated. This has been shown specifically for the BRCA2 6174delT mutation, but, because of ascertainment bias, it also may be true for BRCA1 mutations.
9450858	Is hereditary site-specific ovarian cancer a distinct genetic condition?	It is not clear if hereditary site-specific ovarian cancer exists as a genetic entity distinct from the hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome. We have identified a large Ashkenazi Jewish kindred with 8 cases of ovarian carcinoma and no cases of breast cancer. Initially, linkage analysis for this kindred generated a negative LOD score to BRCA1, but subsequent mutation and haplotype analysis of key individuals demonstrated a BRCA1 185delAG mutation segregating with all but 1 of the ovarian cancer cases. This observation has important implications for genetic counselling of families with site-specific ovarian cancer. Hereditary site-specific ovarian cancer is likely to be a variant of the hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome, attributable to either BRCA1 or BRCA2. We consider women from these families to be at increased risk of breast cancer and counsel them accordingly.
9536083	The 185delAG BRCA1 mutation originated before the dispersion of Jews in the diaspora and is not limited to Ashkenazim.	The 185delAG mutation in BRCA1 is detected in Ashkenazi Jews both in familial breast and ovarian cancer and in the general population. All tested Ashkenazi mutation carriers share the same allelic pattern at the BRCA1 locus. Our previous study showed that this 'Ashkenazi' mutation also occurs in Iraqi Jews with a similar allelic pattern. We extended our analysis to other non-Ashkenazi subsets: 354 of Moroccan origin, 200 Yemenites and 150 Iranian Jews. Heteroduplex analysis complemented by direct DNA sequencing of abnormally migrating bands were employed. Four of Moroccan origin (1. 1%) and none of the Yemenites or Iranians was a carrier of the 185delAG mutation. BRCA1 allelic patterns were determined for four of these individuals and for 12 additional non-Ashkenazi 185delAG mutation carriers who had breast/ovarian cancer. Six non-Ashkenazi individuals shared the common 'Ashkenazi haplotype', four had a closely related pattern, and the rest ( n = 6) displayed a distinct BRCA1 allelic pattern. We conclude that the 185delAG BRCA1 mutation occurs in some non-Ashkenazi populations at rates comparable with that of Ashkenazim. The majority of Jewish 185delAG mutation carriers have a common allelic pattern, supporting the founder effect notion, but dating the mutation's origin to an earlier date than currently estimated. However, the different allelic pattern at the BRCA1 locus even in some Jewish mutation carriers, might suggest that the mutation arose independently.
9665148	Rates of Jewish ancestral mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in borderline ovarian tumors.	BACKGROUND: Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are known to be associated with an increased risk of breast and epithelial ovarian cancers. Two specific mutations, 185delAG-BRCA1 and 6174delT-BRCA2, have been detected in a substantial proportion (20%-60%) of unselected Ashkenazi Jewish patients--i.e., Jewish patients of Eastern/Northern European descent--with invasive ovarian cancer and in a measurable proportion (2%) of the general Ashkenazi Jewish population. However, uncertainty exists concerning the heritable basis of borderline ovarian tumors and whether these tumors represent an early form of ultimately invasive disease. To gain insight into these issues, we determined the rates of 185delAG-BRCA1 and 6174delT-BRCA2 mutations in patients with borderline ovarian tumors. METHODS: Analysis of 185delAG-BRCA1 and 6174delT-BRCA2 germline mutations was performed by use of a heteroduplex formation assay in samples from 46 consecutive patients with borderline ovarian tumors and 59 consecutive patients with invasive epithelial ovarian cancers. Forty-eight samples were also analyzed by restriction enzyme analysis for the presence of the 5382insC-BRCA1 mutation, a mutation detected in 2.2% of Ashkenazi Jewish patients with breast, but not ovarian, cancer. RESULTS: One (2.2%) of the 46 patient with borderline tumors was identified as a carrier of the 185delAG-BRCA1 mutation, and no patients were found to carry the 6174delT-BRCA2 mutation. Nineteen (32%) of the 59 patients with invasive ovarian cancer were found to carry one of these two mutations; 17 carried 185delAG-BRCA1 and two carried 6174delT-BRCA2 (chi2 test with continuity correction, P = .00028). None of the patients analyzed for 5382insC-BRCA1 were found to carry the mutation. In one high-risk family that included 185delAG-BRCA1 carriers, a single patient with stage IIIc borderline ovarian tumor did not carry the mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive epithelial and borderline ovarian tumors appear to differ in their genetic predisposition and in the molecular mechanisms underlying their genesis.
10188893	Characteristics of small breast and/or ovarian cancer families with germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2.	For families with a small number of cases of breast and/or ovarian cancer, limited data are available to predict the likelihood of genetic predisposition due to mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. In 104 families with three or more affected individuals (average 3.8) seeking counselling at family cancer clinics, mutation analysis was performed in the open reading frame of BRCA1 and BRCA2 by the protein truncation test and mutation-specific assays. In 31 of the 104 families tested, mutations were detected (30%). The majority of these mutations (25) occurred in BRCA1. Mutations were detected in 15 out of 25 families (60%) with both breast and ovarian cancer and in 16 out of 79 families (20%) with exclusively cases of breast cancer. Thus, an ovarian cancer case strongly predicted finding a mutation (P < 0.001). Within the group of small breast-cancer-only families, a bilateral breast cancer case or a unilateral breast cancer case diagnosed before age 40 independently predicted finding a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (P = 0.005 and P = 0.02, respectively). Therefore, even small breast/ovarian cancer families with at least one case of ovarian cancer, bilateral breast cancer, or a case of breast cancer diagnosed before age 40, should be referred for mutation screening.
10198641	Centrosome amplification and a defective G2-M cell cycle checkpoint induce genetic instability in BRCA1 exon 11 isoform-deficient cells.	Germline mutations of the Brca1 tumor suppressor gene predispose women to breast and ovarian cancers. To study mechanisms underlying BRCA1-related tumorigenesis, we derived mouse embryonic fibroblast cells carrying a targeted deletion of exon 11 of the Brca1 gene. We show that the mutant cells maintain an intact G1-S cell cycle checkpoint and proliferate poorly. However, a defective G2-M checkpoint in these cells is accompanied by extensive chromosomal abnormalities. Mutant fibroblasts contain multiple, functional centrosomes, which lead to unequal chromosome segregation, abnormal nuclear division, and aneuploidy. These data uncover an essential role of BRCA1 in maintaining genetic stability through the regulation of centrosome duplication and the G2-M checkpoint and provide a molecular basis for the role of BRCA1 in tumorigenesis.
10200350	Systematic sequencing of the BRCA-1 coding region for germ-line mutation detection in 70 French high-risk families.	Seventy French high-risk families were screened for germ-line BRCA-1 mutations. The BRCA-1 coding region and the exon-intron boundaries were sequenced, except when pre-screening by PTT revealed a truncated protein in exon 11. Germ-line BRCA-1 mutations were detected in 24% of families. The number of breast and ovarian cancers per family, a relative young age at ovarian cancer diagnosis, and the occurrence of breast and ovarian cancer in the same patient significantly predicted the presence of a BRCA-1 mutation. The low BRCA-1 mutation frequency suggested that some alterations were not detected and some families were probably BRCA-2 or BRCAx carriers.
10203660	Peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma, a phenotypic variant of familial ovarian cancer: implications for ovarian cancer screening.	OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to report the cancers arising during a familial ovarian cancer screening program and investigate the tumor's clonality and association with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. STUDY DESIGN: Program participants with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer or peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma were identified and their demographic characteristics, ultrasonographic findings, CA 125 results, operative reports, and pathology slides reviewed. Immunohistochemical analysis of p53, bcl-2, HER-2/neu, and nm23 H1 expression was performed on tumor tissues from multiple metastatic sites, and germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were identified. RESULTS: Three stage I ovarian cancers and 7 cases of peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma were diagnosed from among 1261 program participants. Ultrasonographic abnormalities triggered surgical exploration in all 3 cases of stage I disease. Elevated levels of CA 125 were the harbinger in 2 of 7 cases of peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma, abnormal ultrasonographic findings prompted diagnosis in 2 of 7 cases, and 3 of 7 women had abdominal symptoms 5, 6, and 16 months after screening. Results of immunohistochemical studies suggested multifocal disease in 5 of 7 patients with peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma. At least 3 of the patients with peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma carry BRCA1 185delAG mutations. CONCLUSION: Multifocal peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma may be a phenotypic variant of familial ovarian cancer, and screening strategies for these women cannot rely on ultrasonography and CA 125 testing to detect early disease.
10739701	Establishment and characterization of a breast cell strain containing a BRCA1 185delAG mutation.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine whether cells containing the heterozygous form of a BRCA1 185delAG mutation would exhibit abnormal growth or an altered response to DNA damage. METHODS: A primary culture of human mammary epithelial cells (90P) was obtained from the nontumor breast tissue of a 35-year-old patient who had undergone a mastectomy for removal of a breast tumor. These cells were immortalized (90PE6E7) following retroviral infection with HPV-16 viral E6/E7. genes. Both the 90P cell strain and the cell line were characterized for their ability to grow in culture, form colonies in soft agar, and produce tumors in athymic nude mice compared to normal breast epithelial cells containing wild-type BRCA1. 90P cells were also analyzed for cellular response to gamma radiation and H(2)O(2). RESULTS: These cells were confirmed to contain a frameshift mutation, 185delAG, of the BRCA1 gene. Despite being heterozygous for wild-type BRCA1, the 220-kDa full-size BRCA1 protein was abundantly expressed. 90P and 90PE6E7 cells grew at a similar rate and were anchorage dependent. 90PE6E7 also failed to form tumors in athymic nude mice. Finally, 90P cells exhibited a survival response similar to that of normal mammary epithelial cells to radiation damage and exposure to oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge the 90P cells and the 90PE6E7 cells are the first characterized, non-tumor-derived breast epithelial cells that are heterozygous for the BRCA1 germline mutation 185delAG. Our conclusion is that these BRCA1 mutant cells appear to have growth and stress response characteristics similar to those of normal human breast cells, which is consistent with the hypothesis that loss of heterozygosity must occur to impair putative BRCA1 function.
11334729	The BRCA1 syndrome and other inherited breast or breast-ovarian cancers in a Norwegian prospective series.	Inherited breast cancer is a heterogenous group of diseases. We examined this heterogeneity in a prospective series of inherited breast and ovarian cancers, previously demonstrated to include 84% of inherited cancers. Ninety-two tumours (65 breast and 27 ovarian) in 82 patients from 70 kindreds were prospectively diagnosed. Fifteen of the breast cancers were in situ, 50 were infiltrating. 40 (49%) of the 82 women carried a BRCA1 mutation, whereas no mutation in BRCA2 was found. Approximately, two-thirds of the BRCA1 mutation carriers had one of the four most frequent Norwegian founder mutations. Ninety-five per cent of the epithelial ovarian cancers occurred in BRCA1 mutation carrying women versus 38% of infiltrating breast cancers and 7% of carcinoma in situ of the breast. The BRCA1 syndrome was phenotypically distinct with invasive, high grade, oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancers and epithelial ovarian cancers. Non-BRCA1/2 inherited breast cancers included carcinoma in situ and lobular carcinoma and were frequently bilateral. Non-BRCA1/2 inherited breast cancer is not associated with epithelial ovarian cancer and in breast cancers has distinct biological characteristics, indicating that the different subgroups of inherited breast cancer may need different healthcare services.
11451557	Three primary malignancies related to BRCA mutation successively occurring in a BRCA1 185delAG mutation carrier.	The 185delAG and 5382insC mutations in the BRCA1 gene and the 6174delT mutation in the BRCA2 gene (the Ashkenazi mutations) have been found to be significantly more common among Jews of eastern European ancestry (1 in 40, 2.5%) in comparison to the general population (1 in 800 to 1 in 300, 0.12-0.33%). Carriers of these mutations, especially the BRCA1 185delAG mutation, have a significantly increased lifetime risk of breast and ovarian carcinoma and other carcinomas as compared to non-carriers. A case of three primary malignancies related to the BRCA1 185delAG mutation successively occurring in a carrier of this mutation, is described. The patient successively developed breast carcinoma, ovarian micropapillary serous carcinoma and peritoneal papillary serous carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining results have indicated that these tumors are three separate primary malignancies. This case illustrates that ovarian serous borderline tumors (including micropapillary serous carcinoma) and peritoneal papillary serous carcinomas should be considered, like breast and ovarian carcinomas, tumors expressed in BRCA mutation carriers.
11975969	Transitional cell ovarian carcinoma in a BRCA1 mutation carrier.	BACKGROUND: BRCA1 mutation carriers are at high risk of developing epithelial ovarian cancer, but the transitional cell variant has not been previously reported in these patients. CASE: A nulligravid, perimenopausal woman underwent exploratory laparotomy for a pelvic mass, ascites, and omental caking. Intraoperatively, frozen section of a tumor implant revealed high-grade epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Optimal surgical cytoreduction was performed. The final surgical pathology confirmed International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIIC transitional cell ovarian carcinoma. Her family history was significant for a sister with premenopausal breast cancer and a paternal aunt with ovarian cancer. The patient was counseled and elected to undergo genetic testing. Comprehensive gene sequence analysis detected the germline BRCA1 5382insC mutation. CONCLUSION: Transitional cell ovarian carcinoma is a rare histologic variant of epithelial ovarian cancer that may occur in BRCA1 mutation carriers.
12362976	Germline mutations in the BRCA1 gene predisposing to breast and ovarian cancers in Upper Silesia population.	Germline mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes predispose their carriers to breast or/and ovary cancers during their lifetime. The most frequent mutations: 5382insC, 185delAG, C61G and 4153delA in BRCA1, and 6174delT and 9631delC in BRCA2 were studied in a group of 148 probands admitted for genetic counseling, using allele-specific amplification (ASA) PCR test. Fifteen carriers of three different mutations: 5382insC, 185delAG and C61G in BRCA1 were found. Two families carried the 185delAG mutation and additional two C61G in BRCA1. Nobody carried the mutation 4153delA in BRCA1 nor 6174delT or 9631delC in BRCA2. Most of the carriers of a germline mutation were observed among the patients who developed bilateral breast cancer (17%). The lowest frequency of the germline mutations was found in the healthy persons who had two or more relatives affected with breast or ovarian cancer.
8651293	Two distinct origins of a common BRCA1 mutation in breast-ovarian cancer families: a genetic study of 15 185delAG-mutation kindreds.	We screened 163 women from breast-ovarian cancer-prone families, as well as 178 individuals affected with breast and/or ovarian cancer but unselected for family history, for germ-line mutations in exon 2 of BRCA1, by SSCP analysis and direct sequencing. A total of 25 mutations were detected. Thirteen of 64 Jewish Ashkenazi women and 2 non-Jewish individuals were found to possess the 185delAG mutation. Haplotype data for all 15 individuals, with markers intragenic to BRCA1, suggest that the Jewish Ashkenazi individuals share a common ancestry that is distinct from the lineage shared by the other two women. These data provide the first evidence of two distinct lines of transmission for the 185delAG mutation, only one of which has its origins in the Jewish Ashkenazi population. Our screening also uncovered 10 affected individuals with an 11-bp deletion at nucleotide 188 of BRCA1 (188del11), 4 of whom are Ashkenazi Jews. This is only the third reported mutation detected within the Jewish Ashkenazi population and may represent the second most common alteration in BRCA1 found in Ashkenazi Jews in the United States. The observed overrepresentation of specific mutations within a subgroup of the general population may eventually contribute to the development of inexpensive and routine tests for BRCA1 mutations, as well as to the elucidation of other contributory factors (e.g., diet, environment, and chemical exposures) that may play a key role in cancer initiation and development. The implications of the mutational data, as well as the role that founder effect, demographic history, and penetrance play in the resulting observed phenomena, are discussed.
9090499	The BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancer genes.	Between 5% and 10% of breast cancer cases result from an inherited predisposition. The majority of hereditary forms of breast and ovarian cancer can be accounted for by mutations in two recently identified genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Inactivating mutations have been found throughout both genes, and the majority are predicted to result in truncated proteins. Surprisingly, whereas germline mutations have been identified in a growing number of breast or breast and ovarian cancer families, few mutations have been reported in sporadic forms of breast or ovarian cancer. Alternative mechanisms of inactivation have been proposed, but there is currently no strong evidence that these genes are involved in sporadic forms of cancer. Recent studies suggest a role for BRCA1 in transcriptional regulation, as it possesses a conserved amino terminal RING finger domain and an acidic carboxyl domain. Although this role would be consistent with the reported localization of the BRCA1 protein to the nucleus, a cytoplasmic localization and a secretory role for BRCA1 has also been proposed. Current findings suggest that BRCA1 may play an as yet undefined protective role in cells, as it is strongly expressed in epithelial cells undergoing high levels of proliferation in association with differentiation.
9465809	Clinical and genetic evaluation of thirty ovarian cancer families.	OBJECTIVES: Our purpose was to determine the prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations among patients from ovarian cancer families and to evaluate age at diagnosis, histologic diagnosis, and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage in this group. STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed 50 ovarian cancer patients from 30 ovarian cancer families and compared relevant clinical characteristics with those of a cancer registry reference group. BRCA1 (exons 2 to 24) and BRCA2 (exon 11) germline mutations were detected by a protein truncation test and sequencing of BRCA1 exon 2 (185delAG mutation) in 25 of the 30 families. RESULTS: Ten (40%) of 25 families tested revealed a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Patients with ovarian cancer from the study group were young with an advanced International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage at diagnosis and had a relatively high frequency of serous adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSION: Direct mutation analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 revealed a high frequency of germline mutations in ovarian cancer families. Some clinical characteristics of hereditary ovarian cancer may differ from those of sporadic disease.
10065429	[Mutations in the BRCA1 gene in young Spanish women with breast cancer].	BACKGROUND: Germline mutations in the BRCA1 gene have been associated with familial breast/ovarian cancer. Furthermore, women diagnosed of early-onset breast cancer have a higher probability of being carriers of BRCA1 mutations. Our aim was to know prevalence of BRCA1 mutations in women with breast cancer diagnosed before 40 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed genomic DNA samples of 159 women with early-onset breast cancer. Ten fragments of BRCA1 gene covering the 36% of cases with mutations described in the literature were screened. Analysis involved polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single-strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCP) and direct sequencing. RESULTS: Three germline BRCA1 mutations were identified, one of them not previously described. Two mutations were found in women with familial history of breast cancer. Five additional rare variants and polymorphisms were also detected. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of recurrent mutations or mutations detected in other countries, except for the 185delAG mutation, present in Ashkenazim population, shows the influence of ethnic and geographic origin of population studied, and illustrates the difficulties of establishing DNA-based screening tests for hereditary breast cancer.
10523726	Germline mutation analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in Yugoslav breast/ovarian cancer families.	The frequency of germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations was tested in Yugoslav breast and breast/ovarian cancer families using combined heteroduplex/single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis for the entire coding region of both genes. Three different recurrent BRCA1 mutations (one 185delAG, one 3447del4 and two 5382insC) were identified in 4 of 12 families (33%), whereas no definite disease-causing alterations of BRCA2 was detected. Genotype analysis revealed a possible common founder effect for each 185delAG and 5382insC. The relatively high frequency of germline BRCA1 mutations determined in this panel of families confirms the important role of BRCA1 in disease predisposition in the Yugoslav population, while the lack of population specific founder and/or unique mutations show the need of further analysis of samples from this yet unexamined region of Europe.
10739756	BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation analysis of 208 Ashkenazi Jewish women with ovarian cancer.	Ovarian cancer is a component of the autosomal-dominant hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome and may be due to a mutation in either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Two mutations in BRCA1 (185delAG and 5382insC) and one mutation in BRCA2 (6174delT) are common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. One of these three mutations is present in approximately 2% of the Jewish population. Each mutation is associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, and it is expected that a significant proportion of Jewish women with ovarian cancer will carry one of these mutations. To estimate the proportion of ovarian cancers attributable to founding mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the Jewish population and the familial cancer risks associated with each, we interviewed 213 Jewish women with ovarian cancer at 11 medical centers in North America and Israel and offered these women genetic testing for the three founder mutations. To establish the presence of nonfounder mutations in this population, we also completed the protein-truncation test on exon 11 of BRCA1 and exons 10 and 11 of BRCA2. We obtained a detailed family history on all women we studied who had cancer and on a control population of 386 Ashkenazi Jewish women without ovarian or breast cancer. A founder mutation was present in 41.3% of the women we studied. The cumulative incidence of ovarian cancer to age 75 years was found to be 6.3% for female first-degree relatives of the patients with ovarian cancer, compared with 2.0% for the female relatives of healthy controls (relative risk 3.2; 95% CI 1.5-6.8; P=.002). The relative risk to age 75 years for breast cancer among the female first-degree relatives was 2.0 (95% CI 1.4-3.0; P=.0001). Only one nonfounder mutation was identified (in this instance, in a woman of mixed ancestry), and the three founding mutations accounted for most of the observed excess risk of ovarian and breast cancer in relatives.
10885601	Significantly lower rates of BRCA1/BRCA2 founder mutations in Ashkenazi women with sporadic compared with familial early onset breast cancer.	To delineate the clinical, genetic and family history attributes in Jewish Ashkenazi women with early onset (< 42 years) breast cancer we genotyped such women for the three predominant Jewish Ashkenazi mutations in BRCA1 (185delAG and 5382insC) and BRCA2 (6174delT). The study cohort was composed of 172 women diagnosed with breast cancer at or before the age of 42 years, obtained from the oncology department registry. Mutations were identified in 54 women (31%). Of 79 women with a positive family history for breast and/or ovarian cancer, and 93 with no such family history, 45 (57%) and 9 (10%), respectively, were mutation carriers (chi2 = 46; P < 0.001). Contralateral breast cancer occurred in 15 of 54 mutation carriers (28%) compared with 8 of 118 (7%) non-carriers (chi2= 14; P < 0.001). Early onset breast cancer per se is a weak predictor of finding germ line mutation(s) in BRCA1 and BRCA2, unless associated with a positive family history and/or bilaterality.
12096084	Gene expression profiles of BRCA1-linked, BRCA2-linked, and sporadic ovarian cancers.	"BACKGROUND: Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are responsible for 5%-10% of epithelial ovarian cancers, but the molecular pathways affected by these mutations are unknown. We used complementary DNA (cDNA) microarrays to compare gene expression patterns in ovarian cancers associated with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations with gene expression patterns in sporadic epithelial ovarian cancers and to identify patterns common to both hereditary and sporadic tumors. METHODS: Tumor samples from 61 patients with pathologically confirmed epithelial ovarian adenocarcinoma with matched clinicopathologic features were studied, including 18 with BRCA1 founder mutations, 16 with BRCA2 founder mutations, and 27 without either founder mutation (termed sporadic cancers). The cDNA microarrays contained 7651 sequence-verified features. Gene expression data were analyzed with a modified two-sided F test, with P<.0001 considered statistically significant. The expression level of six genes was also studied with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The greatest contrast in gene expression was observed between tumors with BRCA1 mutations and those with BRCA2 mutations; 110 genes showed statistically significantly different expression levels (P<.0001). This group of genes could segregate sporadic tumors into two subgroups, ""BRCA1-like"" and ""BRCA2-like,"" suggesting that BRCA1-related and BRCA2-related pathways are also involved in sporadic ovarian cancers. Fifty-three genes were differentially expressed between tumors with BRCA1 mutations and sporadic tumors; six of the 53 mapped to Xp11.23 and were expressed at higher levels in tumors with BRCA1 mutations than in sporadic tumors. Compared with the immortalized ovarian surface epithelial cells used as reference, several interferon-inducible genes were overexpressed in the majority of tumors with a BRCA mutation and in sporadic tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 may lead to carcinogenesis through distinct molecular pathways that also appear to be involved in sporadic cancers. Sporadic carcinogenic pathways may result from epigenetic aberrations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 or their downstream effectors."
12402332	A low frequency of non-founder BRCA1 mutations in Ashkenazi Jewish breast-ovarian cancer families.	"The 185delAG and 5382insC founder mutations account for the majority of mutations identified in BRCA1 in Ashkenazi Jewish breast and breast-ovarian cancer families. Few non-founder BRCA1 mutations have been identified to date in these families. We initially screened a panel of 245 Ashkenazi Jewish breast-ovarian cancer families with an affected proband and at least one other case of breast or ovarian cancer for founder mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Founder mutations were identified in 85 families (185delAG in 44 families, 5382insC in 16 families, and the BRCA2 6174delT in 25 families). The 160 negative families were then screened for the entire BRCA1 gene by a combination of DGGE and PTT. We identified one novel frameshift mutation in BRCA1 in exon 14 (4572del22) that truncated the protein at codon 1485. The family contained three cases of early-onset ovarian cancer (41 years, 43 years, and 52 years) and one case of breast cancer (at age 54 years subsequent to an ovarian cancer). In addition, three missense variants of unknown significance (exon 11 C3832T (P1238L), exon 15 G4654T (S1512I), and exon 15 G4755A (D1546N)) were found in single families. These missense variants have been previously identified in other families [BIC Database] and are considered to be ""unclassified variants, favoring polymorphism."" Non-founder BRCA1 mutations are rare in Ashkenazi Jewish breast/ovarian cancer families."
8276295	Ovarian cancer screening in asymptomatic postmenopausal women.	From 1987 to 1992, 3220 asymptomatic postmenopausal women underwent screening with transvaginal sonography (TVS) as part of the University of Kentucky Ovarian Cancer Screening Project. Ovarian volume was calculated using the prolate ellipsoid formula (length x height x width x 0.523). An abnormal sonogram was defined by (1) an ovarian volume > 10cm3 or (2) a papillary projection into a cystic ovarian tumor. All women with an abnormal TVS had a repeat sonogram in 4-6 weeks. If the repeat sonogram was abnormal, a morphology index score was assigned to each tumor, and a serum CA-125 was obtained. The patient then had a pelvic examination and an exploratory laparotomy. Forty-four patients (1.4%) with a persisting abnormality on TVS underwent exploratory laparotomy. Twenty-one patients had serous cystadenomas and 3 had primary ovarian cancers. Two patients with primary ovarian cancer had Stage IA disease and one had Stage IIIB disease. All patients with ovarian cancer had normal pelvic examinations and normal serum CA-125 levels, and are presently alive and well 32, 31, and 8 months after conventional therapy. Over 5000 screening years have been accumulated at this institution, and there have been no ovarian cancer deaths in the screened population. TVS screening has produced a decrease in stage at detection and case-specific mortality from ovarian cancer. A multi-institutional trial to test the efficacy of TVS as a screening method for ovarian cancer is indicated.
8875986	BRCA1 germline mutational spectrum in Italian families from Tuscany: a high frequency of novel mutations.	BRCA1 germline mutations confer susceptibility to familial breast and ovarian cancer. Mutational hot spots have never been detected in BRCA1 cDNA. Some mutations have been reported several times whereas some others appear to be population-related. In this study a group of 36 Italian families were analysed for BRCA1 germline mutations. All of them were screened by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization (ASO) for three recurrent mutations (185delAG, 5382insC, nt332-T>G). Twenty families, selected because of their high risk of carrying BRCA1 mutations, were subjected to analysis of the entire coding sequence of the gene. A total of eight mutations were found. ASO screening demonstrated only one known mutation in one patient, whereas cycle sequencing revealed five new mutations. Three of these new mutations were frameshifts: one occurred in exon 11 (1499insA), one in exon 16 (4873delCA) and one in the splice site of exon 3 (252delAAgt). Two were missense mutations (Cys64Arg; Asn158Tyr). The same frameshift mutation, 1499insA, was detected in three unrelated families. Haplotype analysis supported the hypothesis that two of these families may have had common ancestors, whereas in the third family the analysis was uninformative. BRCA1 germline mutations were found in one out of two families with ovarian cancer, in five out of eight families with breast-ovarian cancer, and in two out of 11 families with breast cancer. All three families with 1499insA mutations included at least one case of ovarian cancer. The majority of the ovarian cancers (4/5) associated with detectable BRCA1 germline mutations were of serous histotype.
9115959	Mutations and alternative splicing of the BRCA1 gene in UK breast/ovarian cancer families.	BRCA1 is a tumour suppressor gene located on chromosome band 17q21. It is estimated that mutations in the BRCA1 gene account for approximately 45% of the breast cancer families and almost all of the breast/ovarian cancer families. We have used single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, direct sequencing, allele specific oligonucleotide hybridisation, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to look for mutations in the BRCA1 gene in 49 breast or breast/ovarian cancer families. Five distinct mutations, three novel and two previously observed, were detected in seven families. Each novel mutation was identified in one family: 3896delT in exon 11, a splicing mutation in the intron 9-exon 10 junction, and an inferred regulatory mutation. The 185delAG in exon 2 was found in three families sharing the same haplotype, but this haplotype is different from that shared by the Ashkenazi Jewish families, suggesting that the 185delAG in our families may have arisen independently. Another previously reported mutation, the 3875del4 in exon 11, was identified in one family. Of the 49 families examined, linkage analyses for both the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 regions were performed on 33 families, and mutations in the BRCA1 gene were identified in all but one family that have a lod score above 0.8 for BRCA1. All of the mutations cause either a truncated BRCA1, or loss of a BRCA1 transcript, thus are likely to be functionally disruptive. In addition, we found that alternative splicing is a common phenomenon in the processing of the BRCA1 gene. Seven variant BRCA1 transcripts were identified by RT-PCR; all but one maintained the BRCA1 open reading frame. We believe that alternative splicing may play a significant role in modulating the physiological function of BRCA1.
10600309	BRCA1-related and sporadic ovarian cancer in the same family: implications for genetic testing.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to present a family with both BRCA1-related and sporadic ovarian cancer and address current difficulties in genetic testing. METHODS: BRCA1 mutation detection was performed on a family having four confirmed cases of ovarian cancer, two cases of breast cancer, and one case each of colon, stomach, and prostate cancer. The incidence and types of cancer were consistent with a BRCA1 mutation although previous linkage analysis had excluded this family as being due to BRCA1. RESULTS: A protein-truncating mutation in BRCA1, denoted 2799delAA, was identified in the germline DNA of each of the women affected with breast and ovarian cancer in this family except the proband, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer at age 65. CONCLUSIONS: In an earlier study, which sought to determine the proportion of site-specific ovarian cancer due to BRCA1, the family described in this report was wrongly identified as not being due to BRCA1 when, in fact, all but one of the breast and ovarian cancer cases carry a deleterious BRCA1 mutation. Our analysis suggests that the proband, who was the first of the women in this family to seek genetic counseling, developed ovarian cancer by chance and not as the result of an inherited mutation. We describe the results of our analysis in light of current issues that face clinicians who may be involved in genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer predisposition.
10682662	The prevalence of BRCA1 mutations in Chinese patients with early onset breast cancer and affected relatives.	The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of BRCA1 mutations in Chinese breast cancer patients in Singapore. BRCA1 analysis was conducted in consecutive patients with breast cancer before the age of 40 years (76 women), or whose relatives had breast or ovarian cancer (16 women). Ten patients had both early onset breast cancer and affected relatives. Genomic DNA from peripheral mononuclear blood cells was studied by using the protein transcription-translation assay (exon 11) and single-strand conformational polymorphism, with subsequent DNA sequencing. All six disease-causing mutations occurred in women under 40 years (8.6%) with three occurring in patients under 35 years (three out of 22 patients, 13.6%). Mis-sense mutations of unknown significance were found in three patients. Two of the ten women with affected relatives under 40 years had BRCA1 mutations. The prevalence of BRCA1 mutations in Chinese patients with early onset breast cancer is similar to that observed in Caucasian women. Most Chinese patients with affected relatives were not carriers of BRCA1 mutations.
11683778	Hereditary breast/ovarian cancer--pitfalls in genetic counseling.	Genetic counseling and risk assessment, given to women with a family history of breast/ovarian cancer, are regularly based on pedigree analysis. In the Ashkenazi Jewish population, hereditary breast/ovarian cancer is mainly attributed to three founder mutations, namely, 185delAG, 5382insC, and 6174delT, in BRCA1/2 genes. The overall frequency of these mutations, in the Jewish Ashkenazi population, is as high as 2.5%. Based on clinical and family history data, the results of BRCA molecular testing, in Ashkenazi individuals at risk, are appropriately anticipated in most cases. Here we report on five families, in which the segregation of BRCA1/2 mutations, in affected and unaffected family members, was unexpected, emphasizing the need to test, for founder mutations, every Ashkenazi individual at risk, irrespective of the genotype of affected family members. Ultimately, risk assessments and recommendations, in Ashkenazi women, should be invariably based on the results of genetic testing.
11786575	Effect of BRCA mutations on the length of survival in epithelial ovarian tumors.	PURPOSE: To study the role of BRCA mutations in ovarian cancer survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Blood samples and specimens of ovarian tumors (whenever blood samples were not available) at the time of the primary surgery were obtained in the course of a nationwide case-control study of women with ovarian cancer in Israel. The three common BRCA mutations in Israel (185delAG, 5382insC, and 6174delT) were analyzed with a multiplex polymerase chain reaction to amplify the exons containing the three mutations using fluor-labeled primers in a single reaction. Because each mutation is a small insertion or deletion, they can be detected as length polymorphisms. Patients were followed for up to 5 years (range, 20 to 64 months). Statistical analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Stepwise Cox regression analysis was used for determination of independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: This report is based on 896 blood or tumor specimens analyzed for the presence of the BRCA mutations. Of these, 234 women (26.1%) were found to be positive. A significant difference in survival pattern was found between BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers and noncarriers among the women with invasive ovarian cancer (median survival, 53.4 months v. 37.8 months; 3-year survival, 65.8% v. 51.9%, respectively). These differences were independent of age at diagnosis or stage of the disease. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that the survival of patients with ovarian cancer is affected by BRCA germline mutation, at least in the early years after diagnosis.
12237285	Inactivation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in ovarian cancer.	"BACKGROUND: Although BRCA1 and BRCA2 play important roles in hereditary ovarian cancers, the extent of their role in sporadic ovarian cancers and their mechanisms of inactivation are not yet well understood. Our goal was to characterize BRCA2 mutations and mRNA expression in a group of ovarian tumors previously evaluated for BRCA1 mutations and mRNA expression. METHODS: The tumors of 92 unrelated women with ""ovarian"" cancer (i.e., ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer) were screened for BRCA2 null mutations using a protein truncation test. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to examine the BRCA2 promoter for hypermethylation in tumors that did not express BRCA2 mRNA. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Nine tumors had a germline (n = 5) or somatic (n = 4) BRCA2 mutation; each was associated with loss of heterozygosity. All of the somatic (1445delC, E880X, 4286del8, and 5783delT) and one of the germline (5984ins4) mutations were unique to this study. One tumor had somatic mutations in both BRCA1 and BRCA2. Two tumors are, to our knowledge, the first cases of germline BRCA2-associated peritoneal cancer. Twelve additional tumors lacked detectable BRCA2 mRNA, but the BRCA2 promoter was hypermethylated in only one of them, suggesting that other mechanisms effect transcriptional silencing of BRCA2. Tumors lacking BRCA1 mRNA were more likely to lack BRCA2 mRNA than tumors expressing BRCA1 mRNA (P<.001). Overall, 82% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 74% to 90%) of the tumors contained alterations in BRCA1, BRCA2, or both genes. Of 41 informative tumors with some alteration in BRCA2, 36 also had an alteration in BRCA1. The frequency, but not the mechanism, of BRCA1 or BRCA2 dysfunction in ovarian cancer was independent of family history. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple mechanisms cause nearly universal dysfunction of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 in hereditary and sporadic ovarian carcinoma. Ovarian cancers with BRCA2 dysfunction often have simultaneous BRCA1 dysfunction."
7939630	BRCA1 mutations in primary breast and ovarian carcinomas.	Loss of heterozygosity data from familial tumors suggest that BRCA1, a gene that confers susceptibility to ovarian and early-onset breast cancer, encodes a tumor suppressor. The BRCA1 region is also subject to allelic loss in sporadic breast and ovarian cancers, an indication that BRCA1 mutations may occur somatically in these tumors. The BRCA1 coding region was examined for mutations in primary breast and ovarian tumors that show allele loss at the BRCA1 locus. Mutations were detected in 3 of 32 breast and 1 of 12 ovarian carcinomas; all four mutations were germline alterations and occurred in early-onset cancers. These results suggest that mutation of BRCA1 may not be critical in the development of the majority of breast and ovarian cancers that arise in the absence of a mutant germline allele.
10728701	BRCA1 and BRCA2 have a limited role in familial prostate cancer.	Epidemiological studies have suggested that the breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, may be involved in the development of prostate cancer. Several studies have screened prostate cancer populations for the presence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, with few mutations identified. In this study, 22 high-risk prostate cancer families (at least three cases of prostate cancer) were screened by conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. To maximize the chance of finding mutations in these two genes, families were also selected for the presence of at least two cases of breast and/or ovarian cancer. We identified one previously reported BRCA2 missense mutation and two previously unreported BRCA2 intron polymorphisms. No BRCA1 or BRCA2 truncating mutations were detected. Thus, BRCA1 and BRCA2 appear to have a limited role in familial prostate cancer, and families with both prostate and breast cancer may result from mutations in other predisposition genes.
10802632	Universal DNA array detection of small insertions and deletions in BRCA1 and BRCA2.	Array-based mutation detection methodology typically relies on direct hybridization of the fluorescently labeled query sequence to surface-bound oligonucleotide probes. These probes contain either small sequence variations or perfect-match sequence. The intensity of fluorescence bound to each oligonucleotide probe is intended to reveal which sequence is perfectly complementary to the query sequence. However, these approaches have not always been successful, especially for detection of small frameshift mutations. Here we describe a multiplex assay to detect small insertions and deletions by using a modified PCR to evenly amplify each amplicon (PCR/PCR), followed by ligase detection reaction (LDR). Mutations were identified by screening reaction products with a universal DNA microarray, which uncouples mutation detection from array hybridization and provides for high sensitivity. Using the three BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder mutations in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (BRCA1 185delAG; BRCA1 5382insC; BRCA2 6174delT) as a model system, the assay readily detected these mutations in multiplexed reactions. Our results demonstrate that universal microarray analysis of PCR/PCR/LDR products permits rapid identification of small insertion and deletion mutations in the context of both clinical diagnosis and population studies.
10926794	Founder BRCA 1 and 2 mutations among a consecutive series of Ashkenazi Jewish ovarian cancer patients.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the incidence of the three Ashkenazi Jewish founder genetic BRCA 1 and 2 mutations among an unselected, consecutive group of Ashkenazi Jewish ovarian cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 7/30/96 to 4/12/99, 92 Ashkenazi Jewish patients with histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer had surgery. All of these patients had DNA extracted from 5-microm sections of their paraffin-embedded surgical specimen tissue blocks using the Qiagen QIAamp tissue extraction kit. A multiplex (triplex) polymerase chain reaction was performed to amplify fragments for the 185delAG, 5382insC, and 6174delT mutations. The products were hybridized with normal and mutant probes for each of the three mutations. All clinical data were collected retrospectively and statistical significance was evaluated using the chi(2) test or a two-tailed Fisher's exact test, depending on the sample size. RESULTS: There were 23 patients positive for one of the three founder BRCA mutations. Fourteen patients were positive for the 185delAG mutation, 2 patients were positive for the 5382insC mutation, and 7 patients were positive for the 6174 delT mutation (61, 9, and 30%, respectively). This represented a 25% incidence (95% CI: 16-34%) of one of the three founder BRCA mutations among our 92 Ashkenazi Jewish ovarian cancer patients. None of the patients was positive for more than one mutation. There was no statistically significant difference in parity, histology, grade, or stage between the BRCA founder mutation positive and negative patients. The difference between the percentage of mutation carriers among patients with one affected first-degree relative (13/22 or 59%) compared to those without at least one affected first-degree relative (10/70 or 14%) was highly significant (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Ashkenazi Jewish ovarian cancer patients represent a group with a high likelihood of being carriers of BRCA 1 and 2 genetic mutations, regardless of family history. As a result, all ovarian cancer patients who are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent should be counseled regarding BRCA 1 and 2 genetic screening, as well as the potential implications of these results for the patient as well as her relatives in terms of prognosis, screening, chemoprevention, and consideration of prophylactic surgical procedures.
11766733	No BRCA1 germline mutation in a family with uterine papillary serous carcinoma: a case report.	The purpose of the study was to examine BRCA1 germline mutation and its relationship to BRCA1 expression in two patients, a mother and a daughter, both diagnosed with uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC). DNA was screened for BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations common in the Jewish population (185delAG, 5382insC, and 6174delT) by PCR-based assay and with a protein truncation test (PTT) to detect mutation in exon 11 of BRCA1 and exons 10 and 11 of BRCA2. BRCA1 expression in fixed tumor tissues was assessed by immunocytochemistry (IHC). No germline mutation in either BRCAI or BRCA2 gene was found in the two patients. Both samples showed reduced levels of BRCAI expression. Taken together, these results suggest that undetected or unscreened for germline mutation may be associated with occurrence of this rare tumor type in two members of the same family. Alternatively, an epigenetic mechanism such as BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation may be responsible for reduced expression of BRCA1 in the absence of DNA mutations.
12360400	BRCA1 interacts with acetyl-CoA carboxylase through its tandem of BRCT domains.	Germ-line alterations in BRCA1 are associated with an increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA1 is a 220-kDa protein that contains a tandem of two BRCA1 C-Terminal (BRCT) domains. Among missense and nonsense BRCA1 mutations responsible for family breast cancer, some are located into the BRCT tandem of BRCA1 coding sequence. In an attempt to understand how BRCT is critical for BRCA1 function, we search for partners of this BRCT tandem of BRCA1. Using a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay with murine cells, we isolated only one major BRCA1-interacting protein, further identified as Acetyl Coenzyme A (CoA) Carboxylase alpha (ACCA). We showed that this interaction is conserved through murine and human species. We also delineated the minimum interacting region as being the whole tandem of BRCT domains. We demonstrated that BRCA1 interacts in vitro and in vivo with ACCA. This interaction is completely abolished by five distinct germline BRCA1 deleterious mutations affecting the BRCT tandem of BRCA1. Interestingly, ACCA originally known as a rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acids biosynthesis, has been recently shown to be over-expressed in breast cancers and considered as a potential target for anti-neoplastic therapy. Furthermore, our observation is making a bridge between the genetic factors involved in susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancers, and environmental factors such as nutrition considered as key elements in the etiology of those cancers.
9099656	Contribution of BRCA1 mutations to ovarian cancer.	BACKGROUND: Inherited mutations in the BRCA1 gene confer a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer in some families. To determine the contribution of BRCA1 mutations to ovarian cancer in the general population, we analyzed DNA samples from a consecutive series of women with ovarian cancer seen at one center. METHODS: We studied 374 women who received a diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer before the age of 70 years and were treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital between July 1993 and September 1995. Genomic DNA was analyzed by multiplex heteroduplex analysis. Variants were further identified by sequencing. RESULTS: Probable germ-line BRCA1 mutations were identified in 13 of the 374 women (3 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 2 to 6 percent). Six of the variants have not been described previously. Of the 13 mutations, 12 are predicted to result in a truncated protein product. An additional variant results in an in-frame deletion just outside the putative zinc-finger domain. Nine of the 12 women with truncating mutations had family histories of breast or ovarian cancer or both. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming that our method has a sensitivity of 70 percent, mutations in BRCA1 occur in approximately 5 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 8 percent) of women in whom ovarian cancer is diagnosed before the age of 70 years.
10804288	Screening of BRCA1 mutation using immunohistochemical staining with C-terminal and N-terminal antibodies in familial ovarian cancers.	We examined the subcellular localization of BRCA1 proteins using immunohistochemical staining with C-terminal (GLK-2 antibody) and N-terminal (Ab-2 antibody) monoclonal antibodies in 44 familial ovarian cancers. Among these, 24 cases were associated with 13 independent germ-line mutations of BRCA1, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at one or more BRCA1 microsatellite markers was found in all 21 informative tumors tested. With GLK-2 antibody, cytoplasmic staining was observed in 15 of 16 tumors (93.8%) with mutation in exon 11, and BRCA1 staining was absent in 8 of 8 tumors (100%) with mutation in exons other than exon 11. When immunohistochemical staining was performed with Ab-2 antibody, both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining were observed in 14 of 16 tumors (87.5%) with mutation in exon 11. Interestingly, nuclear staining was observed in 3 of 3 tumors (100%) with mutation downstream of exon 11, even though no staining was detected in 5 of 5 tumors (100%) with mutation upstream of exon 11. On the other hand, in familial ovarian cancers without BRCA1 mutations, nuclear staining or both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining was observed in 18 of 20 specimens (90%) and 20 of 20 specimens (100%) with GLK-2 antibody and with Ab-2 antibody, respectively. These results suggest that an immunohistochemical assay in combination with employing the C-terminal and the N-terminal antibodies appears to have potential as a reliable and useful technique for the screening of BRCA1 mutations, at least to predict the status of mutation, upstream or downstream of exon 11.
10897034	Frequent loss of BRCA1 mRNA and protein expression in sporadic ovarian cancers.	Germline mutations in the BRCA1 gene cause inherited susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancers. However, somatic mutations of BRCA1 are rare in sporadic breast and ovarian tumours. To establish whether BRCA1 is altered during the development of sporadic ovarian cancer by mechanisms other than somatic mutation, we have analysed 57 sporadic epithelial ovarian tumours for BRCA1 protein and RNA expression. Reduced or absent protein expression was observed in 90% of tumours. Decreased protein expression was significantly associated with a reduction in the levels of RNA expression. Somatic mutations of BRCA1 and LOH at the BRCA1 locus were detected in 3.5% and 44% of informative tumours, respectively; there was no significant correlation between the levels of protein and RNA expression and the DNA mutation and/or LOH status. Together, these data suggest that expression of BRCA1 is down-regulated at the level of transcription during the development of sporadic ovarian cancers.
11332994	Construction and characterization of recombinant adenoviruses expressing human BRCA1 or murine Brca1 genes.	Recombinant adenoviruses expressing human BRCA1 (AdBRCA1), murine Brca1 (AdBrca1), three clinically relevant human mutant BRCA1 proteins (t340, C61G, and 1853Stop), or a murine Brca1 C-terminal deletion mutant were constructed and evaluated in vitro. These recombinants were capable of transducing high-level transgene expression to a wide variety of cell lines in vitro. Three independent methods were utilized to monitor cell growth following transduction with these recombinants. High-level expression of either the human or mouse wild-type BRCA1 protein was incompatible with maximal levels of cell growth. AdBRCA1 transduction inhibited the outgrowth of several human breast and ovarian cell lines in colony formation assays. Flow cytometric analysis revealed an accumulation of the transduced cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. This BRCA1-mediated accumulation of cells in G0/G1 was accompanied by an increase in the cellular level of hypophosphorylated pRB. Ad mutant BRCA1 t340, C61G, and 1853Stop viruses were impaired, to varying degrees, in their ability to transduce a growth-arrested state to the target cells. Using these same three criteria, overexpression of murine Brca1 by AdBrca1 was also capable of transducing a growth-arrested state to human cells. Deletion of the C-terminus of Brca1 diminished this activity. This panel of adenoviruses may be useful reagents as part of an approach to understand the function of BRCA1/Brca1 in normal breast and ovary and help to define the tumor suppressor defect (s) conferred by clinical BRCA1 mutations in breast and ovarian cell tumorigenesis.
12918074	Hereditary ovarian cancer in Poland.	There is increasing evidence that hereditary factors play a greater role in ovarian cancer than in any of the other common cancers of adulthood. This is attributable, to a large extent, to a high frequency of mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. In Poland, 3 common founder mutations in BRCA1 account for the majority of families with identified BRCA mutations. Our study was conducted in order to estimate the prevalence of any of 3 founder BRCA1 mutations (5382insC, C61G and 4153delA) in 364 unselected women with ovarian cancer, and among 177 women with ovarian cancer and a family history of breast or ovarian cancer. A mutation was identified in 49 out of 364 unselected women with ovarian cancer (13.5%) and in 58 of 177 women with familial ovarian cancer (32.8%). The majority of women with ovarian cancer and a BRCA1 mutation have no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. The high frequency of BRCA1 mutations in Polish women with ovarian cancer supports the recommendation that all Polish women with ovarian cancer should be offered testing for genetic susceptibility, and that counseling services be made available to them and to their relatives. It is important that mutation surveys be conducted in other countries prior to the introduction of national genetic screening programs.
7663517	Rapid detection of BRCA1 mutations by the protein truncation test.	More than 75% of the reported mutations in the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer gene, BRCA1, result in truncated proteins. We have used the protein truncation test (PTT) to screen for mutations in exon 11, which encodes 61% of BRCA1. In 45 patients from breast and/or ovarian cancer families we found six novel mutations: two single nucleotide insertions, three small deletions (1-5 bp) and a nonsense mutation identified two unrelated families. Furthermore, we were able to amplify the remaining coding region by RT-PCR using lymphocyte RNA. Combined with PTT, we detected aberrantly spliced products affecting exons 5 and 6 in one of two BRCA1-linked families examined. The protein truncation test promises to become a valuable technique in detecting BRCA1 mutations.
8129392	[Clinical significance of galactosyltransferase associated with tumor (GAT), a new tumor marker for ovarian cancer--with special reference to the discrimination between ovarian cancer and endometriosis].	We examined GAT, a newly developed tumor marker, in serum samples collected from 1,503 females in six institutions: 387 healthy females, 1,052 patients with gynecological diseases including 311 ovarian cancers, and 64 with nongynecological diseases. Based on the mean value + 2 SD for the healthy females, the cut-off value was set at 16 U/ml. The positive rate of GAT was 2.6% for the healthy females, 7.1% for patients with benign ovarian tumor, 5.6% for those with endometriosis, 47.9% for those with ovarian cancers, 9.3% for those with cervical cancer, and 13.3% for those with endometrial cancer. The false-positive rate of GAT for endometriosis was very low compared with that of the other markers such as CA 125, CA 602, CA 54/61, CA 72-4, STN, SLX examined in this study. The positive predictive value between ovarian cancer and endometriosis was the highest with GAT among the evaluated markers. In the cases in which the CA 125 (CA 602) value is relatively low, discrimination between ovarian cancer and endometriosis is difficult, because these cases include many patients with endometriosis. GAT showed the highest positive predictive value in such cases, so GAT proved to play a complementary role with CA 125 (CA 602). Combination assay with GAT and CA 54/61/CA 72-4/STN or SLX showed higher diagnostic efficiency between ovarian cancer and endometriosis. These results suggest the usefulness of GAT for discrimination between ovarian cancer and endometriosis.
9662340	BRCA1 as a potential human prostate tumor suppressor: modulation of proliferation, damage responses and expression of cell regulatory proteins.	In addition to breast and ovarian cancer in women, recent evidence suggests that germ-line mutations of the breast cancer susceptibility gene-1 (BRCA1) also confer an increased life-time risk for prostate cancer in male probands. However, it is not known if and how BRCA1 functions in prostate cancer. We stably expressed wild-type (wt) and tumor-associated mutant BRCA1 transgenes in DU-145, a human prostate cancer cell line with low endogenous expression of BRCA1. As compared with parental cells and vector transfected clones, wtBRCA1 clones exhibited: (1) a slightly decreased proliferation rate (doubling time = 25 h as compared with 22 h for control cells); (2) a (3-6)-fold increase in sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs (adriamycin, camptothecin, and taxol); (3) increased susceptibility to drug-induced apoptosis; (4) reduced repair of single-strand DNA strand breaks; and (5) alterations in expression of key cellular regulatory proteins (including BRCA2, p300, Mdm-2, p21(WAF1/CIP1), Bcl-2 and Bax). Clones transfected with the 5677insA breast cancer-associated mutant BRCA1 (insBRCA1) displayed a similar phenotype to wtBRCA1 clones, except that insBRCA1 clones had a significantly decreased proliferation rate (doubling time = 42 h). On the other hand, cells transfected with with 185delAG mutant BRCA1 showed no obvious phenotype as compared with parental or vector transfected cells. These findings suggest that BRCA1 may function as a human prostate tumor suppressor by virtue of its ability to modulate proliferation and various components of the cellular damage response. They also suggest several potential target gene products for a BRCA1 prostate tumor suppressor function.
10196379	Germline BRCA1 alterations in a population-based series of ovarian cancer cases.	The objective of this study was to provide more accurate frequency estimates of breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 ( BRCA1 ) germline alterations in the ovarian cancer population. To achieve this, we determined the prevalence of BRCA1 alterations in a population-based series of consecutive ovarian cancer cases. This is the first population-based ovarian cancer study reporting BRCA1 alterations derived from a comprehensive screen of the entire coding region. One hundred and seven ovarian cancer cases were analyzed for BRCA1 alterations using the RNase mismatch cleavage assay followed by direct sequencing. Two truncating mutations, 962del4 and 3600del11, were identified. Both patients had a family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Several novel as well as previously reported uncharacterized variants were also identified, some of which were associated with a family history of cancer. The frequency distribution of common polymorphisms was determined in the 91 Caucasian cancer cases in this series and 24 sister controls using allele-specific amplification. The rare form of the Q356R polymorphism was significantly ( P = 0.03) associated with a family history of ovarian cancer, suggesting that this polymorphism may influence ovarian cancer risk. In summary, our data suggest a role for some uncharacterized variants and rare forms of polymorphisms in determining ovarian cancer risk, and highlight the necessity to screen for missense alterations as well as truncating mutations in this population.
12767038	BRCA1 gene in breast cancer.	The BRCA1 gene was identified and cloned in 1994 based its linkage to early onset breast cancer and breast-ovarian cancer syndromes in women. While inherited mutations of BRCA1 are responsible for about 40-45% of hereditary breast cancers, these mutations account for only 2-3% of all breast cancers, since the BRCA1 gene is rarely mutated in sporadic breast cancers. However, BRCA1 expression is frequently reduced or absent in sporadic cancers, suggesting a much wider role in mammary carcinogenesis. Since BRCA1 was cloned in 1994, its molecular function has been the subject of intense investigation. These studies have revealed multiple functions of the BRCA1 that may contribute to its tumor suppressor activity, including roles in: cell cycle progression, several highly specialized DNA repair processes, DNA damage-responsive cell cycle check-points, regulation of a set of specific transcriptional pathways, and apoptosis. Many of these functions are linked to protein:protein interactions involving different portions of the 1,863 amino acid (aa) BRCA1 protein. BRCA1 functions in cell cycle progression and the DNA damage response appear to be regulated by distinct and specific phosphorylation events, but the molecular pathways activated by these phosphorylations are only beginning to be unraveled. In addition, the reason that BRCA1 mutation carriers develop specific tumor types (breast and ovarian cancers in women and possibly prostate cancers in men) is not clearly understood. Elucidation of the precise molecular functions of the BRCA1 gene product will greatly enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of hereditary as well as sporadic mammary carcinogenesis.
7891765	[Initial Dutch results with a presymptomatic DNA tests in familial breast/ovarian carcinoma. Rotterdamse Werkgroep voor Erfelijke Tumoren].	Recent discoveries in the field of molecular-genetic research make it possible to detect an increased genetic risk of tumours, because several genes are linked to hereditary forms of breast cancer. The breast cancer gene BRCA1, located on chromosome 17q, is quantitatively the most important gene so far. A BRCA1 gene mutation is estimated to occur in 1-3 per 1000 women in the general population, i.e. in about 10,000 women among the 4 million Dutch women aged 25-55 years. In this study experiences are described concerning oncologic, clinical-genetic and psychologic aspects in the first Dutch family in which a BRCA1-gene defect was detected with the corresponding hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome. Of the relatives 88% participated in the genetic family study and 76% wished to be informed on the individual DNA-test results. From the first-degree relatives of the breast cancer patients 54% appeared to be gene mutation carrier. The detection of a gene mutation in a woman could make her decide to undergo preventive mastectomy and (or) ovariectomy, besides regular breast examination and mammography. Surgeons and radiotherapists, the group of doctors who treat primary breast cancer, have to anticipate more radical operations with regard to breasts in this selected group of (future) patients. Detection of the gene may also have consequences for family planning. Identification of carriers of the gene mutation can lead to a selection of women with increased risk of breast cancer. Primary or secondary preventive measures, early diagnostic management and regular examination may lead to a decrease in death from breast cancer.
9610465	Screening semen donors for hereditary diseases. The Fairfax cryobank experience.	OBJECTIVE: To study the carrier frequency of hereditary diseases in potential semen donors with no family history of a genetic disease. STUDY DESIGN: Carrier screening was performed on potential semen donors for chromosomal abnormalities, cystic fibrosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, hemoglobinopathies, Tay-Sachs disease, Gaucher disease, Canavan disease, and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (the BRCA1 185delAG mutation). The screening regimen used for each donor was dictated by his ethnic background. RESULTS: Among 361 individuals screened for chromosomal abnormalities, 1 carried an inversion, and 4 were possible mosaics. Fifteen of 407 potential donors carried cystic fibrosis, 18 of 209 carried alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, and 2 of 74 carried a hemoglobinopathy. No carriers of Tay-Sachs disease (56 screened), Gaucher disease (32 screened), Canavan disease (22 screened) or the BRCA1 185delAG mutation (22 screened) were found. CONCLUSION: Screening semen donors for a number of genetic diseases that are passed silently from generation to generation is warranted since family history alone cannot identify them.
10467410	Somatic mutations in the BRCA1 gene in Chinese sporadic breast and ovarian cancer.	Inherited mutations in the BRCA1 gene confer increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. Its role in sporadic carcinogenesis is not well defined. Somatic mutations in breast cancers have not been reported and to date there are only three reports of somatic mutations in sporadic ovarian cancers. To investigate the contribution of BRCA1 mutations to sporadic breast and ovarian cancer in the Chinese population, we analysed 62 samples from Chinese women using the protein truncation test. There were 40 cases of breast cancer under age 50 and 22 cases of ovarian cancer, all unselected for family history. There was no age selection for the ovarian cancers. We found two somatic BRCA1 mutations in exon 11, one in a breast cancer and the other in an ovarian cancer, both of which result in truncated proteins. Our results indicate that somatic BRCA1 mutations, like somatic mutations in the BRCA2 gene, though very rare, can be found in both breast and ovarian cancers and support a tumor suppressor function for BRCA1 in sporadic tumors.
11260866	Identification of a recurrent BRCA1 mutation in German breast-cancer and/or ovarian-cancer families.	Specific BRCA1 mutations have been reported to be common within particular populations. We have investigated German breast- and/or ovarian-cancer families and detected a recurrent carboxy-terminal BRCA1 mutation, 5622C > T, using PCR-based restriction assay and haplotype analysis. Unrelated families carrying this BRCA1 mutation shared two different disease-associated haplotypes, indicating two independent mutation events.
14615451	Fallopian tube and primary peritoneal carcinomas associated with BRCA mutations.	PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of BRCA mutations among Ashkenazi Jewish patients with fallopian tube carcinoma (FTC) or primary peritoneal carcinoma (PPC), to study the clinicopathologic features of these cancers, and to estimate the risks of these cancers in association with a BRCA mutation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review at two institutions identified 29 Jewish patients with FTC and 22 Jewish patients with PPC. These patients were genotyped for the three Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA founder mutations (185delAG and 5382insC in BRCA1 and 6174delT in BRCA2). Surgical and pathologic information, family history, and survival data were obtained from hospital records. All statistical tests were two sided. RESULTS: Germline BRCA mutations were identified in five of 29 patients with FTC (17%) and nine of 22 patients with PPC (41%). Mutation carriers had a younger mean age at diagnosis than patients without a mutation (60 v 70 years; P =.002). The overall median survival was 148 months for mutation carriers and 41 months for patients without a mutation (P =.04). For BRCA mutation carriers, the lifetime risks of FTC and PPC were 0.6% and 1.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Substantial proportions of Ashkenazi Jewish patients with FTC or PPC are BRCA mutation carriers. Patients with BRCA-associated FTC or PPC are younger at diagnosis and have improved survival compared with patients without a BRCA mutation. Although the lifetime risks of FTC or PPC for patients with BRCA heterozygotes are greater than those for the general population, the absolute risks seem relatively low.
7959295	Augmentative effects of intracellular chemotherapy penetration combined with hyperthermia in human ovarian cancer cells lines.	A significant proportion of ovarian cancer patients do not achieve a complete response to chemotherapy, due mainly to the evolution of clones resistant to cytotoxic drugs. Exploring possibilities to overcome this resistance constitutes a challenge in the study of ovarian cancer experimental therapy. In the present study, we tested the effect of hyperthermia (40 and 43 degrees C) in combination with adriamycin on three human epithelial ovarian cell lines: OC-109, OC-238, and OC-7-NU. The first was derived from the mucinous and the other two from serous cystadenocarcinomas, and all proved to be tumorigenic in nude mice. FACS analysis showed a pronounced increase in intracellular adriamycin accumulation in the presence of hyperthermia. A significant effect (P < 0.0005) observed at 40 degrees C was even more pronounced at 43 degrees C with the three cell lines. High percentages of cells (up to 70%) shifted into higher fluorescence intensities. The lines differed in their sensitivity to the hyperthermia-induced increase in adriamycin accumulation. Under mild conditions, the OC-109 line was more sensitive than the OC-238 and the OC-7-NU lines. Quantitative determination of intraneoplastic adriamycin by spectrofluorometry also showed a hyperthermia-related increase in intracellular adriamycin (P < 0.005). Our results may indicate that supranormal temperature might serve as an alternative chemosensitizer which lacks the deleterious side effects of other chemosensitizing options.
9145678	Differential contributions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 to early-onset breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: Germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes predispose women to breast cancer. BRCA1 mutations are found in approximately 12 percent of women with breast cancer of early onset, and the specific mutation causing a deletion of adenine and guanine (185delAG), which is present in 1 percent of the Ashkenazi Jewish population, contributes to 21 percent of breast cancers among young Jewish women. The contribution of BRCA2 mutations to breast cancer of early onset is unknown. METHODS: Lymphocyte specimens from 73 women with breast cancer diagnosed by the age of 32 were studied for heterozygous mutations of BRCA2 by a complementary-DNA-based protein-truncation assay, followed by automated nucleotide sequencing. In addition, specimens from 39 Jewish women with breast cancer diagnosed by the age of 40 were tested for specific mutations by an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Definite BRCA2 mutations were found in 2 of the 73 women with early-onset breast cancer (2.7 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.4 to 9.6 percent), suggesting that BRCA2 is associated with fewer cases than BRCA1 (P=0.03). The specific BRCA2 mutation causing a deletion of thymine (6174delT), which is found in 1.3 percent of the Ashkenazi Jewish population, was observed in 1 of the 39 young Jewish women with breast cancer (2.6 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.09 to 13.5 percent), indicating that it has a small role as a risk factor for early-onset breast cancer. Among young women with breast cancer, there are BRCA2 mutations that cause truncation of the extreme C terminus of the protein and that may be functionally silent, along with definite truncating mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Germ-line mutations in BRCA2 contribute to fewer cases of breast cancer among young women than do mutations in BRCA1. Carriers of BRCA2 mutations may have a smaller increase in the risk of early-onset breast cancer.
11844822	BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation frequency in women evaluated in a breast cancer risk evaluation clinic.	PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in families identified in a breast cancer risk evaluation clinic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred sixty-four families seeking breast cancer risk evaluation were screened for coding region mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 by conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Mutations were identified in 37 families (22.6%); 28 (17.1%) had BRCA1 mutations and nine (5.5%) had BRCA2 mutations. The Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations 185delAG and 5382insC (BRCA1) were found in 10 families (6.1%). However, 6174delT (BRCA2) was found in only one family (0.6%) despite estimates of equal frequency in the Ashkenazi population. In contrast to other series, the average age of breast cancer diagnosis was earlier in BRCA2 mutation carriers (32.1 years) than in women with BRCA1 mutations (37.6 years, P =.028). BRCA1 mutations were detected in 20 (45.5%) of 44 families with ovarian cancer and 12 (75%) of 16 families with both breast and ovarian cancer in a single individual. Significantly fewer BRCA2 mutations (two [4.5%] of 44) were detected in families with ovarian cancer (P =.01). Eight families had male breast cancer; one had a BRCA1 mutation and three had BRCA2 mutations. CONCLUSION: BRCA1 mutations were three times more prevalent than BRCA2 mutations. Breast cancer diagnosis before 50 years of age, ovarian cancer, breast and ovarian cancer in a single individual, and male breast cancer were all significantly more common in families with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, but none of these factors distinguished between BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Evidence for reduced breast cancer penetrance associated with the BRCA2 mutation 6174delT was noted.
12585647	Mutations of BRCA genes in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.	BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the main genetic elements associated with hereditary susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer that have been isolated to date. DNA analysis can identify carriers of mutations in these genes, who, accordingly, can benefit by adequate clinical programs for the reduction of cancer risk. Unfortunately, the analysis is complicated by the complexity of associated mutation spectra. The procedure for mutation testing in BRCA genes and its limitations are discussed.
12717416	Role of BRCA1 in cellular resistance to paclitaxel and ionizing radiation in an ovarian cancer cell line carrying a defective BRCA1.	BRCA1, the gene responsible for approximately half of all cases of hereditary breast cancer and almost all cases of combined hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, has been implicated in the maintenance of genomic stability through DNA repair. This function is mediated, at least in part, through two tandem BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) repeats. The role of BRCA1 in the development of ovarian cancer is poorly understood, partially owing to the lack of ovarian cancer cell lines with defective BRCA1. The purpose of this study was to further characterize an endometrioid ovarian cancer cell line, SNU-251, which was previously reported to carry a nonsense mutation (from G to A) at amino acid 1815 of BRCA1. In addition, we examined the role of BRCA1 in the cell cycle and in the responses to the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel and ionizing radiation. Loss of the C-terminal 49 amino acids due to this point mutation did not affect the expression of the truncated BRCA1 protein, but caused a loss of transcriptional activation of the endogenous p21(WAF1/CIP1) gene, and could not sustain arrest in the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. The BRCA1 mutation in SNU-251 cells inhibited BRCA1 subnuclear assembly for DNA-damage repair and increased cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation and paclitaxel. This sensitivity was reversed by reintroduction of ectopic wild-type BRCA1. Our results suggest that the deletion of the C-terminal 49 amino acids of BRCA1 results in a loss of BRCA1 function in the SNU-251 cell line. BRCA1 helps to mediate the resistance to both radiation and paclitaxel. Therefore, SNU-251 may be a useful model for studying the molecular mechanism of BRCA1 in the resistance of ovarian cancer to ionizing radiation and chemotherapy treatment and in the development of hereditary human ovarian cancer.
10037104	Survival after breast cancer in Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.	BACKGROUND: Studies of survival following breast and ovarian cancers in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutation carriers have yielded conflicting results. We undertook an analysis of a community-based study of Ashkenazi Jews to investigate the effect of three founder mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 on survival among patients with breast or ovarian cancer. METHODS: We collected blood samples and questionnaire data from 5318 Ashkenazi Jewish volunteers. The blood samples were tested for 185delAG (two nucleotide deletion) and 5382insC (single nucleotide insertion) mutations in BRCA1 and the 6174delT (single nucleotide deletion) mutation in BRCA2. To estimate survival differences in the affected relatives according to their BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutation carrier status, we devised and applied a novel extension of the kin-cohort method. RESULTS: Fifty mutation carriers reported that 58 of their first-degree relatives had been diagnosed with breast cancer and 10 with ovarian cancer; 907 noncarriers reported 979 first-degree relatives with breast cancer and 116 with ovarian cancer. Kaplan-Meier estimates of median survival after breast cancer were 16 years (95% confidence interval [CI] = 11-40) in the relatives of carriers and 18 years (95% CI = 15-22) in the relatives of noncarriers, a difference that was not statistically significant (two-sided P = .87). There was also no difference in survival times among the 126 first-degree relatives with ovarian cancer. We found no survival difference between patients with breast or ovarian cancer who were inferred carriers of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutations and noncarriers. CONCLUSIONS: Carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations appeared to have neither better nor worse survival prognosis.
11785296	[Search for frequently encountered mutations in genes predisposing to breast cancer].	DNA of oncological patients, including Ashkenazi Jews and Slavs, living in St. Petersburg was collected, and the resultant collection was screened for three common mutations of genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 by means of heteroduplex analysis. The mutation 5382insC in exon 20 of the BRCA1 gene was found in four unrelated patients, including three Slavs and one Ashkenazi Jew, with a positive family history of breast cancer. The mutations 185delAG and 6174delT in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, respectively, which are typical of Ashkenazi Jewish patients with breast cancer, were not found in the patients of either ethnicity living in St. Petersburg, although the 6174delT mutation was found in the control group of Ashkenazi Jews. A new 12-nucleotide duplication g.71741ins12nt found in intron 20 of the BRCA1 gene was described. The high frequency of the 5382insC mutation in the BRCA1 gene in patients with familial breast cancer in both St. Petersburg and Moscow indicates that Russian families with the history of breast cancer should be primarily tested for this mutation.
11109172	Primary ovarian dysgerminoma in a patient with a germline BRCA1 mutation.	Germline mutations in the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene are associated with increased risk for the development of ovarian cancer. All such cancers thus far reported have been of the epithelial histologic type. We identified an ovarian dysgerminoma in a 16-year-old woman (proband) with a family history of ovarian cancer during a review of histopathologic characteristics of ovarian cancers from women enrolled in the Gilda Radner Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry. Mutation analysis of DNA from this patient's peripheral blood leukocytes revealed a germline BRCA1 mutation (3312insG). The mutation was also present in the mother with breast cancer, a maternal aunt and a distant cousin with ovarian cancer, and a maternal grandfather and an uncle with skin cancer. The development of the proband's dysgerminoma may be unrelated to her germline BRCA1 mutation. Alternatively, such dysgerminomas may be caused by BRCA1 mutations, but occur so infrequently compared with epithelial cancers that they are seldom identified. Analysis of a larger series of ovarian germ cell tumors may resolve this question.
11314036	Searching for microsatellite mutations in coding regions in lung, breast, ovarian and colorectal cancers.	RepX represents a new informatics approach to probe the UniGene database for potentially polymorphic repeat sequences in the open reading frame (ORF) of genes, 56% of which were found to be actually polymorphic. We now have performed mutational analysis of 17 such sites in genes not found to be polymorphic (<0.03 frequency) in a large panel of human cancer genomic DNAs derived from 31 lung, 21 breast, seven ovarian, 21 (13 microsatellite instability (MSI)+ and eight MSI-) colorectal cancer cell lines. In the lung, breast and ovarian tumor DNAs we found no mutations (<0.03-0.04 rate of tumor associated open reading frame mutations) in these sequences. By contrast, 18 MSI+ colorectal cancers (13 cancer cell lines and five primary tumors) with mismatch repair defects exhibited six mutations in three of the 17 genes (SREBP-2, TAN-1, GR6) (P<0.000003 compared to all other cancers tested). We conclude that coding region microsatellite alterations are rare in lung, breast, ovarian carcinomas and MSI (-) colorectal cancers, but are relatively frequent in MSI (+) colorectal cancers with mismatch repair deficits.
11505617	[Bilateral breast carcinoma and local recurrence: prevalence of BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 gene mutations in an unselected patient sample].	BACKGROUND: Mutations of the BRCA 1/BRCA 2 genes strongly predispose towards the development of contralateral breast cancer. We therefore investigated a hospital-based series of patients with bilateral breast cancer and a comparison group of patients with unilateral breast cancer, pairwise matched by age and family history, for mutations of the BRCA 1/BRCA 2 genes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1995 and 2000 genomic DNA from blood samples of 75 patients with bilateral breast cancer, who received postoperative radiotherapy, was analyzed for mutations of all coding regions and flanking intron sequences of the BRCA 1/BRCA 2 genes by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP) and sequencing of aberrant findings. The results were compared to 75 unilateral breast cancer patients who were screened for common mutations in the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes. Treatment results of patients with bilateral disease were analyzed with regard to a possible carriership of a BRCA 1/BRCA 2 gene mutation. RESULTS: Five distinct frameshift deletions (one in BRCA 1, four in BRCA 2) were identified in six patients with bilateral breast cancer. Three of six carriers developed local relapse, whereas this was the case in only nine of 69 non-carriers. After radiotherapy local relapse occurred in five patients (five of 126 irradiated breasts or chest walls). Three of these patients (60%) were carriers of a pathogenic BRCA 1/BRCA 2 mutation. In the comparison group of patients with unilateral breast cancer three pathogenic BRCA 1 mutations were identified. CONCLUSIONS: We failed to confirm an increased prevalence of BRCA 1/BRCA 2 mutations in our hospital-based series of patients with bilateral breast cancer. However, local relapse, especially when occurring after radiotherapy, may be predictive for an underlying pathogenic BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene mutation in patients with bilateral breast cancer.
11550149	Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 13q12-q14, BRCA-2 mutations and lack of BRCA-2 promoter hypermethylation in sporadic epithelial ovarian tumors.	BACKGROUND: BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 are tumor suppressor genes in familial breast-ovarian carcinoma syndrome. BRCA-1 is also a tumor suppressor gene in sporadic ovarian carcinomas. However, the role of BRCA-2 in sporadic ovarian tumors remains unclear. METHODS: DNA from 52 patients with clinically apparent sporadic ovarian tumors was extracted from blood and from fresh-frozen tumor tissue and normal tissue (10 benign, 7 borderline, and 35 malignant). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was analyzed in six microsatellite loci on chromosome 13q. BRCA-2 mutations were detected by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and the protein truncation test. BRCA-2 promoter methylation was evaluated by methylation specific polymerase chain reaction analysis. RESULTS: LOH on chromosome 13q12-q14 was identified in 16 tumors (30.8%): Fifteen of these tumors were carcinomas (15 of 35 tumors; 42.8%) and one was a borderline tumor. LOH was frequent in carcinomas with serous differentiation (12 of 16 tumors; 75%). LOH on chromosome 13q12-q14 coexisted with LOH on chromosome 17q in 10 carcinomas. BRCA-2 methylation was not detected in any tumor. BRCA-2 mutations were found in three tumors (one somatic nonsense and two germline frameshift). BRCA-2 fulfilled the two hits for a tumor suppressor gene in these three tumors; in one of them, a BRCA-1 tumor suppressor role had been demonstrated previously. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 may act synergically in sporadic ovarian carcinomas with serous differentiation. The demonstration of BRCA-2 germline mutations in patients with ovarian carcinoma with LOH on chromosome 13q12-q14 and lack of a remarkable family history of cancer suggest that the proportion of ovarian carcinomas that result from hereditary predisposition may be higher than previously estimated.
12023992	Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy in women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.	BACKGROUND: Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy is often considered by carriers of BRCA mutations who have completed childbearing. However, there are limited data supporting the efficacy of this approach. We prospectively compared the effect of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy with that of surveillance for ovarian cancer on the incidence of subsequent breast cancer and BRCA-related gynecologic cancers in women with BRCA mutations. METHODS: All women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations identified during a six-year period were offered enrollment in a prospective follow-up study. A total of 170 women 35 years of age or older who had not undergone bilateral oophorectomy chose to undergo either surveillance for ovarian cancer or risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy. Follow-up involved an annual questionnaire, telephone contact, and reviews of medical records. The time to cancer in the two groups was compared by Kaplan-Meier analysis and a Cox proportional-hazards model. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 24.2 months, breast cancer was diagnosed in 3 of the 98 women who chose risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy and peritoneal cancer was diagnosed in 1 woman in this group. Among the 72 women who chose surveillance, breast cancer was diagnosed in 8, ovarian cancer in 4, and peritoneal cancer in 1. The time to breast cancer or BRCA-related gynecologic cancer was longer in the salpingo-oophorectomy group, with a hazard ratio for subsequent breast cancer or BRCA-related gynecologic cancer of 0.25 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.08 to 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: Salpingo-oophorectomy in carriers of BRCA mutations can decrease the risk of breast cancer and BRCA-related gynecologic cancer.
8276294	Assessment of primary and metastatic ovarian cancer by positron emission tomography (PET) using 2-[18F]deoxyglucose (2-[18F]FDG).	"The potential of positron emission tomography (PET) to distinguish benign from malignant ovarian tissue was evaluated by comparing the results of F-18 fluoro-2-D-deoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) PET scans with computed tomography and surgical findings. If sufficiently sensitive, this method might play a role in localizing metabolically active tumor sites for diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of ovarian cancer. Fifty-one patients had imaging studies prior to laparotomy for suspected ovarian cancer. PET scans were done with an ECAT 931-08-12 or ECAT EXACT (Model 921, Siemens/CTI, Knoxville, TN) after iv injection of 185-370 MBq of F-18-FDG. (ECAT is a trade name for ""emission computerized axial tomograph."") Data were acquired in dynamic scanning mode and time activity curves (TACs) were evaluated in multiple regions of interest identified by visual interpretation of the PET scans. Scan interpretation, standardized uptake values, and TAC profiles were related to surgical and histological findings. The results of this pilot study show good correlation between PET and histological findings. The positive predictive value of PET for ovarian cancer was 86% and, perhaps more important, the negative predictive value was 76%. This early work indicates that PET may be useful in the management of patients with ovarian neoplasms by identifying occult foci of metabolically active tumor that do not appear on morphological studies."
8988179	Variation of risks of breast and ovarian cancer associated with different germline mutations of the BRCA2 gene.	The breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2 on chromosome 13q12-13 has recently been identified. Germline mutations of BRCA2 are predicted to account for approximately 35% of families with multiple case, early onset female breast cancer, and they are also associated with an increased risk of male breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer. Germline mutations of a second cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 (ref. 5), are associated with a strong predisposition to ovarian cancer as well as female breast cancer. Recent studies have suggested that the phenotype in BRCA1 families with respect to the ratio of breast to ovarian cancer varies with the location of the BRCA1 mutation. To determine whether germline mutations in BRCA2 are associated with a similar variation in phenotypic risk, we have analysed the distribution of mutations in 25 families with multiple cases of breast and/or ovarian cancer ascertained in the United Kingdom and Eire. These mutations all lead to premature truncation of BRCA2 as a result of frameshift deletions/insertions or nonsense mutations. Analysis of the mutation distribution along the length of the gene indicates a significant genotype-phenotype correlation. Truncating mutations in families with the highest risk of ovarian cancer relative to breast cancer are clustered in a region of approximately 3.3 kb in exon 11 (P = 0.0004). Published data on mutations in 45 other BRCA2-linked families provide support for this correlation.
9743298	Absence of 185delAG mutation of the BRCA1 gene and 6174delT mutation of the BRCA2 gene in Ashkenazi Jewish men with prostate cancer.	Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a clustering of breast and prostate cancers in some families. Moreover, there is an increase in the number of cases of prostate cancer in families with inherited mutations of the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1. We assessed the role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in prostate cancer. We tested for the BRCA1 185delAG frameshift mutation, found in 0.9% of Ashkenazi Jews, and the BRCA2 6174delT mutation, found in 1% of Ashkenazi Jews, in Ashkenazi Jewish men with prostate cancer. We studied 60 Ashkenazi men with prostate cancer. A family history was obtained by interview or a self-report questionnaire. Histological confirmation of diagnosis was obtained for all subjects. Ethnic background was confirmed for all subjects by self-report or interview. Mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were detected by amplification of lymphocyte DNA from peripheral blood according to standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and dot blot procedures. Patients' ages ranged from 55 to 80 years (mean +/- s.d. 70 +/- 5.25). There were six men with a family history of prostate cancer; three of these had a father with prostate cancer. Five of the men had a family history of breast cancer, in a mother, a sister or an aunt. None of the men had a family history of both breast and prostate cancer. None of the 60 men carried the 185delAG BRCA1 or 6174delT BRCA2 mutations. Of 268 Ashkenazi Jewish women with sporadic breast cancer, tested in an unrelated study, 16 carried either the 185delAG mutation of BRCA1 or the 6174delT mutation of BRCA2. There was a significant difference in the incidence of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in the breast and prostate cancer cases (P = 0.05, two-tailed Fisher's exact test). The contribution of germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations to prostate cancer incidence is probably small and could be limited to specific subgroups.
12894890	Study of BRCA1 gene in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.	"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the BRCA1 gene in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, early-onset breast cancer and sporadic ovarian cancer. METHODS: The exons of 2, 11 and 20 of BRCA1 gene were analyzed. Polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation analysis (PCR-SSCP) and PCR-SSCP combined by restriction enzymes were used to screen for mutations. Mutations were further indentified by sequencing. The loss of heterozygosity (LOH) were also investigated at the BRCA1 genetic loci D17S855 in 10 hereditary ovarian cancer. RESULTS: A insertion mutation was detected in H7. ""C"" was inserted at nucleotide 797. It would result in truncation of the BRCA1 protein at codon 277. A missense mutation was detected in an early-onset breast cancer (diagnosed at age 24). At nucleotide position 3732, the substitution of a ""G"" to a ""C"" in codon 1205 changes a Gly to a Arg. A missense mutation were also detected in three sporadic ovarian cancers. At nucleotide position 2051, the substitution of a ""T"" to a ""G"" in codon 644 changes a Cys to a Trp. H3 and H7 patients show LOH. CONCLUSIONS: BRCA1 gene has an important effect in Chinese hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, its effect on early-onset breast cancer and sporadic ovarian cancer are still to be studied. BRCA1 gene is a tumor-suppressor gene."
14658222	[Mutational analysis of breast/ovarian cancer hereditary predisposition gene BRCA1 in Tunisian women].	BRCA1 is a breast cancer susceptibility gene. Germline mutations in BRCA1 gene are found in 5 to 10% of breast cancer. The aim of this study is to screen the tunisian women with familial or sporadic breast cancer for BRCA1 gene mutations. The authors used the Protein Truncation Test (PTT) and DNA sequencing to detect BRCA1 gene mutations in 12 tunisian families with breast cancer and the Allele Specific Oligonucleotide-PCR (ASO-PCR) to detect the 185delAG and 1294del40 mutations in 150 tunisian women with sporadic breast cancer. A nonsens mutation was found, by PTT, in exon 11 of BRCA1 gene in one case of familial breast cancer. No mutation in the rest of exons was found by the DNA sequencing. The BRCA1 1294del40 mutation was found only in a patient with non familial breast cancer. The 185delAG mutation was absent in all cases of breast cancer. These data suggest that the germline mutation of BRCA1 is implicated in breast cancer in Tunisia and that the 185delAG mutation is absent in arab tunisian women.
7970706	Transfer of human chromosome 3 to an ovarian carcinoma cell line identifies three regions on 3p involved in ovarian cancer.	The molecular pathogenesis of ovarian carcinoma involves altered expression of growth factors, activation of oncogenes and loss of tumor suppressor genes. Loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 3p, 6q, 11p, 17 and 18q was reported as a significant alteration in ovarian cancer. However, no functional proof has been provided of tumor suppressor activity located in these chromosomal regions. We therefore introduced normal human chromosomes 3 and 11 into an ovarian carcinoma cell line by microcell mediated chromosome transfer. Transfer of chromosome 3 induced senescence and growth arrest as well as suppression of tumorigenicity. Tumors induced by chromosome 3 monochromosomic hybrids consistently lost three small regions on 3p, two of which located in 3p23-24.2 and one located in 3p21.1-21.2, suggesting that these chromosomal regions are important for suppression of tumorigenicity of ovarian carcinoma cells. Transfer of chromosome 11 reduced the in vitro growth properties of ovarian cancer cells but did not significantly affect tumorigenicity. These results provide functional evidence for chromosome 3 tumor suppressor activity in ovarian cancer and define the chromosomal regions on 3p involved in the pathogenesis of this tumor. This experimental system, based on functional effects, may be useful for further delimitation and isolation of critical regions on 3p involved in tumor suppression.
8181580	Times and sites of relapses after negative second look in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.	In the present work the Authors analyse the role and significance of second-look laparotomy in the management of epithelial ovarian cancer. Eighty-three patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (stage III-IV) followed at the Institutes of Gynecology of Padua and Pisa Universities underwent a negative second-look at a median time of 6 months after first surgery. The incidence of relapse after the negative second-look was 45.8% and the mean time of relapse was 27.4 months. Advanced surgical-pathological stage, the presence of residual disease > 2 cm and serous histotype are risk factors for relapse after a negative second-look. These data confirm that, because of its poor prognostic value, a negative second-look laparotomy should not influence the choice of second line chemotherapy and, consequently is no longer routinely performed in our Institutes.
11139251	Prevalence of BRCA1 founder mutations in western Poland.	The frequency of three BRCA1 founder mutations was examined in a group of Polish breast/ovarian cancer patients and women at increased risk of these cancers based on family history. Among the 15 mutations found (5385-5386insC, 187-188delAG, and 4154delA), eight were detected in women with a low or moderate family history. The frequency of the IVS20+48ins12 variant was also analyzed and its distribution within risk groups argues against its involvement in cancer predisposition.
10634513	BRCA1 mutation testing for Japanese patients with ovarian cancer in breast cancer screening.	From February 1996 to April 1998, 2967 women received screening for breast cancer in the gynecologic ambulatory practice of the Hokkaido University Hospital. In 116 Japanese women with epithelial ovarian cancer, mutation analysis of BRCA1 exon 11 in genomic DNA was performed by the stop codon (SC) assay and DNA sequence analysis. Clinicopathological factors were also investigated in these patients. The aim of this study was to examine the advantages of performing BRCA1 mutation testing for ovarian cancer patients during breast cancer screening. We achieved a high detection rate (6.0%) of patients with germline mutations in BRCA1. The high frequencies of breast ovarian cancer syndrome, serous adenocarcinoma, high histological grades, advanced FIGO stages, and breast cancer as double cancer were found to be characteristic of ovarian cancer with germline mutations in BRCA1. These characteristics may assist physicians in selecting BRCA1 mutation testing for ovarian cancer patients. The mean age at diagnosis of ovarian cancer was 51.0 and 51.2 years in the groups with and without mutation, respectively, and no difference was found in age at diagnosis. All of the nine living female mutation carriers were offered the options of increased surveillance or prophylactic surgery, and all chose the former. We have performed breast cancer screening and/or ovarian cancer screening every 6 months for these carriers. This may allow another advantage in establishing a relationship of mutual trust with a patient from a series of responsible follow-ups.
10910057	Mice heterozygous for a Brca1 or Brca2 mutation display distinct mammary gland and ovarian phenotypes in response to diethylstilbestrol.	Women who inherit mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are predisposed to the development of breast and ovarian cancer. We used mice with a Brca1 mutation on a BALB/cJ inbred background (BALB/cB1+/- mice) or a Brca2 genetic alteration on the 129/SvEv genetic background (129B2+/- mice) to investigate potential gene-environment interactions between defects in these genes and treatment with the highly estrogenic compound diethylstilbestrol (DES). Beginning at 3 weeks of age, BALB/cB1+/-, 129B2+/-, and wild-type female mice were fed a control diet or a diet containing 640 ppb DES for 26 weeks. DES treatment caused vaginal epithelial hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis, uterine inflammation, adenomyosis, and fibrosis, as well as oviductal smooth muscle hypertrophy. The severity of the DES response was mouse strain specific. The estrogen-responsive 129/SvEv strain exhibited an extreme response in the reproductive tract, whereas the effect in BALB/cJ and C3H/HeN(MMTV-) mice was less severe. The Brca1 and Brca2 genetic alterations influenced the phenotypic response of BALB/cJ and 129/SvEv inbred strains, respectively, to DES in the mammary gland and ovary. The mammary duct branching morphology was inhibited in DES-treated BALB/cB1+/- mice compared with similarly treated BALB/cB1+/+ littermates. In addition, the majority of BALB/cB1+/- mice had atrophied ovaries, whereas wild-type littermates were largely diagnosed with arrested follicular development. The mammary ductal architecture in untreated 129B2+/- mice revealed a subtle inhibited branching phenotype that was enhanced with DES treatment. However, no significant differences were observed in ovarian pathology between 129B2+/+ and 129B2+/- mice. These data suggest that estrogenic compounds may modulate mammary gland or ovarian morphology in BALB/cB1+/- and 129B2+/- mice. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that compromised DNA repair processes in cells harboring Brca1 or Brca2 mutations lead to inhibited growth and differentiation compared with the proliferative response of wild-type cells to DES treatment.
10945492	The rate of the founder Jewish mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in prostate cancer patients in Israel.	Inherited predisposition occurs in 5-10% of all prostate cancer (CaP) patients, but the genes involved in conferring genetic susceptibility remain largely unknown. Several lines of evidence indicate that germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 might be associated with an increased risk for CaP. Three mutations in these two genes (185delAG and 5382InsC (BRCA1) and 6174delT (BRCA2) occur in about 2.5% of the general Ashkenazi population, and the 185delAG BRCA1 mutation, in up to 1% of non-Ashkenazi Jews. In order to assess the contribution of these germline mutations to prostate cancer in Jewish Israeli patients, we tested 174 unselected prostate cancer patients (95 of Ashkenazi origin) for these mutations by PCR amplification and modified restriction enzyme digests. Patient's age range was 45-81 years (median 66), and in 24 (14.4%) the disease was diagnosed prior to 55 years of age. Nineteen (11%) and 12 (6.9%) patients had a first or second degree relative with CaP or breast cancer, respectively. Overall, five mutation carriers were detected: 2/152 (1.3%) 185delAG, 2/104 (2%) 5382InsC, and 1/158 (0.6%) 6174delT. In all carriers, the disease was diagnosed after the age of 55, and only one of them had a family history of breast and CaP. In addition, no allelic losses at the BRCA1 locus were demonstrated in 17 patients with a family history of CaP, using seven microsatellite markers. We conclude that the rate of the predominant Jewish BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in CaP patients does not significantly differ from that of the general population, and that mutational inactivation of the BRCA1 is rare in familial CaP. Thus, germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations probably contribute little to CaP occurrence, to inherited predisposition, and to early onset disease in Jewish individuals.
12543786	BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status and tumor characteristics in male breast cancer: a population-based study in Italy.	To investigate at the population level the impact of BRCA1/BRCA2 gene alterations in male breast cancer, we analyzed a population-based series of 25 male breast cancer cases from Florence, Central Italy. We combined mutational screening with the study of germ-line allele transcript levels and of tumor-associated losses of heterozygosity. Screening by protein truncation test and single-strand conformational polymorphism assay, followed by sequencing, revealed 4 pathogenetic mutations (4 of 25 = 16%; 95% confidence interval, 5-37%), 1 in BRCA1 and 3 in BRCA2, including mutations recurring in Central Italy (BRCA1 3345delAG and BRCA2 6696delTC). The a priori probability of carrying a mutation, estimated using BRCAPRO software, showed a good agreement between expected and observed mutations (14% versus 16%). A 7-fold association between germ-line mutations and family history of breast-ovarian cancer emerged. To investigate associations between BRCA1/BRCA2 status and clinicopathological characteristics, we analyzed the histopathological and immunophenotypic parameters of the tumors. A significant association emerged between mutation carrier status and high histological grade (P = 0.02). Furthermore, one BRCA2 carrier was affected with Paget's disease, an extremely rare male breast cancer histotype. Overall, BRCA1/2 mutations were observed to be strongly associated with positive c-erbB-2 immunostaining (P = 0.004). To evaluate germ-line allele expression, we used primer extension assays targeting frequent BRCA1 and BRCA2 polymorphisms. A BRCA2 allele transcript imbalance was found in one of four heterozygotes tested, all of them negative for germ-line mutations. BRCA1 transcript imbalances were not detected in nine heterozygotes analyzed. Losses of heterozygosity at one or more of nine loci in the BRCA2 region were found in 8 of 22 tumors tested. Interestingly, a case that was negative for BRCA1/BRCA2 germ-line mutations and that had a priori mutation probability <10% showed loss of heterozygosity at all three of the intragenic BRCA2 markers analyzed, which could be related to a somatic involvement of BRCA2. No losses of heterozygosity were detected at BRCA1. In conclusion, constitutional BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations accounted for 16% of the male breast cancer cases in this area of Central Italy. The detection of a BRCA2 germ-line transcript imbalance and of a somatic loss of BRCA2 among the cases that resulted negative for germ-line mutations suggests a role of this gene more relevant than indicated by conventional mutational analysis. A distinct pattern of characteristics indicative of aggressive behavior, including high-grade and c-erbB-2 expression, was evident in tumors from germ-line BRCA2 mutation carriers. This suggests that phenotypic characteristics may contribute to the identification of hereditary BRCA2-related male breast cancers and that these tumors might share a unique molecular pathway of cancer progression.
9367693	High frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations in Ashkenazi Jewish ovarian cancer patients, regardless of family history.	To better understand the role of germline BRCA mutations in ovarian cancer in Ashkenazi Jews, we tested 29 consecutive patients admitted to our service for the three mutations common in this ethnic group. These mutations are 185delAG and 5382insC in BRCA1 and 6174delT in BRCA2. Six patients had both breast and ovarian cancer, and 23 had ovarian cancer only. In the first group, all women had germline mutations, 2 with each mutation. Of 23 ovarian cancer patients, 11 were carriers (48%): 6 of 185delAG, 2 of 5382insC, and 3 of 6174delT. Regarding family history, of 13 women with no family history, 3 (23%) were carriers. Of 10 women with any family history of breast or ovarian cancer, 8 (80%) were carriers. We discuss possible explanations for this surprisingly high carrier rate, including a high proportion of familial disease coupled with lack of adequate family history, lower penetrance than previously expected, or increasing penetrance in recent generations due to nongenetic factors. Our data suggest that genetic testing is merited in all Ashkenazi women with ovarian cancer, regardless of family history.
9419789	Messenger RNA decay of macrophage colony-stimulating factor in human ovarian carcinomas in vitro.	OBJECTIVE: Recently, the importance of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1) and its receptor (encoded by the c-fms proto-oncogene) in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer has been recognized. Overexpression of CSF-1 denotes poor prognosis. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor may be one of a group of inflammatory cytokines, whose 3' untranslated region (UTR) contains AU-rich stretches and whose expression may be largely dependent on mRNA decay. The purposes of this study were to investigate the effect of protein synthesis inhibition on CSF-1 transcript expression, to help determine whether there is a role for labile intermediary proteins in the regulation of CSF-1 expression, and to explore the transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms that could underlie such overexpression of CSF-1 transcripts by protein synthesis inhibitors. Although regulation of CSF-1 gene expression has been investigated in hematopoietic cells, such studies have not been carried out in any epithelial cancer. METHODS: Northern blot analyses for CSF-1 expression were performed on total cellular RNA extracted from primary and established ovarian cancer cell lines in the absence or presence of proteins synthesis inhibitors with different modes of action. The probe for the AU-rich exon 10 of CSF-1 was prepared by amplification of the terminal 143 bp of the 3' UTR of human CSF-1 by polymerase chain reaction. Transcription rates were assessed in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (CH) in nuclei of ovarian cancer cells by run-off analyses. The effect of CH on CSF-1 mRNA half-life was measured by actinomycin D chase experiments in SKOV3 cells. RESULTS: We demonstrate that CSF-1 mRNA was expressed by all of a panel of primary and established ovarian cancer cell lines. There are at least three CSF-1 transcripts expressed by ovarian cancer cells; we demonstrate that the 4.2-kb CSF-1 transcript contains exon-6 sequences, which are spliced from the 3.4- and 1.9-kb transcripts, whereas both the 4.2- and 3.4-kb CSF-1 transcripts contain the 3' AU-rich exon 10. Treatment with several different protein synthesis inhibitors resulted in marked overexpression of CSF-1 transcript levels, suggesting a potential role for labile proteins in the regulation of CSF-1 expression. The predominant effect of CH is on the two CSF-1 transcripts that contain exon 10. Although CH does not change the rate of CSF-1 gene transcription, measurement of CSF-1 mRNA stability reveals a prolongation of CSF-1 transcript half-life by CH from 4.5 hours to significantly greater than 6 hours in ovarian cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Augmented CSF-1 transcript stability underlies the marked overexpression of CSF-1 seen with protein synthesis inhibitors. Our results suggest the involvement of a labile regulatory protein that contributes to CSF-1 mRNA decay in ovarian cancer cells. Our data suggest further that exon 10 (not the spliced exon-6 sequences) of the CSF-1 transcript may contain an instability determinant.
10383885	Taxol, vincristine or nocodazole induces lethality in G1-checkpoint-defective human astrocytoma U373MG cells by triggering hyperploid progression.	In this report, we describe a novel lytic mechanism exploited by antimicrotubule drugs (AMDs) such as Taxol which are frequently used to treat multiple human cancers including breast and ovarian cancers. In cells lacking the G1-arresting capacity due to the defect in retinoblastoma or p53 gene function, AMDs trigger hyperploid progression and death. The hyperploid progression occurs via continued cell-cycle progression without cell division. Blocking hyperploid progression through hydroxyurea or ectopically expressed p27(Kip1), a G1-specific Cdk inhibitor, abrogates AMD cytotoxicity. Thus, AMDs induce lethality in G1-checkpoint-defective cells by triggering hyperploid progression. The phenomenon is reminiscent of that observed previously with bub-1 yeast mutant. The potential significance of this finding lies in that hyperploid progression-mediated death may be exploited to develop a therapy with tumor-specificity at the genetic level. As a large fraction of human cancers are mutated in p53 gene, it may have a wide therapeutic applicability.
9382472	Huntingtin localization in brains of normal and Huntington's disease patients.	The immunohistochemical localization of huntingtin was examined in the Huntington's disease (HD) brain with an antibody that recognizes the wild-type and mutant proteins. Neuronal staining was reduced in areas of the HD striatum depleted of medium-sized neurons; large striatal neurons, which are spared in HD, retained normal levels of huntingtin expression. Neuronal labeling was markedly reduced in both segments of the globus pallidus including in brains with minimal loss of pallidal neurons. In some HD cortical and striatal neurons with normal looking morphology, huntingtin was associated with punctate cytoplasmic granules that at the ultrastructural level resembled the multivesicular body, an organelle involved in retrograde transport and protein degradation. Some immunoreactive processes showed blebbing and segmentation similar to that induced experimentally by hypoxic-ischemic or excitotoxic injury. Huntingtin staining was more concentrated in the perinuclear cytoplasm and reduced or absent in processes of atrophic cortical neurons. Nuclear staining was also evident. Fibers in the subcortical white matter of HD patients had significantly increased huntingtin immunoreactivity compared with those of controls. Results suggest that there may be changes in the neuronal expression and transport of wild-type and/or mutant huntingtin at early and late stages of neuronal degeneration in affected areas of the HD brain.
9481240	Multidisciplinary approach to management of a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder: Huntington disease.	Huntington Disease is a well known autosomal dominant inherited disease resulting in emotional problems, abnormalities of movement, and eventually dementia. It stands out as one of the most devastating illnesses, not only for its neurodegenerative progression but also for its impact on families. Care often becomes fragmented due to the person's response to symptoms and/or family breakdown. The successful interaction of health care disciplines working with Huntington Disease in our centers, namely, the family physicians, nursing, Genetics, Neurology, Psychiatry, Social Work, and Long Term Care has resulted in a comprehensive program of care for our patients and their families. This article will describe the history, structure and interaction of the multidisciplinary group. It will describe the difficulties we have overcome and offer suggestions for the implementation of similar programs for the care of people with other disorders.
10632104	Mitochondrial dysfunction and free radical damage in the Huntington R6/2 transgenic mouse.	Huntington's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by an abnormally expanded (>36) CAG repeat within the ITI5 gene encoding a widely expressed 349-kd protein, huntingtin. The medium spiny neurons of the caudate preferentially degenerate in Huntington's disease, with the presence of neuronal intranuclear inclusions. Excitotoxicity is thought to be important in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease; the recently described mitochondrial respiratory chain and aconitase defects in Huntington's disease brain are consistent with this hypothesis. A transgenic mouse model (R6/2) of Huntington's disease develops a movement disorder, muscle wasting, and premature death at about 14 to 16 weeks. Selective neuronal death in these mice is not seen until 14 weeks. Biochemical analysis of R6/2 mouse brain at 12 weeks demonstrated a significant reduction in aconitase and mitochondrial complex IV activities in the striatum and a decrease in complex IV activity in the cerebral cortex. Increased immunostaining for inducible nitric oxide synthase and nitrotyrosine was seen in the transgenic mouse model but not control mouse brains. These results extend the parallels between Huntington's disease and the transgenic mouse model to biochemical events and suggest complex IV deficiency and elevated nitric oxide and superoxide radical generation precede neuronal death in the R6/2 mouse and contribute to pathogenesis.
10699173	Long glutamine tracts cause nuclear localization of a novel form of huntingtin in medium spiny striatal neurons in HdhQ92 and HdhQ111 knock-in mice.	Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expanded N-terminal glutamine tract that endows huntingtin with a striatal-selective structural property ultimately toxic to medium spiny neurons. In precise genetic models of juvenile HD, HdhQ92 and HdhQ111 knock-in mice, long polyglutamine segments change huntingtin's physical properties, producing HD-like in vivo correlates in the striatum, including nuclear localization of a version of the full-length protein predominant in medium spiny neurons, and subsequent formation of N-terminal inclusions and insoluble aggregate. These changes show glutamine length dependence and dominant inheritance with recruitment of wild-type protein, critical features of the altered HD property that strongly implicate them in the HD disease process and that suggest alternative pathogenic scenarios: the effect of the glutamine tract may act by altering interaction with a critical cellular constituent or by depleting a form of huntingtin essential to medium spiny striatal neurons.
10958656	Huntingtin's WW domain partners in Huntington's disease post-mortem brain fulfill genetic criteria for direct involvement in Huntington's disease pathogenesis.	An elongated glutamine tract in mutant huntingtin initiates Huntington's disease (HD) pathogenesis via a novel structural property that displays neuronal selectivity, glutamine progressivity and dominance over the normal protein based on genetic criteria. As this mechanism is likely to involve a deleterious protein interaction, we have assessed the major class of huntingtin interactors comprising three WW domain proteins. These are revealed to be related spliceosome proteins (HYPA/FBP-11 and HYPC) and a transcription factor (HYPB) that implicate huntingtin in mRNA biogenesis. In HD post-mortem brain, specific antibody reagents detect each partner in HD target neurons, in association with disease-related N-terminal morphologic deposits but not with filter trapped insoluble-aggregate. Glutathione S:-transferase partner 'pull-down' assays reveal soluble, aberrantly migrating, forms of full-length mutant huntingtin specific to HD target tissue. Importantly, these novel mutant species exhibit exaggerated WW domain binding that abrogates partner association with other huntingtin isoforms. Thus, each WW domain partner's association with huntingtin fulfills HD genetic criteria, supporting a direct role in pathogenesis. Our findings indicate that modification of mutant huntingtin in target neurons may promote an abnormal interaction with one, or all, of huntingtin's WW domain partners, perhaps altering ribonucleoprotein function with toxic consequences.
11032605	Psychological impact of genetic testing for Huntington's disease: an update of the literature.	Genetic testing has been available for Huntington's disease for longer than any other adult onset genetic disorder. The discovery of the genetic mutation causing Huntington's disease made possible the use of predictive testing to identify currently unaffected carriers. Concerns have been raised that predictive testing may lead to an increase in deaths by suicide among identified carriers, and these concerns set in motion research to assess the psychological impact of predictive testing for Huntington's disease. This review article provides an overview of the literature and draws implications for clinical practice. About 10%-20% of people at risk request testing when approached by registries or testing centres. Most of the evidence suggests that non-carriers and carriers differ significantly in terms of short term, but not long term, general psychological distress. Adjustment to results was found to depend more on psychological adjustment before testing than the testing result itself. Although risk factors for psychological sequelae have been identified, few adverse events have been described and no obvious contraindications for testing people at risk have been identified. The psychological impact of testing may depend on whether testing was based on linkage analysis or mutation detection. Cohorts enrolled in mutation detection programmes have higher levels of depression before and after testing, compared with people who sought genetic testing when linkage analysis was available. There is evidence that people who choose to be tested are psychologically selected for a favourable response to testing. The impact of testing on people in settings where less intensive counselling protocols and eligibility criteria are used is unknown, and genetic testing is therefore best offered as part of comprehensive specialist counselling.
11232352	George Huntington (1850-1916) and hereditary chorea.	Although Huntington's disease has existed since at least the seventeenth century, and although several physicians provided earlier descriptions of hereditary chorea, Huntington's disease was not generally recognized until the classic description by George Huntington (1850-1916) in 1872. This paper--on the sesquicentennial of Huntington's birth--reviews Huntington's original and later contributions to the description of this disorder, his professional presentations and correspondence on the topic, and his publications, as well as his background, medical training, and clinical practice. The characteristics of Huntington's disease recognized by George Huntington in 1872--i.e., the distinct clinical profile, midlife onset, and autosomal dominant inheritance pattern--made the disease ideal for investigation by genetic linkage analysis a century after Huntington's description. Subsequent breakthroughs have identified the genetic defect as an unstable expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat mutation in a novel gene on the short arm of chromosome 4. The rapidity of recent discoveries bodes well for further significant progress in understanding, and hopefully treating, this profoundly debilitating neurodegenerative disorder.
11517213	HIP1 functions in clathrin-mediated endocytosis through binding to clathrin and adaptor protein 2.	Polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin is the underlying mutation leading to neurodegeneration in Huntington disease. This mutation influences the interaction of huntingtin with different proteins, including huntingtin-interacting protein 1 (HIP1), in which affinity to bind to mutant huntingtin is profoundly reduced. Here we demonstrate that HIP1 colocalizes with markers of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in neuronal cells and is highly enriched on clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) purified from brain homogenates. HIP1 binds to the clathrin adaptor protein 2 (AP2) and the terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain, predominantly through a small fragment encompassing amino acids 276-335. This region, which contains consensus clathrin- and AP2-binding sites, functions in conjunction with the coiled-coil domain to target HIP1 to CCVs. Expression of various HIP1 fragments leads to a potent block of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Our findings demonstrate that HIP1 is a novel component of the endocytic machinery.
11600884	Mutant protein in Huntington disease is resistant to proteolysis in affected brain.	The cause of Huntington disease pathophysiology is unknown, but a major hypothesis suggests that toxicity arises from the cleavage and accumulation of amino-terminal fragments containing an expanded polyglutamine region. In evaluating huntingtin protein (HD) from human brain, transgenic animals and cells, we observed, unexpectedly, that mutant HD is more resistant to proteolysis than normal HD. The N-terminal cleavage fragments we observed arise from the processing of normal HD and are sequestered by full-length mutant HD. Our results support a model in which inhibition of proteolysis of mutant HD leads to aggregation and toxicity through the sequestering of important targets, including normal HD.
11733534	Expression of full-length polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin disrupts growth factor receptor signaling in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells.	We reported previously that normal Huntingtin is associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF) signaling complex (Liu, Y. F., Deth, C. R., and Devys, D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 8121-8124). To investigate the potential role of normal and polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin in the regulation of growth factor receptor-mediated cellular signaling and biological function, we stably transfected full-length Huntingtin containing 16, 48, or 89 polyglutamine repeats into PC12 cells where cellular signaling mechanisms, mediated by nerve growth factor (NGF) or EGF receptors, are well characterized. Expression of polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin, but not normal Huntingtin, leads to a dramatic morphological change. In clones carrying the mutated Huntingtin, both NGF and EGF receptor-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and Akt are significantly attenuated, and NGF receptor-mediated neurite outgrowth is blocked. Co-immunoprecipitation studies show that the associations of NGF or EGF receptors with growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 (Grb2) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase are significantly inhibited. NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of NGF receptors (TrkA) is also consistently suppressed. Our data demonstrate that polyglutamine-expanded Huntingtin disrupts cellular signaling mediated by both EGF and NGF receptors in PC12 cells. It is known that Huntington's disease patients exhibit an extremely low incidence of a variety of cancers and are deficient in glucose metabolism. Thus, our results may reflect an important molecular mechanism for the pathogenesis of the disease.
11738471	Does tissue transglutaminase play a role in Huntington's disease?	Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) likely plays a role in numerous processes in the nervous system. tTG posttranslationally modifies proteins by transamidation of specific polypeptide bound glutamines (Glns). This reaction results in the incorporation of polyamines into substrate proteins or the formation of protein crosslinks, modifications that likely have significant effects on neural function. Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine domain in the huntingtin protein. Because a polypeptide bound Gln is the determining factor for a tTG substrate, and mutant huntingtin aggregates have been found in Huntington's disease brain, it has been hypothesized that tTG may contribute to the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease. In vitro, polyglutamine constructs and huntingtin are substrates of tTG. Further, the levels of tTG and TG activity are elevated in Huntington's disease brain and immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated that there is an increase in tTG reactivity in affected neurons in Huntington's disease. These findings suggest that tTG may play a role in Huntington's disease. However in situ, neither wild type nor mutant huntingtin is modified by tTG. Further, immunocytochemical analysis revealed that tTG is totally excluded from the huntingtin aggregates, and modulation of the expression level of tTG had no effect on the frequency of the aggregates in the cells. Therefore, tTG is not required for the formation of huntingtin aggregates, and likely does not play a role in this process in Huntington's disease brain. However, tTG interacts with truncated huntingtin, and selectively polyaminates proteins that are associated with mutant truncated huntingtin. Given the fact that the levels of polyamines in cells is in the millimolar range and the crosslinking and polyaminating reactions catalyzed by tTG are competing reactions, intracellularly polyamination is likely to be the predominant reaction. Polyamination of proteins is likely to effect their function, and therefore it can be hypothesized that tTG may play a role in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease by modifying specific proteins and altering their function and/or localization. Further research is required to define the specific role of tTG in Huntington's disease.
12062094	The IGF-1/Akt pathway is neuroprotective in Huntington's disease and involves Huntingtin phosphorylation by Akt.	In the search for neuroprotective factors in Huntington's disease, we found that insulin growth factor 1 via activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB is able to inhibit neuronal death specifically induced by mutant huntingtin containing an expanded polyglutamine stretch. The IGF-1/Akt pathway has a dual effect on huntingtin-induced toxicity, since activation of this pathway also results in a decrease in the formation of intranuclear inclusions of mutant huntingtin. We demonstrate that huntingtin is a substrate of Akt and that phosphorylation of huntingtin by Akt is crucial to mediate the neuroprotective effects of IGF-1. Finally, we show that Akt is altered in Huntington's disease patients. Taken together, these results support a potential role of the Akt pathway in Huntington's disease.
12135980	Impaired glutamate transport and glutamate-glutamine cycling: downstream effects of the Huntington mutation.	The pathogenesis of Huntington's disease is still not completely understood. Several lines of evidence from toxic/non-transgenic animal models of Huntington's disease suggest that excitotoxic mechanisms may contribute to the pathological phenotype. Evidence from transgenic animal models of Huntington's disease, however, is sparse. To explore potential alterations in brain glutamate handling we studied transgenic mice expressing an N-terminal fragment of mutant huntingtin (R6/2). Intracerebral microdialysis in freely moving mice showed similar extracellular glutamate levels in R6/2 and littermate controls. However, partial inhibition of glutamate transport by L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (4 mM) disclosed an age-dependent increase in extracellular glutamate levels in R6/2 mice compared with controls, consistent with a reduction of functional glutamate transport capacity. Biochemical studies demonstrated an age-dependent downregulation of the glial glutamate transporter GLT-1 mRNA and protein, resulting in a progressive reduction of transporter function. Glutamate transporters other than GLT-1 were unchanged. In addition, increased extracellular glutamine levels and alterations to glutamine synthetase immunoreactivity suggested a perturbation of the glutamate-glutamine cycle. These findings demonstrate that the Huntington's disease mutation results in a progressively deranged glutamate handling in the brain, beginning before the onset of symptoms in mice. They also provide evidence for a contribution of excitotoxicity to the pathophysiology of Huntington's disease, and thus Huntington's disease may be added to the growing list of neurodegenerative disorders associated with compromised glutamate transport capacity.
12200414	Calcium-dependent cleavage of endogenous wild-type huntingtin in primary cortical neurons.	Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the amino-terminal region of huntingtin. Mutant huntingtin is proteolytically cleaved by caspases, generating amino-terminal aggregates that are toxic for cells. The addition of calpains to total brain homogenates also leads to cleavage of wild-type huntingtin, indicating that proteolysis of mutant and wild-type huntingtin may play a role in HD. Here we report that endogenous wild-type huntingtin is promptly cleaved by calpains in primary neurons. Exposure of primary neurons to glutamate or 3-nitropropionic acid increases intracellular calcium concentration, leading to loss of intact full-length wild-type huntingtin. This cleavage could be prevented by calcium chelators and calpain inhibitors. Degradation of wild-type huntingtin by calcium-dependent proteases thus occurs in HD neurons, leading to loss of wild-type huntingtin neuroprotective activity.
12548365	Cognitive and psychiatric characterization of patients with Huntington's disease and their at-risk relatives.	We examined cognitive and psychiatric disturbances in patients with Huntington's disease (HD) in comparison to at-risk asymptomatic subjects. Cognitive and psychiatric scales and an HD motor scale were administered to 40 HD patients, 17 pre-symptomatic HD gene carriers (AR+) and 28 non gene carriers (AR-). HD patients did worse than AR+ and AR- in all motor, cognitive and psychiatric measures, while AR+ and AR-subjects did not differ between each other. HD patients had high scores for negative psychiatric symptoms, but there was no correlation between illness duration and psychiatric or cognitive performance. In HD, disease course and symptomatology are heterogeneous and negative psychiatric symptoms are common.
12711212	Transcriptional abnormalities in Huntington disease.	Huntington disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion that is translated into an abnormally long polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the huntingtin protein. The precise mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration in HD have not been fully elucidated, but alterations in gene transcription could well be involved because the activities of several nuclear proteins are compromised by the polyQ mutation. Recent microarray studies also show relevant changes in gene expression profiles in HD models, providing useful information on the potential consequences of disrupted transcriptional pathways in HD.
12881722	Huntingtin interacts with REST/NRSF to modulate the transcription of NRSE-controlled neuronal genes.	Huntingtin protein is mutated in Huntington disease. We previously reported that wild-type but not mutant huntingtin stimulates transcription of the gene encoding brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; ref. 2). Here we show that the neuron restrictive silencer element (NRSE) is the target of wild-type huntingtin activity on BDNF promoter II. Wild-type huntingtin inhibits the silencing activity of NRSE, increasing transcription of BDNF. We show that this effect occurs through cytoplasmic sequestering of repressor element-1 transcription factor/neuron restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF), the transcription factor that binds to NRSE. In contrast, aberrant accumulation of REST/NRSF in the nucleus is present in Huntington disease. We show that wild-type huntingtin coimmunoprecipitates with REST/NRSF and that less immunoprecipitated material is found in brain tissue with Huntington disease. We also report that wild-type huntingtin acts as a positive transcriptional regulator for other NRSE-containing genes involved in the maintenance of the neuronal phenotype. Consistently, loss of expression of NRSE-controlled neuronal genes is shown in cells, mice and human brain with Huntington disease. We conclude that wild-type huntingtin acts in the cytoplasm of neurons to regulate the availability of REST/NRSF to its nuclear NRSE-binding site and that this control is lost in the pathology of Huntington disease. These data identify a new mechanism by which mutation of huntingtin causes loss of transcription of neuronal genes.
12890790	Lack of huntingtin-associated protein-1 causes neuronal death resembling hypothalamic degeneration in Huntington's disease.	Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the disease protein huntingtin. The polyglutamine expansion causes huntingtin to interact abnormally with a number of proteins. However, it is unclear whether, and how, huntingtin-associated proteins are involved in the neurodegeneration in HD. Here, we show that huntingtin-associated protein-1 (HAP1), which is involved in intracellular trafficking of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is highly expressed in the hypothalamus. Mice lacking HAP1 die after birth because of depressed feeding activity. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling staining and electron microscopic examination revealed the degeneration in hypothalamic regions that control feeding behavior. Hypothalamic degeneration was also observed in HD transgenic mice that have a significant loss of body weight. Inhibition of HAP1 expression decreases EGFR signaling and cell viability, whereas overexpression of HAP1 enhances this signaling activity and inhibits mutant huntingtin-mediated cytotoxicity. These results suggest that the effect of mutant huntingtin on HAP1 and EGFR signaling may contribute to the hypothalamic neurodegeneration and loss of body weight in HD.
14557250	Huntingtin forms toxic NH2-terminal fragment complexes that are promoted by the age-dependent decrease in proteasome activity.	Although NH2-terminal mutant huntingtin (htt) fragments cause neurological disorders in Huntington's disease (HD), it is unclear how toxic htt fragments are generated and contribute to the disease process. Here, we report that complex NH2-terminal mutant htt fragments smaller than the first 508 amino acids were generated in htt-transfected cells and HD knockin mouse brains. These fragments constituted neuronal nuclear inclusions and appeared before neurological symptoms. The accumulation and aggregation of these htt fragments were associated with an age-dependent decrease in proteasome activity and were promoted by inhibition of proteasome activity. These results suggest that decreased proteasome activity contributes to late onset htt toxicity and that restoring the ability to remove NH2-terminal fragments will provide a more effective therapy for HD than inhibiting their production.
8544189	Analysis of triplet repeats in the huntingtin gene in Japanese families affected with Huntington's disease.	Huntington's disease (HD) is associated with the expansion of a CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene. Molecular analysis of the repeat in Japanese HD patients and normal controls was performed. The size of the CAG repeat ranged from 37 to 95 repeats in affected subjects and from seven to 29 in normal controls. A significant correlation was found between the age of onset and the CAG expansion. The length of the expanded repeat is unstable in meiotic transmission and large increases occur in paternal transmission. At the same time the CCG repeat polymorphism adjacent to the CAG repeat was analysed and haplotypes of HD chromosomes were identified. Strong linkage disequilibrium was found between the CAG repeat expansion and an allele of (CCG)10 in Japanese HD chromosomes. It is distinct from that described previously in western populations. Western HD chromosomes strongly associate with an allele of (CCG)7. Possible mechanisms underlying the disequilibrium in Japan are discussed.
8937828	Huntington's disease: translating a CAG repeat into a pathogenic mechanism.	The specific pattern of neuronal cell death in Huntington's disease (HD) is triggered by an abnormal version of the huntingtin protein, which is produced by translation of the HD gene defect, an expanded CAG repeat in a novel 4p16.3 gene. The extended amino-terminal polyglutamine segment may act via the protein's inherent activity, increasing it or decreasing it in a graded fashion, or, alternatively, it may confer the ability to interact with a completely different set of cellular pathways, focusing attention on the HD protein's normal and abnormal physiological functions.
9682010	Wild-type and mutant huntingtins function in vesicle trafficking in the secretory and endocytic pathways.	Huntingtin is a cytoplasmic protein that is found in neurons and somatic cells. In patients with Huntington's disease (HD), the NH2-terminal region of huntingtin has an expanded polyglutamine tract. An abnormal protein interaction by mutant huntingtin has been proposed as a mechanism for HD pathogenesis. Huntingtin associates with vesicle membranes and interacts with proteins involved in vesicle trafficking. It is unclear where along vesicle transport pathways wild-type and mutant huntingtins are found and whether polyglutamine expansion affects this localization. To distinguish wild-type and mutant huntingtin, fibroblasts from normals and HD patients with two mutant alleles (homozygotes) were examined. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy showed that mutant huntingtin localized with clathrin in membranes of the trans Golgi network and in clathrin-coated and noncoated endosomal vesicles in the cytoplasm and along plasma membranes. Separation of organelles in Nycodenz gradients showed that in normal and HD homozygote patient cells, huntingtin was present in membrane fractions enriched in clathrin. Similar results were obtained in fibroblasts from heterozyote juvenile HD patients who had a highly expanded polyglutamine tract in the HD allele. Western blot analysis of membrane fractions from rat brain showed that wild-type huntingtin was present in fractions that contained purified clathrin-coated membranes or a mixture of clathrin-coated and noncoated membranes. Electron microscopy of huntingtin immunoreactivity in rat brain revealed labeling along dendritic plasma membranes in association with clathrin-coated pits and clusters of noncoated endosomal vesicles 40-60 nm in diameter. These data suggest that wild-type and mutant huntingtin can influence vesicle transport in the secretory and endocytic pathways through associations with clathrin-coated vesicles.
9778247	Huntingtin acts in the nucleus to induce apoptosis but death does not correlate with the formation of intranuclear inclusions.	The mechanisms by which mutant huntingtin induces neurodegeneration were investigated using a cellular model that recapitulates features of neurodegeneration seen in Huntington's disease. When transfected into cultured striatal neurons, mutant huntingtin induces neurodegeneration by an apoptotic mechanism. Antiapoptotic compounds or neurotrophic factors protected neurons against mutant huntingtin. Blocking nuclear localization of mutant huntingtin suppressed its ability to form intranuclear inclusions and to induce neurodegeneration. However, the presence of inclusions did not correlate with huntingtin-induced death. The exposure of mutant huntingtin-transfected striatal neurons to conditions that suppress the formation of inclusions resulted in an increase in mutant huntingtin-induced death. These findings suggest that mutant huntingtin acts within the nucleus to induce neurodegeneration. However, intranuclear inclusions may reflect a cellular mechanism to protect against huntingtin-induced cell death.
9863360	[Importance of the number of trinucleotide repeat expansions in the clinical manifestations of Huntington's chorea].	"INTRODUCTION: In 1993 the gene responsible for Huntington's disease (IT15) was isolated [5]. It was mapped to the tip of the short arm of chromosome 4 and within its coding sequence, near the 5' end, it contained a certain number of trinicleotide (CAG)n (cytosine-adenine-guanine) repeats (Figure 1). This gene codes for a protein (348 kd) called ""huntington"" that is widely expressed, and its sequence is not related to any protein [6]. The normal range of (CAG)n repeat numbers within IT15 was reported to be between 6 and 37 [6]. Mutation responsible for Huntington's disease implied expansion of (CAG)n repeats: in patients with Huntington's disease the pathologic range was determined to be between 35 and 121 repeats [7-10]. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study we correlated the age at onset, rate of progression and initial symptoms of Huntington's disease with the number of trinucleotide (CAG)n repeats in IT15. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes of patients fulfilling clinical criteria for definite and probable Huntington's disease [2]. Genetic verification of Huntington's disease was made by the previously described and modified PRC (polymerase chain reaction) technique [17, 18]. In our laboratory a gene with 40 or more repeats was considered as a marker of Huntington's disease. RESULTS: The study comprised 26 patients (11 women and 15 men). At the onset of Huntington's disease they were between 19 and 66 years old (36.6 12.8 years), with the duration of the disease between 1 and 15 years (5.8 4.3 years). The number of (CAG)n, repeats in IT15 ranged between 40 and 95 (49.9 14.1). The negative correlation between the (CAG)n, count in the expanded allele and the age at onset of the disease has been confirmed. Regression analysis showed the correlation coefficient of -0.54 (p = 0.012). The effect of trinucleotide (CAG)n, repeats on the initial clinical manifestations and rate of progression of Huntington's disease is only one of the growing group of ""CAG-repeat"" disorders that also include entities such as spinocerebellar ataxia-type 1 and 3, spinobulbar muscular atrophy and dentato-rubo-pallidoluysian atrophy [6]."
9877527	Huntington disease: clinical, genetic, and social aspects.	Huntington disease (HD) is a fascinating neurodegenerative disorder whose features straddle the boundaries of psychiatry, neurology, and genetics. The clinical symptoms of HD consist of a triad of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric/behavioral disturbances. In 1993, the HD Collaborative Research Group identified the gene and the mutation responsible for HD. HD was one of the first neurodegenerative disorders discovered to be caused by a novel mutational mechanism known as trinucleotide repeat expansion. Since then, HD has been the model for autosomal dominant neurogenetic disorders. The clinical, pathological, and genetic aspects of the disease are reviewed and some of the questions that remain to be answered by researchers of the 21st century are outlined.
9887328	In vitro evidence for both the nucleus and cytoplasm as subcellular sites of pathogenesis in Huntington's disease.	A unifying feature of the CAG expansion diseases is the formation of intracellular aggregates composed of the mutant polyglutamine-expanded protein. Despite the presence of aggregates in affected patients, the precise relationship between aggregates and disease pathogenesis is unresolved. Results from in vivo and in vitro studies of mutant huntingtin have lead to the hypothesis that nuclear localization of aggregates is critical for the pathology of Huntington's disease (HD). We tested this hypothesis using a 293T cell culture model system that compared the frequency and toxicity of cytoplasmic and nuclear huntingtin aggregates. We first assessed the mode of nuclear transport of N-terminal fragments of huntingtin, and show that the predicted endogenous NLS is not functional, providing data in support of passive nuclear transport. This result suggests that proteolysis is a necessary step for nuclear entry of huntingtin. Additionally, insertion of nuclear import or export sequences into huntingtin fragments containing 548 or 151 amino acids was used to reverse the normal localization of these proteins. Changing the subcellular localization of the fragments did not influence their total aggregate frequency. There were also no significant differences in toxicity associated with the presence of nuclear compared with cytoplasmic aggregates. The findings of nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates in affected brains, together with these in vitro data, support the nucleus and cytosol as subcellular sites for pathogenesis in HD.
9920660	Mutant huntingtin expression in clonal striatal cells: dissociation of inclusion formation and neuronal survival by caspase inhibition.	Neuronal intranuclear inclusions are found in the brains of patients with Huntington's disease and form from the polyglutamine-expanded N-terminal region of mutant huntingtin. To explore the properties of inclusions and their involvement in cell death, mouse clonal striatal cells were transiently transfected with truncated and full-length human wild-type and mutant huntingtin cDNAs. Both normal and mutant proteins localized in the cytoplasm, and infrequently, in dispersed and perinuclear vacuoles. Only mutant huntingtin formed nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions, which increased with polyglutamine expansion and with time after transfection. Nuclear inclusions contained primarily cleaved N-terminal products, whereas cytoplasmic inclusions contained cleaved and larger intact proteins. Cells with wild-type or mutant protein had distinct apoptotic features (membrane blebbing, shrinkage, cellular fragmentation), but those with mutant huntingtin generated the most cell fragments (apoptotic bodies). The caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK significantly increased cell survival but did not diminish nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions. In contrast, Z-DEVD-FMK significantly reduced nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions but did not increase survival. A series of N-terminal products was formed from truncated normal and mutant proteins and from full-length mutant huntingtin but not from full-length wild-type huntingtin. One prominent N-terminal product was blocked by Z-VAD-FMK. In summary, the formation of inclusions in clonal striatal cells corresponds to that seen in the HD brain and is separable from events that regulate cell death. N-terminal cleavage may be linked to mutant huntingtin's role in cell death.
10029099	Axonal transport of N-terminal huntingtin suggests early pathology of corticostriatal projections in Huntington disease.	Aggregation of N-terminal mutant huntingtin within nuclear inclusions and dystrophic neurites occurs in the cortex and striatum of Huntington disease (HD) patients and may be involved in neurodegeneration. We examined the prevalence of inclusions and dystrophic neurites in the cortex and striatum of 15 adult onset HD patients who had mild to severe striatal cell loss (grades 1, 2 or 3) using an antibody that detects the N-terminal region of huntingtin. Nuclear inclusions were more frequent in the cortex than the striatum and were sparse or absent in the striatum of patients with low-grade striatal pathology. Dystrophic neurites occurred in both regions. Patients with low-grade striatal pathology had numerous fibers with immunoreactive puncta and large swellings within the striatal neuropil, the subcortical white matter, and the internal and external capsules. In the globus pallidus of 3 grade 1 cases, N-terminal huntingtin markedly accumulated in the perinuclear cytoplasm and in some axons but not in the nucleus. Findings suggest that in the earlier stages of HD, accumulation of N-terminal mutant huntingtin occurs in the cytoplasm and is associated with degeneration of the corticostriatal pathway.
10537061	Tissue transglutaminase is increased in Huntington's disease brain.	The polyglutamine-expanded N-terminal region of mutant huntingtin causes neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease (HD). Neuronal intranuclear and cytosolic inclusions composed of mutant huntingtin are found in brains of HD patients. Because tissue transglutaminase cross-links proteins into filamentous aggregates and polypeptide-bound glutamines are primary determining factors for tissue transglutaminase-catalyzed reactions, it has been hypothesized that tissue transglutaminase may contribute to the formation of these aggregates. In this report immunohistochemical and biochemical methods were used to demonstrate that tissue transglutaminase expression and transglutaminase activity are elevated in HD brains in a grade-dependent manner. In the striatum, tissue transglutaminase activity was significantly increased in the grade 3 HD cases compared with controls. When normalized to the neuronal marker calbindin D28k, immunoblot analysis revealed that in the striatum the levels of tissue transglutaminase were significantly increased in all HD cases compared with controls. Immunohistochemical staining of the HD striatum revealed that tissue transglutaminase immunoreactivity was markedly increased in all grades as compared with controls. In the superior frontal cortex, tissue transglutaminase activity was significantly higher in all HD cases as compared with controls. Quantitative analysis of immunoblots demonstrated that tissue transglutaminase levels were elevated in HD grades 2 and 3 cases. Tissue transglutaminase immunoreactivity within the superior frontal neocortex was also greater in all the HD cases compared with controls. These data clearly indicate that tissue transglutaminase is elevated in HD brain and may play a role in the disease process.
10716661	Recent insights into the molecular pathogenesis of Huntington disease.	Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HD gene resulting in expression of an uninterrupted polyglutamine stretch within the N-terminus of its protein product huntingtin (htt). In this article we review the clinical, genetic, and neuropathological features of HD and discuss recent insights into the pathogenesis of HD. Examining the role of CAG repeat size on age of onset and penetrance in HD using a refined database of human HD patients has provided further support for the importance of the CAG repeat in the pathogenesis of HD and information leading to a predictive model for the likelihood of being affected by a specific age for a particular CAG expansion. In a YAC transgenic mouse model that replicates key elements of the HD phenotype, the development of selective striatal neurodegeneration is coincident with cleavage of htt and translocation of the N-terminal htt fragment into the nucleus. We also review in vitro evidence that htt is a substrate for cleavage by a group of cysteine proteases involved in apoptotic death-the caspases, and that caspase cleavage of htt results in the generation of a toxic N-terminal fragment. Inhibiting caspase cleavage of huntingtin eliminates the toxicity of the mutant htt protein. These results suggest that cleavage of huntingtin resulting in production of a truncated N-terminal fragment may be a crucial step in the pathogenesis of Huntington disease and that inhibition of this process may be a potential therapeutic strategy for this currently untreatable disorder.
10829068	Inhibition of huntingtin fibrillogenesis by specific antibodies and small molecules: implications for Huntington's disease therapy.	The accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates in intra and perinuclear inclusions is a hallmark of Huntington's disease (HD) and related glutamine-repeat disorders. A central question is whether protein aggregation plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative diseases. Here we show by using a filter retardation assay that the mAb 1C2, which specifically recognizes the elongated polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch in huntingtin, and the chemical compounds Congo red, thioflavine S, chrysamine G, and Direct fast yellow inhibit HD exon 1 protein aggregation in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, potential inhibitors of amyloid-beta formation such as thioflavine T, gossypol, melatonin, and rifampicin had little or no inhibitory effect on huntingtin aggregation in vitro. The results obtained by the filtration assay were confirmed by electron microscopy, SDS/PAGE, and MS. Furthermore, cell culture studies revealed that the Congo red dye at micromolar concentrations reduced the extent of HD exon 1 aggregation in transiently transfected COS cells. Together, these findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism of huntingtin fibrillogenesis in vitro and provide the basis for the development of new huntingtin aggregation inhibitors that may be effective in treating HD.
10829080	Severe deficiencies in dopamine signaling in presymptomatic Huntington's disease mice.	In Huntington's disease (HD), mutation of huntingtin causes selective neurodegeneration of dopaminoceptive striatal medium spiny neurons. Transgenic HD model mice that express a portion of the disease-causing form of human huntingtin develop a behavioral phenotype that suggests dysfunction of dopaminergic neurotransmission. Here we show that presymtomatic mice have severe deficiencies in dopamine signaling in the striatum. These include selective reductions in total levels of dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein, M(r) 32 kDA (DARPP-32) and other dopamine-regulated phosphoprotein markers of medium spiny neurons. HD mice also show defects in dopamine-regulated ion channels and in the D(1) dopamine/DARPP-32 signaling cascade. These presymptomatic defects may contribute to HD pathology.
11553930	Juvenile onset Huntington's disease--clinical and research perspectives.	Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder. The mutation which causes the disease is an expansion in the number of repetitions of three nucleotides, C, A, and G in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene. The gene normally has 15 to 30 repeats and an expansion to 40 or more is associated with HD. HD usually has a mid-life onset, but a juvenile form, defined by onset of symptoms before the age of 21 years, is present in about 7% of HD cases. Juvenile HD is characterized by (1) transmission from an HD affected father, (2) an unusually large repeat size, usually of 60 or more units, and (3) unique clinical features, including rigidity and seizure disorder. Although juvenile onset is associated with a more severe neuropathological involvement, the neuropathological characteristics of juvenile HD are similar to those seen in the adult form in that the striatum bears the brunt of the illness. Clumps of protein, termed inclusion bodies, which stain positive for huntingtin and ubiquitin, are found primarily in the nucleus but also in the cytoplasm and axons in HD neurons. Research suggests that these inclusion bodies sequester a deleterious protein fragment and prolong cell life during the degenerative process of the disease.
11943195	Mutant huntingtin aggregates do not sensitize cells to apoptotic stressors.	It has been postulated that neuronal inclusions composed of mutant huntingtin may play a causative role in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease. To study the putative role of aggregates in modulating apoptotic vulnerability, SH-SY5Y cell lines stably expressing truncated huntingtin with 18 (wild-type) (N63-18Q) or 82 (mutant) (N63-82Q) glutamine repeats were established. Aggregates were observed in approximately 13% of the N63-82Q cells; no aggregates were observed in the N63-18Q cells. In response to apoptotic stimuli such as staurosporine or hyperosmotic stress, caspase-3 activity was significantly greater in the N63-82Q cells compared to the N63-18Q cells. However, double immunostaining for huntingtin and active caspase-3 revealed that the presence of aggregates did not correlate with the presence of active caspase-3, indicating that aggregates do not contribute to the increase in apoptosis in the N63-82Q cells.
12165556	Increased huntingtin protein length reduces the number of polyglutamine-induced gene expression changes in mouse models of Huntington's disease.	Both transcriptional dysregulation and proteolysis of mutant huntingtin (htt) are postulated to be important components of Huntington's disease (HD) pathogenesis. In previous studies, we demonstrated that transgenic mice that express short mutant htt fragments containing 171 or fewer N-terminal residues (R6/2 and N171-82Q mice) recapitulate many of the mRNA changes observed in human HD brain. To examine whether htt protein length influences the ability of its expanded polyglutamine domain to alter gene expression, we conducted mRNA profiling analyses of mice that express an extended N-terminal fragment (HD46, HD100; 964 amino acids) or full-length (YAC72; 3144 amino acids) mutant htt transprotein. Oligonucleotide microarray analyses of HD46 and YAC72 mice identified fewer differentially expressed mRNAs than were seen in transgenic mice expressing short N-terminal mutant htt fragments. Histologic analyses also detected limited changes in these mice (small decreases in adenosine A2a receptor mRNA and dopamine D2 receptor binding in HD100 animals; small increases in dopamine D1 receptor binding in HD46 and HD100 mice). Neither HD46 nor YAC72 mice exhibited altered mRNA levels similar to those observed previously in R6/2 mice, N171-82Q mice or human HD patients. These findings suggest that htt protein length influences the ability of an expanded polyglutamine domain to alter gene expression. Furthermore, our findings suggest that short N-terminal fragments of mutant htt might be responsible for the gene expression alterations observed in human HD brain.
12217951	Identification of a presymptomatic molecular phenotype in Hdh CAG knock-in mice.	The hallmark striatal neurodegeneration of Huntington's disease (HD) is first triggered by a dominant property of the expanded glutamine tract in mutant huntingtin that increases in severity with glutamine size. Indeed 111-glutamine murine huntingtin leads to a dominant cascade of phenotypes in Hdh(Q111) mice, although these abnormalities are not manifest in Hdh(Q50) mice, with 50-glutamine mutant protein. Therefore, to identify phenotypes that might reflect events closer to the fundamental trigger mechanism, and that can be measured as a consequence of adult-onset HD mutant huntingtin, we have screened for altered expression of genes conserved in evolution, which are likely to encode essential proteins. Probes generated from Hdh(Q111) homozygote and wild-type striatal RNAs were hybridized to human gene segments on filter arrays, disclosing a mutant-specific increase in hybridization to Rrs1, encoding a ribosomal protein. Subsequent, quantitative RT-PCR assays demonstrated increased Rrs1 mRNA from 3 weeks of age in homozygous and heterozygous Hdh(Q111) striatum and increased Rrs1 mRNA expression with a single copy's worth of 50-glutamine mutant huntingtin in Hdh(Q50) striatum. Moreover, quantitative RT-PCR assays for the human homologue demonstrated elevated Rrs1 mRNA in HD compared with control postmortem brain. These findings, therefore, support a chronic impact of mutant huntingtin on an essential ribosomal regulatory gene to be investigated for its role very early in HD pathogenesis.
9657855	Gene structure and map location of the murine homolog of the Huntington-associated protein, Hap1.	Huntington's Disease (HD) is an inherited progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with a mutation in a gene expressed in both affected and non-affected tissues. The selective neuropathology in HD is thought to be mediated in part through interactions with other proteins including the Huntington Associated Protein, HAP-1, which is predominantly expressed in the brain. We have mapped its murine homolog, Hap1, to mouse Chr 11 (band D), which shares extensive synteny with human Chr 17 including the region 17q21-q22, where the gene for 'frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17' has bee mapped. In addition, we have sequenced a 21,984 base pair (bp) genomic clone encompassing the entire Hap1 gene. It is organized as 11 exons and flanked by exons from potentially one or more novel genes. At least three Hap1 transcripts (Hap1-A; Hap1-B; Hap1-C) can be formed by alternative splicing at the 3' end of the gene leading to protein isoforms with novel C-termini.
10192780	Huntington's disease intranuclear inclusions contain truncated, ubiquitinated huntingtin protein.	Intranuclear inclusion bodies are a shared pathological feature of Huntington's disease (HD) and its transgenic mouse model. Using a panel of antibodies spanning the entire huntingtin molecule, we have investigated the pattern of immunoreactivity within the intranuclear inclusions in the frontal cortex and striatum of patients with HD. The intranuclear inclusions reacted with anti-ubiquitin and antibodies against the N-terminal portion of huntingtin (CAG53b, HP1), but not with HD1 and the 1C2 antibodies that detect the expanded polyglutamine tract nor the more C-terminal antibodies. However, the 1C2, HP1, CAG53b, and HD1 antibodies detected granular cytoplasmic deposits in cortical and striatal neurons that also contained intranuclear N-terminal huntingtin immunoreactivity. These data show a differential intracellular location of truncated huntingtin in the HD brain. Both the cytoplasmic and the nuclear aggregates of the protein fragments could be neurotoxic. The frequency of the cortical intranuclear inclusions correlated with the size of CAG expansion and was inversely related to the age at onset and death. No such correlations were detected for the striatum, which most likely reflects a more advanced neuronal loss accrued by the time of death.
10434302	Evidence for a recruitment and sequestration mechanism in Huntington's disease.	Polyglutamine (polyQ) extension in the coding sequence of mutant huntingtin causes neuronal degeneration associated with the formation of insoluble polyQ aggregates in Huntington's disease. We constructed an array of CAG/CAA triplet repeats, coding for a range of 25-300 glutamine residues, which was used to generate expression constructs with minimal flanking sequence. Normal-length (25 glutamine residues) polyQ did not aggregate when transfected alone. Remarkably, when co-transfected with extended (100-300 glutamine residues) polyQ tracts, normal-length polyQ-containing peptides were trapped in insoluble detergent-resistant aggregates. Aggregates formed in the cytoplasm but were visible in the nucleus only when a strong nuclear localization signal was present. Intermolecular interactions between polyQ tracts mediated the localization of heterogeneous aggregates into the nucleolus by nucleolin protein. Our results suggest that extended polyQ can interact with cellular polyQ-containing proteins, transport them to ectopic cellular locations, and form heterogeneous polyQ aggregates. We provide evidence for a recruitment mechanism for pathogenesis in the polyQ neurodegenerative disorders. In susceptible cells, extended polyQ tracts in huntingtin might interact with and sequester or deplete certain endogenous polyQ-containing cellular proteins.
10488448	Pathological mechanisms in Huntington's disease and other polyglutamine expansion diseases.	HD is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by involuntary movements, cognitive impairment progressing to dementia, and mood disturbances. The brains of patients show extensive neuronal loss in the striatum, and the cerebral cortex is also affected. The genetic defect causing HD is an expansion of a CAG repeat encoding a polyglutamine stretch in the target protein, named huntingtin. The age of onset of HD is inversely correlated with the size of the expansion. Polyglutamine expansion represents a novel cause of neurodegeneration, which has been shown to be responsible for seven other inherited disorders. The polyglutamine expansion confers a gain of toxic property to the mutated target proteins. Molecular and cellular studies of the brains of patients and of mice models of polyglutamine expansion diseases have led to the identification of abnormal intracellular inclusions representing aggregation of the mutated protein. However, the mechanism whereby such polyglutamine expansion leads to selective neuronal dysfunction and death is still puzzling.
10779703	Mice transgenic for the human Huntington's disease mutation have reduced sensitivity to kainic acid toxicity.	"The mechanism underlying the pathology of Huntington's disease (HD) is unknown, although there is substantial evidence supporting a role for excitotoxicity. The discovery of abnormal aggregations of protein in the brains of patients with HD, as well as in the brains of transgenic mice modeling this disease, has led to the suggestion that these ""inclusions"" have a pathogenic role. However, the relationship between inclusion formation and the progressive neurodegeneration in HD remains unclear. Here, we used mice transgenic for the first exon of the HD gene and an expanded CAG repeat (R6/2 line) to examine the role of neuronal intranuclear inclusions in kainic acid (KA) excitotoxicity. Unexpectedly, we found that the toxicity of KA was markedly attenuated in R6/2 mice compared with wild-type mice. In particular, the number and severity of KA-induced seizures in R6/2 mice was significantly reduced. When seizures occurred in 3-week-old R6/2 mice, we found lesions in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. However, neuronal intranuclear inclusions were not induced by KA in 3-week-old mice. Further, in older mice (9 weeks), the pre-existence of inclusions in CA3 neurons did not increase the vulnerability of neurons to KA, since no lesions were seen in 9-week R6/2 mouse brain. Our results suggest that an increased susceptibility to excitotoxic stimuli does not underlie the early phase of the neurological phenotype in R6/2 mice, although a role in later stages is not excluded by our findings. The significance of these findings is discussed in the context of the R6/2 mouse as a model for HD."
10966117	The early cellular pathology of Huntington's disease.	Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that affects about one in 10,000 individuals in North America. The genetic defect responsible for the disease is an expansion of a CAG repeat that encodes a polyglutamine tract in the expressed protein, huntingtin. The disease is characterized by involuntary movements, cognitive impairment, and emotional disturbance. Despite the widespread expression of huntingtin, the brains of HD patients show selective neuronal loss in the striatum and the deep layers of the cerebral cortex. Recent studies have shown that polyglutamine expansion causes huntingtin to aggregate, to accumulate in the nucleus, and to interact abnormally with other proteins. Several cellular and animal models for HD have revealed that intranuclear accumulation of mutant huntingtin and the formation of neuropil aggregates precede neurological symptoms and neurodegeneration. Intranuclear huntingtin may affect nuclear function and the expression of genes important for neuronal function, whereas neuropil aggregates may interfere with neuritic transport and function. These early pathological events, which occur in the absence of neurodegeneration, may contribute to the neurological symptoms of HD and ultimately lead to neuronal cell death.
11260214	"The ""flap"" endonuclease gene FEN1 is excluded as a candidate gene implicated in the CAG repeat expansion underlying Huntington disease."	At least 12 disorders including Huntington disease (HD) are associated with expansion of a trinucleotide repeat (TNR). Factors contributing to the risk of expansion of TNRs and the mechanism of expansion have not been elucidated. Data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggest that the flap endonuclease FEN1 plays a role in expansion of repetitive DNA tracts. It has been hypothesized that insufficiency of FEN1 or a mutant FEN1 might contribute to the occurrence of expansion events of long repetitive DNA tracts after polymerase slippage events during lagging strand synthesis. The expression pattern of FEN1 was determined, and ubiquitous tissue expression, including germ cells, suggested that FEN1 has the potential to be involved in HD. Fifteen HD parent/child pairs that demonstrated intergenerational increases in CAG length of greater than 10 repeats were examined for possible mutations or polymorphisms within the FEN1 gene that could underlie the saltatory repeat expansions seen in these individuals. No alterations were observed compared to 50 controls, excluding FEN1 as a trans-acting factor underlying TNR expansion. The identification of a candidate gene(s) in HD or other CAG-expansion disorders implicated in TNR instability will elucidate the mechanism of expansion for this growing family of neurological disorders.
11406606	Expanded CAG repeats in exon 1 of the Huntington's disease gene stimulate dopamine-mediated striatal neuron autophagy and degeneration.	Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in exon 1 of the gene coding for the huntingtin protein. The cellular pathway by which this mutation induces HD remains unknown, although alterations in protein degradation are involved. To study intrinsic cellular mechanisms linked to the mutation, we examined dissociated postnatally derived cultures of striatal neurons from transgenic mice expressing exon 1 of the human HD gene carrying a CAG repeat expansion. While there was no difference in cell death between wild-type and mutant littermate-derived cultures, the mutant striatal neurons exhibited elevated cell death following a single exposure to a neurotoxic concentration of dopamine. The mutant neurons exposed to dopamine also exhibited lysosome-associated responses including induction of autophagic granules and electron-dense lysosomes. The autophagic/lysosomal compartments co-localized with high levels of oxygen radicals in living neurons, and ubiquitin. The results suggest that the combination of mutant huntingtin and a source of oxyradical stress (provided in this case by dopamine) induces autophagy and may underlie the selective cell death characteristic of HD.
11675509	Caspase 3-cleaved N-terminal fragments of wild-type and mutant huntingtin are present in normal and Huntington's disease brains, associate with membranes, and undergo calpain-dependent proteolysis.	The Huntington's disease (HD) mutation is a polyglutamine expansion in the N-terminal region of huntingtin (N-htt). How neurons die in HD is unclear. Mutant N-htt aggregates in neurons in the HD brain; expression of mutant N-htt in vitro causes cell death. Other in vitro studies show that proteolysis by caspase 3 could be important in regulating mutant N-htt function, but there has been no direct evidence for caspase 3-cleaved N-htt fragments in brain. Here, we show that N-htt fragments consistent with the size produced by caspase 3 cleavage in vitro are resident in the cortex, striatum, and cerebellum of normal and adult onset HD brain and are similar in size to the fragments seen after exogenous expression of human huntingtin in mouse clonal striatal neurons. HD brain extracts treated with active caspase 3 had increased levels of N-htt fragments. Compared with the full-length huntingtin, the caspase 3-cleaved N-htt fragments, especially the mutant fragment, preferentially segregated with the membrane fraction. Partial proteolysis of the human caspase 3-cleaved N-htt fragment by calpain occurred in vitro and resulted in smaller N-terminal products; products of similar size appeared when mouse brain protein extracts were treated with calpain. Results support the idea that sequential proteolysis by caspase 3 and calpain may regulate huntingtin function at membranes and produce N-terminal mutant fragments that aggregate and cause cellular dysfunction in HD.
12589027	Dietary restriction normalizes glucose metabolism and BDNF levels, slows disease progression, and increases survival in huntingtin mutant mice.	In addition to neurological deficits, Huntington's disease (HD) patients and transgenic mice expressing mutant human huntingtin exhibit reduced levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, hyperglycemia, and tissue wasting. We show that the progression of neuropathological (formation of huntingtin inclusions and apoptotic protease activation), behavioral (motor dysfunction), and metabolic (glucose intolerance and tissue wasting) abnormalities in huntingtin mutant mice, an animal model of HD, are retarded when the mice are maintained on a dietary restriction (DR) feeding regimen resulting in an extension of their life span. DR increases levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the protein chaperone heat-shock protein-70 in the striatum and cortex, which are depleted in HD mice fed a normal diet. The suppression of the pathogenic processes by DR in HD mice suggests that mutant huntingtin promotes neuronal degeneration by impairing cellular stress resistance, and that the body wasting in HD is driven by the neurodegenerative process. Our findings suggest a dietary intervention that may suppress the disease process and increase the life span of humans that carry the mutant huntingtin gene.
14521962	Targeted nucleotide exchange in the CAG repeat region of the human HD gene.	Huntington's disease (HD) is marked by the expansion of a tract of repeated CAG codons in the HD-gene, IT15. Once expressed, the expanded poly Q region of the huntingtin protein (Htt), which is normally soluble, becomes insoluble, leading to the formation of intracellular inclusions and ultimately to neuronal degeneration. Interruption of the pure poly Q tract at the genetic level should undermine the transition from Htt solubility to Htt insolubility. Modified single-stranded oligonucleotides were used to direct the nucleotide exchange of an A residue to a T residue in the second codon of the HD-gene, resulting in the creation of a leucine residue among the poly Q tract. Consistent with results from other groups, we provide evidence that short synthetic DNA molecules can modify the HD-gene directly, preliminarily offering a potential therapeutic approach to Huntington's disease.
9949199	Intranuclear inclusions and neuritic aggregates in transgenic mice expressing a mutant N-terminal fragment of huntingtin.	Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited, neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a glutamine repeat in the N-terminus of the huntingtin protein. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of HD, we generated transgenic mice that express a cDNA encoding an N-terminal fragment (171 amino acids) of huntingtin with 82, 44 or 18 glutamines. Mice expressing relatively low steady-state levels of N171 huntingtin with 82 glutamine repeats (N171-82Q) develop behavioral abnormalities, including loss of coordination, tremors, hypokinesis and abnormal gait, before dying prematurely. In mice exhibiting these abnormalities, diffuse nuclear labeling, intranuclear inclusions and neuritic aggregates, all immunoreactive with an antibody to the N-terminus (amino acids 1-17) of huntingtin (AP194), were found in multiple populations of neurons. None of these behavioral or pathological phenotypes were seen in mice expressing N171-18Q. These findings are consistent with the idea that N-terminal fragments of huntingtin with a repeat expansion are toxic to neurons, and that N-terminal fragments are prone to form both intranuclear inclusions and neuritic aggregates.
10363492	[Genetic bases in Huntington disease].	"Huntington disease is a neurodegenerative syndrome of late appearance in 80% of the cases. Its clinical course shows motor and cognitive disorders which lead to total incapacity of the individual 10 to 15 years after the appearance of the first syndromes. From a genetic point of view, this disease is of autosomic dominant inheritance with complete penetration. The gene (IT15) is localized in the short arm of chromosome 4 in the telemaric region 4p16.3 and it is known that the mutation is produced by an increase in the number of trinucleotides CAG (glutamine) localized in the 5' end of the gene, in the first exon. In the general population these are repeated in a number of less than 30 repetitions and in the disease population in a number greater than 36 and, in some cases, even greater than 100 repetitions. These sequences are unstable from one generation to another and this fact may explain the phenomenon of genetic anticipation shown in this disease since there is an inversely proportional correlation between the number of repetitions and the age of appearance of the first symptoms. The gene codifies for a protein known as ""huntingtina"" which is expressed not only in brain but also in different tissues. Although the function remains unknown, it is known that it is bound to other proteins related to the transmission of neuron signals and to the regulation of neuron death (apoptosis) among others. The defect is produced by a gain in function closely related to the number of repetitions. At present, presymptomatic and prenatal diagnosis of the disease may be achieved since the reliability of the studies is practically 100%. Nonetheless, the demand is lower than expected and this may be due to psychologic, social and legal problems, together with the lack of adequate infrastructure for completely guaranteeing the performance of these studies."
10589536	Huntington aggregates may not predict neuronal death in Huntington's disease.	The mechanism by which polyglutamine expansion in Huntington's disease (HD) results in selective neuronal degeneration remains unclear. We previously reported that the immunohistochemical distribution of N-terminal huntingtin in HD does not correspond to the severity of neuropathology, such that significantly greater numbers of huntingtin aggregates are present within the cortex than in the striatum. We now show a dissociation between huntingtin aggregation and the selective pattern of striatal neuron loss observed in HD. Aggregate formation was predominantly observed in spared interneurons, with few or no aggregates found within vulnerable spiny striatal neurons. Multiple perikaryal aggregates were present in almost all cortical NADPH-diaphorase neurons and in approximately 50% of the spared NADPH-diaphorase striatal neurons from early grade HD cases. In severe grade HD patients, aggregates were more prominent as nuclear inclusions in NADPH-diaphorase neurons, with less perikaryal and neuropil aggregation. In contrast, nuclear or perikaryal huntingtin aggregates were present in less than 4% of the vulnerable calbindin striatal neurons in all HD cases. These findings support the hypothesis that polyglutamine aggregation may not be a predictor of cell loss. Rather than a harbinger of neuronal death, mutant huntingtin aggregation may be a cytoprotective mechanism against polyglutamine-induced neurotoxicity.
11149616	Polymorphisms in the CAG repeat--a source of error in Huntington disease DNA testing.	Five of 400 patients (1.3%), referred for Huntington disease DNA testing, demonstrated a single allele on CAG alone, but two alleles when the CAG + CCG repeats were measured. The PCR assay failed to detect one allele in the CAG alone assay because of single-base silent polymorphisms in the penultimate or the last CAG repeat. The region around and within the CAG repeat sequence in the Huntington disease gene is a hot-spot for DNA polymorphisms, which can occur in up to 1% of subjects tested for Huntington disease. These polymorphisms may interfere with amplification by PCR, and so have the potential to produce a diagnostic error.
11172033	The Gln-Ala repeat transcriptional activator CA150 interacts with huntingtin: neuropathologic and genetic evidence for a role in Huntington's disease pathogenesis.	Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by polyglutamine expansion in the protein huntingtin (htt). Pathogenesis in HD appears to involve the formation of ubiquitinated neuronal intranuclear inclusions containing N-terminal mutated htt, abnormal protein interactions, and the aggregate sequestration of a variety of proteins (noticeably, transcription factors). To identify novel htt-interacting proteins in a simple model system, we used a yeast two-hybrid screen with a Caenorhabditis elegans activation domain library. We found a predicted WW domain protein (ZK1127.9) that interacts with N-terminal fragments of htt in two-hybrid tests. A human homologue of ZK1127.9 is CA150, a transcriptional coactivator with a N-terminal insertion that contains an imperfect (Gln-Ala)(38) tract encoded by a polymorphic repeat DNA. CA150 interacted in vitro with full-length htt from lymphoblastoid cells. The expression of CA150, measured immunohistochemically, was markedly increased in human HD brain tissue compared with normal age-matched human brain tissue, and CA150 showed aggregate formation with partial colocalization to ubiquitin-positive aggregates. In 432 HD patients, the CA150 repeat length explains a small, but statistically significant, amount of the variability in the onset age. Our data suggest that abnormal expression of CA150, mediated by interaction with polyglutamine-expanded htt, may alter transcription and have a role in HD pathogenesis.
11182459	Loss of normal huntingtin function: new developments in Huntington's disease research.	Huntington's disease is characterized by a loss of brain striatal neurons that occurs as a consequence of an expansion of a CAG repeat in the huntingtin protein. The resulting extended polyglutamine stretch confers a deleterious gain-of-function to the protein. Analysis of the mutant protein has attracted most of the research activity in the field, however re-examination of earlier data and new results on the beneficial functions of normal huntingtin indicate that loss of the normal protein function might actually equally contribute to the pathology. Thus, complete elucidation of the physiological role(s) of huntingtin and its mode of action are essential and could lead to new therapeutic approaches.
11642542	Modeling Huntington's disease in cells, flies, and mice.	"A milestone in Huntington's disease (HD) research is represented by the identification of the causative gene. With the genetics at hand, a series of transgenic cellular and animal models has been developed, which has greatly contributed to understanding of HD. All these models are described in this review, and are compared to each other, along with the information they have generated. Although the mechanism by which progressive loss of striatal neurons occurs in HD remains uncertain, hypotheses on mutant huntingtin toxicity involve impaired vescicular trafficking, transcriptional dysregulation, and/or activation of apoptotic pathways. The development of inducible HD mice has shown that neurodegeneration in HD may be at least partially blocked. Although traditionally considered a ""gain-of-function"" disease, the recent finding that normal huntingtin has an important role in neuronal survival suggests that loss of function of the normal protein might contribute to HD as well, also discloseing new perspectives on the therapeutical approach to the pathology."
11739372	Huntingtin is present in the nucleus, interacts with the transcriptional corepressor C-terminal binding protein, and represses transcription.	Huntingtin is a protein of unknown function that contains a polyglutamine tract, which is expanded in patients with Huntington's disease (HD). We investigated the localization and a potential function for huntingtin in the nucleus. In human fibroblasts from normal and HD patients, huntingtin localized diffusely in the nucleus and in subnuclear compartments identified as speckles, promyelocytic leukemia protein bodies, and nucleoli. Huntingtin-positive nuclear bodies redistributed after treatment with sodium butyrate. By Western blot, purified nuclei had low levels of full-length huntingtin compared with the cytoplasm but contained high levels of N- and C-terminal huntingtin fragments, which tightly bound the nuclear matrix. Full-length huntingtin co-immunoprecipitated with the transcriptional corepressor C-terminal binding protein, and polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin reduced this interaction. Full-length wild-type and mutant huntingtin repressed transcription when targeted to DNA. Truncated N-terminal mutant huntingtin repressed transcription, whereas the corresponding wild-type fragment did not repress transcription. We speculate that wild-type huntingtin may function in the nucleus in the assembly of nuclear matrix-bound protein complexes involved with transcriptional repression and RNA processing. Proteolysis of mutant huntingtin may alter nuclear functions by disrupting protein complexes and inappropriately repressing transcription in HD.
11789098	[Huntington disease--yet another mad protein?].	Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat. It is characterized by motor and cognitive disturbances, as well as cellular dysfunction and loss in the basal ganglia and the cerebral cortex. The mutant protein huntingtin aggregates in cells. The toxicity of mutant huntingtin, or the loss of its normal function, causes disruption of cellular functions such as protein and calcium metabolism, transmitter release, mitochondria and gene transcription. Recent findings in basic research open up new possibilities for novel therapies.
11839795	Interaction of Huntington disease protein with transcriptional activator Sp1.	Polyglutamine expansion causes Huntington disease (HD) and at least seven other neurodegenerative diseases. In HD, N-terminal fragments of huntingtin with an expanded glutamine tract are able to aggregate and accumulate in the nucleus. Although intranuclear huntingtin affects the expression of numerous genes, the mechanism of this nuclear effect is unknown. Here we report that huntingtin interacts with Sp1, a transcription factor that binds to GC-rich elements in certain promoters and activates transcription of the corresponding genes. In vitro binding and immunoprecipitation assays show that polyglutamine expansion enhances the interaction of N-terminal huntingtin with Sp1. In HD transgenic mice (R6/2) that express N-terminal-mutant huntingtin, Sp1 binds to the soluble form of mutant huntingtin but not to aggregated huntingtin. Mutant huntingtin inhibits the binding of nuclear Sp1 to the promoter of nerve growth factor receptor and suppresses its transcriptional activity in cultured cells. Overexpression of Sp1 reduces the cellular toxicity and neuritic extension defects caused by intranuclear mutant huntingtin. These findings suggest that the soluble form of mutant huntingtin in the nucleus may cause cellular dysfunction by binding to Sp1 and thus reducing the expression of Sp1-regulated genes.
11932021	Lessons from animal models of Huntington's disease.	Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HD gene. The expanded repeats are translated into an abnormally long polyglutamine tract close to the N-terminus of the HD gene product, huntingtin. Studies in mouse models and human suggest that the mutation is associated with a deleterious gain of function. There is now a wide range of mouse models for HD, providing important insights into processes associated with disease pathogenesis. These models have been complemented by studies in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans that have allowed the identification of possible modifier loci through suppressor screens.
12969272	Histone deacetylase activity is retained in primary neurons expressing mutant huntingtin protein.	Perturbation of histone acetyl-transferase (HAT) activity is implicated in the pathology of polyglutamine diseases, and suppression of the counteracting histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins has been proposed as a therapeutic candidate for these intractable disorders. Meanwhile, it is not known whether mutant polyglutamine disease protein affects the HDAC activity in declining neurons, though the answer is essential for application of anti-HDAC drugs for polyglutamine diseases. Here, we show the effect of mutant huntingtin (htt) protein on the expression and activity of HDAC proteins in rat primary cortical neurons as well as in human Huntington's disease (HD) brains. Our findings indicate that expression and activity of HDAC proteins are not repressed by mutant htt protein. Furthermore, expression of normal and mutant htt protein slightly increased HDAC activity although the effects of normal and mutant htt were not remarkably different. In human HD cerebral cortex, HDAC5 immunoreactivity was increased in the nucleus of striatal and cortical neurons, suggesting accelerated nuclear import of this class II HDAC. Meanwhile, western blot and immunohistochemical analyses showed no remarkable change in the expression of class I HDAC proteins such as HDAC1 and HDCA8. Collectively, retained activity in affected neurons supports application of anti-HDAC drugs to the therapy of HD.
9599014	HAP1-huntingtin interactions do not contribute to the molecular pathology in Huntington's disease transgenic mice.	HAP1 (huntingtin associated protein) has previously been found to interact with huntingtin (htt) in a glutamine length dependent manner and has been proposed to play a role in the cell specific neurodegeneration observed in Huntington's disease (HD). We have isolated mouse HAP1 (hap1) and have shown that expression is not enriched in areas specifically affected in HD. We have used the yeast two hybrid system to demonstrate that htt amino acids 171-230 are necessary for the hap1-htt binding and that hapl does not interact with the transgene exon 1 protein in a transgenic model of HD.
9806905	Isolation and characterization of the rat huntingtin promoter.	Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a (CAG)>37 repeat expansion in a novel gene of unknown function. Although the huntingtin gene is expressed in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues, the disease affects nerve cells of selected regional areas of the central nervous system. To gain insight into the regulation of the HD gene we analysed 1348 bp of the rat huntingtin promoter region. This region lacks a TATA and a CAAT box, is rich in GC content and has several consensus sequences for binding sites for SP1, PEA3, Sif and H2A. The stretch between nucleotides -56 and -206 relative to the first ATG is highly conserved between human and rodents and it harbours several potential binding sites for transcription factors. We analysed deletion mutants fused with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in transfected, HD-expressing neuronal (NS20Y, NG108-15) and non-neuronal Chinese hamster ovary cell lines. Hence these cells should contain the required trans-acting factors necessary for HD gene expression. Partial deletion of the evolutionarily conserved part of the promoter significantly decreases the activity in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells, indicating that the core promoter activity is located between nucleotides -332 and -15. DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays were used to define the nucleotide positions and binding affinity of DNA-protein interactions.
9952397	Cellular localization of huntingtin in striatal and cortical neurons in rats: lack of correlation with neuronal vulnerability in Huntington's disease.	Immunohistochemistry and single-cell RT-PCR were used to characterize the localization of huntingtin and/or its mRNA in the major types of striatal neurons and in corticostriatal projection neurons in rats. Single-label immunohistochemical studies revealed that striatum contains scattered large neurons rich in huntingtin and more numerous medium-sized neurons moderate in huntingtin. Double-label immunohistochemical studies showed that the large huntingtin-rich striatal neurons include nearly all cholinergic interneurons and some parvalbuminergic interneurons. Somatostatinergic striatal interneurons, which are medium in size, rarely contained huntingtin. Calbindin immunolabeling showed that the vast majority of the medium-sized striatal neurons that contain huntingtin are projection neurons, but only approximately 65% of calbindin-labeled projection neurons (localized to the matrix compartment of striatum) were labeled for huntingtin. Calbindin-containing projection neurons of the matrix compartment and calbindin-negative projection neurons of the striatal patch compartment contained huntingtin with comparable frequency. Single-cell RT-PCR confirmed that striatal cholinergic interneurons contain huntingtin, but only approximately 65% of projection neurons contained detectable huntingtin message. The finding that huntingtin is not consistently found in striatal projection neurons [which die in Huntington's disease (HD)] but is abundant in striatal cholinergic interneurons (which survive in Huntington's disease) suggests that the mutation in huntingtin that causes HD may not directly kill neurons. In contrast to the heterogeneous expression of huntingtin in the different striatal neuron types, we found all corticostriatal neurons to be rich in huntingtin protein and mRNA. One possibility raised by our findings is that the HD mutation may render corticostriatal neurons destructive rather than render striatal neurons vulnerable.
10196373	Impaired synaptic plasticity in mice carrying the Huntington's disease mutation.	Cognitive impairment is an early symptom of Huntington's disease (HD). Mice engineered to carry the HD mutation in the endogenous huntingtin gene showed a significant reduction in long-term potentiation (LTP), a measure of synaptic plasticity often thought to be involved in memory. However, LTP could be induced in mutant slices by an 'enhanced' tetanic stimulus, implying that the LTP-producing mechanism is intact in mutant mice, but that their synapses are less able to reach the threshold for LTP induction. Mutant mice showed less post-tetanic potentiation than wild-type animals, and also showed decreased paired pulse facilitation, suggesting that excitatory synapses in HD mutant mice are impaired in their ability to sustain transmission during repetitive stimulation. We show that mutants, while normal in their ability to transmit at low frequencies, released significantly less glutamate during higher frequency synaptic activation. Thus, a reduced ability of Huntington synapses to respond to repetitive synaptic demand of even moderate frequency could result not only in a functional impairment of LTP induction, but could also serve as a substrate for the cognitive symptoms that comprise the early-stage pathology of HD.
10698681	Alpha-synuclein overexpression promotes aggregation of mutant huntingtin.	Protein aggregates are a neuropathological feature of Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease. Mutant huntingtin exon 1 with 72 CAG repeats fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) forms hyperfluorescent inclusions in PC12 cells. Inclusion formation is enhanced in cells co-transfected with EGFP-huntingtin-(CAG)(72) and alpha-synuclein, a major component of Parkinson's disease aggregates. However, alpha-synuclein does not form aggregates by itself, nor does it appear in huntingtin inclusions in vitro.
10749290	An autopsy case with clinically and molecular genetically diagnosed Huntington's disease with only minimal non-specific neuropathological findings.	An autopsy case with clinically and molecular genetically diagnosed Huntington's disease (HD) accompanied with minimal non-specific neuropathological features was reported. When the patient was 45 years old, he had faulty memory, mood swing, personality change and agitation. Neurological and psychiatric examinations revealed choreoathetoid movements in limbs and trunk, generalized hyperreflexia and mental deterioration. However, cerebellar ataxia and muscle rigidity were not disclosed. Neuroimaging study did not show a definite atrophy of heads of caudate nuclei. Neuroacanthocytosis and Wilson's disease were ruled out by the peripheral blood examination and serum Cu and ceruloplasmin examination. At the age of 55 he died of pneumonia. Post-mortem examination revealed minimal non-specific neuropathological features for HD (Vonsattel's grade 0), that is, no visible fibrillary gliosis in the striatum, and few neuronal loss and only proliferation of astrocytes (astrocytosis) in the striatum. Molecular-genetic study the patient's brain tissues and his youngest son's blood was performed. These studies revealed 40 CAG repeats in the patient, 56 CAG repeats in his youngest son. These results suggest they may be HD. Vonsattel et al. [ 1998] insist that grade 0 comprises 1% of all HD brains, and grade 1 comprises 4% of all HD brains. But we could not find any reports in which the clinical and neuropathological features were described in detail on the cases with clinically and molecular genetically diagnosed HD without specific pathological findings. Therefore, we present in detail the clinical and neuropathological features of such case.
10814708	Decreased expression of striatal signaling genes in a mouse model of Huntington's disease.	To understand gene expression changes mediated by a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the human huntingtin protein, we used oligonucleotide DNA arrays to profile approximately 6000 striatal mRNAs in the R6/2 mouse, a transgenic Huntington's disease (HD) model. We found diminished levels of mRNAs encoding components of the neurotransmitter, calcium and retinoid signaling pathways at both early and late symptomatic time points (6 and 12 weeks of age). We observed similar changes in gene expression in another HD mouse model (N171-82Q). These results demonstrate that mutant huntingtin directly or indirectly reduces the expression of a distinct set of genes involved in signaling pathways known to be critical to striatal neuron function.
10961047	[Huntington disease. A review].	Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. It affects about 1 in 10,000 individuals. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in the third or fourth decade of life, though it may appear at any age. The molecular basis of the disease is the expansion of the trinucleotide CAG in the first exon of a gene on chromosome four (4p 16.3). This gene encodes the protein huntingtin of 3136 amino acids. The mutation of huntingtin produces an expanded stretch of glutamine (Gln) residues. This CAG/polyGln expansion has 6 to 39 units in normal individuals and 36 to 180 units in HD patients. The normal function of huntingtin and the pathogenic mechanisms caused by the expanded polyGln of mutant huntingtin remain incompletely characterized. Huntingtin appears to be associated with synaptic vesicles and/or microtubules and seems to have an important role in vesicular transport and/or the binding to the cytoskeleton. It is thought that this protein is important in embryogenesis and that its mutant form alters the function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The toxic gain of function caused by huntingtin could either be an overactivity of the normal function or the introduction of a novel function. Its interactions with other proteins could lead to an impairment of the cellular function or to its own polymerization to form insoluble aggregates. The intraneuronal aggregates could affect gene transcription, protein interactions, protein transport inside the nucleus and cytoplasm, and the vesicular transport. However, since a dissociation between the aggregation of huntingtin and the selective pattern of striatal neuronal loss has been demonstrated, it is believed that other properties of the mutant huntingtin, like proteolysis and the interactions with other proteins that affect vesicular trafficking and nuclear transport, could be responsible for the neurodegeneration. On gross examination, 80% of HD brains show atrophy of the frontal lobes. A bilateral, symmetric atrophy of the striatum is observed in 95% of the HD brains. The mean brain weight in HD patients is approximately 30% lower than in normal individuals. Striatal degeneration has an ordered and topographic distribution. The tail of the caudate nucleus shows more degeneration than the head. The caudate atrophy is associated to a gradual atrophy and neuronal loss in other brain regions as the disease progresses. The striatal and cerebral cortex projection neurons are much more susceptible to the disease than interneurons. In the neostriatum, the levels of GABA, dynorphin and substance P are decreased, but the concentrations of somatostatin and neuropeptide Y increase. An impairment of energy metabolism in HD and a sensitivity to oxidative stress and to the cytotoxic effects of glutamate seem to contribute to the neuronal death in HD. It is proposed that melatonin should be assayed in cell cultures and in transgenic animals due to its potent antioxidant and free radical scavenger properties.
11080230	Subtle changes among presymptomatic carriers of the Huntington's disease gene.	OBJECTIVES: To compare the neurological and psychometric characteristics of presymptomatic gene carriers and non-gene carriers who are at risk for developing Huntington's disease so as to characterise early signs of disease and to identify markers of neurological function that could be used to assess the impact of experimental therapies on the progression of disease, even among those who are clinically presymptomatic. METHODS: A sample of people at risk for Huntington's disease was genotyped and evaluated using subscales of the Wechsler adult intelligence scale-revised (WAIS-R), a quantified neurological rating scale, and computerised physiological measures including speed of movement and reaction time. RESULTS: Genotyping and clinical examination determined that 171 participants were presymptomatic gene carriers (PSGCs) and 414 participants were non-gene carriers (NGCs). The PSGCs performed significantly worse when compared with the NGCs on the digit symbol, picture arrangement, and arithmetic subscales of the WAIS-R (p<0.02) and for the physiological measures: button tapping, auditory reaction time, visual reaction time with decision, and movement time with and without decision (p<0.05). Although no PSGCs had sufficient neurological findings to warrant a diagnosis of Huntington's disease on clinical examination, the PSGCs had more frequent possible or definite abnormality for oculomotor function, chorea, muscle stretch reflexes, gait, and station stability, and rapid alternating movements (p</=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Among Huntington's disease gene carriers, subtle cognitive and motor deficits precede the onset of sufficient neurological abnormality to warrant a clinical diagnosis of Huntington's disease.
11152661	Neurological abnormalities in a knock-in mouse model of Huntington's disease.	Mice representing precise genetic replicas of Huntington's disease (HD) were made using gene targeting to replace the short CAG repeat of the mouse Huntington's disease gene homolog (HDH:) with CAG repeats within the length range found to cause HD in humans. Mice with alleles of approximately 150 units in length exhibit late-onset behavioral and neuroanatomic abnormalities consistent with HD. These symptoms include a motor task deficit, gait abnormalities, reactive gliosis and the formation of neuronal intranuclear inclusions predominating in the striatum. This model differs from previously described HDH: knock-ins by its method of construction, longer repeat length and more severe phenotype. To our knowledge, this is the first knock-in mouse model of HD to show increased glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity in the striatum, suggesting that these mice have neuronal injury similar to that found early in the course of HD. These mice will serve as useful reagents in experiments designed to reveal the molecular nature of neuronal dysfunction underlying HD.
12191472	Proteases acting on mutant huntingtin generate cleaved products that differentially build up cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions.	Proteolytic processing of mutant huntingtin (mhtt) is regarded as a key event in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD). Mhtt fragments containing a polyglutamine expansion form intracellular inclusions and are more cytotoxic than full-length mhtt. Here, we report that two distinct mhtt fragments, termed cp-A and cp-B, differentially build up nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions in HD brain and in a cellular model for HD. Cp-A is released by cleavage of htt in a 10 amino acid domain and is the major fragment that aggregates in the nucleus. Furthermore, we provide evidence that cp-A and cp-B are most likely generated by aspartic endopeptidases acting in concert with the proteasome to ensure the normal turnover of htt. These proteolytic processes are thus potential targets for therapeutic intervention in HD.
12857955	Huntington disease expansion mutations in humans can occur before meiosis is completed.	Single-molecule DNA analysis of testicular germ cells isolated by laser capture microdissection from two Huntington disease patients showed that trinucleotide repeat expansion mutations were present before the end of the first meiotic division, and some mutations were present even before meiosis began. Most of the larger Huntington disease mutations were found in the postmeiotic cell population, suggesting that expansions may continue to occur during meiosis and/or after meiosis is complete. Defining the germ-line cell compartments where the trinucleotide repeat expansions occur could help to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of instability.
10441327	Aberrant interactions of transcriptional repressor proteins with the Huntington's disease gene product, huntingtin.	We detected an interaction of the N-terminus of huntingtin (htt171) with the C-terminal region of the nuclear receptor co-repressor (N-CoR) using the yeast two-hybrid system. This interaction was repeat length dependent and specific to htt171; the co-repressor did not interact with the repeat carrying a section of atrophin 1 nor with the androgen receptor or polyglutamine alone. The interaction was confirmed using His-tagged Escherichia coli -expressed C-terminal human and rat co-repressor protein which pulled full-length huntingtin out of homogenized rat brain and in pull-down assays. The N-CoR represses transcription from sequence-specific ligand-activated receptors such as the retinoid X-thyroid hormone receptor dimers and other nuclear receptors including Mad-Max receptor dimers. The mechanism of this repression appears to be through the formation of a complex of repressor proteins including the N-CoR, mSin3 and histone deacetylases. We have used N-CoR and mSin3A antibodies in immunohistochemical studies and find that in Huntington's disease (HD) cortex and caudate, the cellular localization of these proteins is exclusively cytoplasmic whilst in control brain they are localized in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm; mSin3A immunoreactivity also occurred in a subset of huntingtin positive intranuclear inclusions. The relocalization of repressor proteins in HD brain may alter transcription and be involved in the pathology of the disease.
10655548	Huntingtin is required for normal hematopoiesis.	Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin, a widely expressed protein. The function of huntingtin is unknown although huntingtin plays a fundamental role in development since gene targeted HD (-) (/-)mouse embryos die shortly after gastrulation. Expression of huntingtin is detected in spleen and thymus but its role in hematopoiesis has not been examined. To determine the function of huntingtin and to provide insight into potential pathologic mechanisms in HD, we analyzed the role of huntingtin in hematopoietic development. Expression of huntingtin was analyzed in a variety of hematopoietic cell types, and in vitro hematopoiesis was assessed using an HD ( +/-)and several HD( -) (/-)embryonic stem (ES) cell lines. Although wild-type, HD ( +/-)and HD( -) (/-)ES cell lines formed primary embryoid bodies (EBs) with similar efficiency, the numbers of hematopoietic progenitors detected at various stages of the in vitro differentiation were reduced in HD ( +/-)and HD( -/-)() ()ES cell lines examined. Expression analyses of hematopoietic markers within the EBs revealed that primitive and definitive hematopoiesis occurs in the absence of huntingtin. However, further analysis using a suspension culture in the presence of hematopoietic cytokines demonstrated a highly significant gene dosage-dependent decrease in proliferation and/or survival of HD ( +/-)and HD( -) (/-)cells. Enrichment for the CD34(+)cells within the EB confirmed that the impairment is intrinsic to the hematopoietic cells. These obser- vations suggest that huntingtin expression is required for the generation and expansion of hematopoietic cells and provides an alternative system in which to assess the function of huntingtin.
10970063	Recent advances in Huntington's disease.	Huntington's disease is a progressive and fatal neurological disorder caused by the expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in exon 1 of the gene coding for a protein of unknown function that has been named huntingtin. The exact cause of neuronal death in Huntington's disease is unknown; however, the leading hypothesis is that of excitotoxicity and apoptosis induced by a defect in energy metabolism that may be caused by oxidative stress. How mutant huntingtin might cause these processes is unknown. New animal and cell models provide insights into the mechanism of pathogenesis and the search for the development of effective therapies.
10974549	Human huntingtin-associated protein (HAP-1) gene: genomic organisation and an intragenic polymorphism.	The huntingtin-associated protein (HAP-1) interacts with the Huntington disease gene product, huntingtin. It is predominantly expressed in the brain and shows an increased affinity for mutant huntingtin. We have sequenced an 18,656bp genomic region encompassing the entire human HAP-1 gene and determined its genomic organisation, with 11 exons spanning 12.1kb. We have also found an intragenic polymorphism within intron 6 of HAP-1. We have recently shown that HAP-1 maps to a region of the genome which has been implicated in a variety of neurological conditions, including progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a late-onset atypical parkinsonian disorder. The detailed characterisation of the genomic organisation of HAP-1 and the presence of an intragenic polymorphism will be helpful in evaluating its role in different disorders, using candidate gene approaches.
11307307	[Clinical significance and strategies to analyze genetic polymorphisms].	A DNA polymorphism can be defined as a difference in the primary sequence of DNA, and the frequency of the rarer allele among the general population exceeds 1%. Several types of polymorphisms, including minisatellite and microsatellite markers, deletion or insertion of short nucleotide sequences, and single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs), are present in human genome, with different frequencies and different distribution patterns. SNPs are very common and clinically important, because they often appear within genes, particularly within coding sequences. The biological significance of a polymorphism differs significantly depending upon its location within the genome. For example, polymorphisms located outside genes usually do not have biological consequences, and will be used merely as markers for genetic linkage. On the other hand, those located within a gene may cause subtle changes in transcription, mRNA stability, or protein conformation if amino acid substitution occurs. These subtle changes in biologically important factors then alter susceptibility to certain disorders. Environmental factors often interact with genes. Relationships between genetic polymorphisms and disease susceptibility have been reported on many kinds of human diseases, including neurological and psychiatric disorders, infectious diseases, endocrine and metabolic disorders, malignancy, as well as cardiovascular diseases. Recent years have seen the progress in novel strategies for rapid genotyping of a large numbers of polymorphisms, and also, for searching unknown SNPs.
11319238	Polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin promotes sensitization of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors via post-synaptic density 95.	Increased glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (Tabrizi, S. J., Cleeter, M. W., Xuereb, J., Taaman, J. W., Cooper, J. M., and Schapira, A. H. (1999) Ann. Neurol. 45, 25-32). However, how polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin promotes glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity remains a mystery. In this study we provide evidence that (i) normal huntingtin is associated with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and kainate receptors via postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95), (ii) the SH3 domain of PSD-95 mediates its binding to huntingtin, and (iii) polyglutamine expansion interferes with the ability of huntingtin to interact with PSD-95. The expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin causes sensitization of NMDA receptors and promotes neuronal apoptosis induced by glutamate. The addition of the NMDA receptor antagonist significantly attenuates neuronal toxicity induced by glutamate and polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin. The overexpression of normal huntingtin significantly inhibits neuronal toxicity mediated by NMDA or kainate receptors. Our results demonstrate that polyglutamine expansion impairs the ability of huntingtin to bind PSD-95 and inhibits glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. These changes may be essential for the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease.
11532992	Polyglutamine expansions cause decreased CRE-mediated transcription and early gene expression changes prior to cell death in an inducible cell model of Huntington's disease.	Huntington's disease (HD) is one of 10 known diseases caused by a (CAG)(n) trinucleotide repeat expansion that is translated into an abnormally long polyglutamine tract. We have developed stable inducible neuronal (PC12) cell lines that express huntingtin exon 1 with varying CAG repeat lengths under doxycycline (dox) control. The expression of expanded repeats is associated with aggregate formation, caspase-dependent cell death and decreased neurite outgrowth. Post-mitotic cells expressing mutant alleles were more prone to cell death compared with identical cycling cells. To determine early metabolic changes induced by this mutation in cell models, we studied changes in gene expression after 18 h dox induction, using Affymetrix arrays, cDNA filters and adapter-tagged competitive PCR (ATAC-PCR). At this time point there were low rates of inclusion formation, no evidence of mitochondrial compromise and no excess cell death in the lines expressing expanded compared with wild-type repeats. The expression profiles suggest novel targets for the HD mutation and were compatible with impaired cAMP response element (CRE)-mediated transcription, which we confirmed using CRE-luciferase reporter assays. Reduced CRE-mediated transcription may contribute to the loss of neurite outgrowth and cell death in polyglutamine diseases, as these phenotypes were partially rescued by treating cells with cAMP or forskolin.
12200548	Identification of benzothiazoles as potential polyglutamine aggregation inhibitors of Huntington's disease by using an automated filter retardation assay.	Preventing the formation of insoluble polyglutamine containing protein aggregates in neurons may represent an attractive therapeutic strategy to ameliorate Huntington's disease (HD). Therefore, the ability to screen for small molecules that suppress the self-assembly of huntingtin would have potential clinical and significant research applications. We have developed an automated filter retardation assay for the rapid identification of chemical compounds that prevent HD exon 1 protein aggregation in vitro. Using this method, a total of 25 benzothiazole derivatives that inhibit huntingtin fibrillogenesis in a dose-dependent manner were discovered from a library of approximately 184,000 small molecules. The results obtained by the filter assay were confirmed by immunoblotting, electron microscopy, and mass spectrometry. Furthermore, cell culture studies revealed that 2-amino-4,7-dimethyl-benzothiazol-6-ol, a chemical compound similar to riluzole, significantly inhibits HD exon 1 aggregation in vivo. These findings may provide the basis for a new therapeutic approach to prevent the accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates in Huntington's disease and related glutamine repeat disorders.
12215844	Favourable mutation test outcomes for individuals at risk for Huntington disease change the perspectives of first-degree relatives.	In mutation testing for Huntington disease, an autosomal dominant hereditary late-onset disorder, unfavourable test outcomes in at-risk individuals provide important information about other family members at risk. On the other hand, common counselling practice considers favourable outcomes as non-informative for at-risk relatives, except for the offspring of the tested individual. We shall show, however, that favourable outcomes also change the perspectives for the tested individual's first-degree relatives at risk. In the case of a (prospective) parent originally at 50% risk, and with n equalling the number of children or fetuses identified as non-carriers, the probability of being a non-carrier equals 2 (n)/(2 (n)+1) for the at-risk parent, providing that none of the offspring of this parent has been identified as a carrier. Likewise, the probability of being a non-carrier equals (2 (n+1)+1)/(2 (n+1)+2) for the (future) siblings of the tested individual. These changes in probabilities are important for individuals who are considering prenatal or presymptomatic DNA-testing for autosomal dominant hereditary late-onset disorders, such as Huntington disease and hereditary forms of cancer (BRCA1/2, FAP, HNPCC). Consequences can be far reaching in the case of pregnancies, where the risk of miscarriage after a prenatal test is 1%-2%. Parents initially at 50% risk may consider not having a prenatal test in successive pregnancies, knowing that favourable test results in previous pregnancies have considerably reduced their personal risk.
12955844	Neural expression of the Huntington's disease gene as a chordate evolutionary novelty.	Huntington's disease is a progressive neuro-degenerative disorder in humans, which is scharacterized by onset of dementia, muscular ataxia, and death. Huntington's disease is caused by the expansion of the polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the N-terminus of the HD protein (Huntingtin). CAG expansion is a dominant gain of function mutation that affects striated neurons in the brain (Cattaneo, 2003, News Physiol Sci 18:34). The evolutionary origins of the vertebrate Hd gene are not well understood. In order to address the evolutionary history of the Hd gene, we have cloned and characterized the expression of the Hd gene in two invertebrate deuterostomes, an echinoderm and an ascidian, and have examined the expression patterns in a phylogenetic context. Echinoderms are basal deuterostomes and ascidians are basal chordates; both are useful for understanding the origins of and evolutionary trends in genes important in vertebrates such as the Huntigton's disease gene. Expression of Hd RNA is detected at all stages of development in both the echinoderm and ascidian studied. In the echinoderm Heliocidaris erythrogramma, Hd is expressed in coelomic mesodermal tissue derivatives, but not in the central nervous system. In the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi expression is located in both mesoderm and nervous tissue. We suggest that the primitive deuterostome expression pattern is not neural. Thus, neural expression of the Hd gene in deuterostomes may be a novel feature of the chordate lineage, and the original role(s) of HD in deuterostomes may have been non-neural.
8774958	The identification of a functional nuclear localization signal in the Huntington disease protein.	Positional cloning has shown that the Huntington disease (HD) mutation is an expanded trinucleotide repeat in the IT15 gene. Although this mutation clearly produces the HD phenotype, the function of the Huntington disease protein remains undefined. One recent immunocytochemical study suggested that the IT15 protein preferentially localizes to the nucleus of affected neuronal cells. If this result is accurate, it could link the biochemical function of this protein to nuclear activities such as gene regulation. To examine the nuclear transport of the Huntington disease protein, we searched for basic peptide motifs that could produce nuclear localization. One peptide (RRKGKEK) was identified that is highly homologous to a consensus nuclear localization signal. When fused to the cytoplasmic reporter protein, beta-galactosidase, nuclear localization was observed in stably transformed human cell lines. In a complementary study, an anti-peptide polyclonal antibody, raised against a sequence adjacent to the putative nuclear localization sequence, detected the IT15 protein in the nucleus of human cells. These results extend and confirm the previous localization studies and identify an IT15 peptide motif that can function for nuclear localization.
8858182	Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegeneration.	Rapid advances are being made in our understanding of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly those in which specific DNA mutations have been identified. beta-amyloid has been shown to induce free radical formation both directly and via an effect on endothelial function. There is presuasive evidence for cytochrome oxidase dysfunction with oxidative stress and damage in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The confirmation of the complex II inhibitor 3-nitropropionic acid as a toxin model for Huntington's disease, together with the demonstration of reduced mitochondrial function in Huntington's disease caudate, supports the proposition that mutant huntingtin may exert its effect through an abnormality of energy metabolism.
9700202	Huntingtin interacts with a family of WW domain proteins.	The hallmark neuropathology of Huntington's disease (HD) is due to elongation of a polyglutamine segment in huntingtin, a novel approximately 350 kDa protein of unknown function. We used a yeast two-hybrid interactor screen to identify proteins whose association with huntingtin might be altered in the pathogenic process. Surprisingly, no interactors were found with internal and C-terminal segments of huntingtin. In contrast, huntingtin's N-terminus detected 13 distinct proteins, seven novel and six reported previously. Among these, we identified a major interactor class, comprising three distinct WW domain proteins, HYPA, HYPB and HYPC, that bind normal and mutant huntingtin in extracts of HD lymphoblastoid cells. This interaction is mediated by huntingtin's proline-rich region and is enhanced by lengthening the adjacent glutamine tract. Although HYPB and HYPC are novel, HYPA is human FBP-11, a protein implicated in spliceosome function. The emergence of this class of proteins as huntingtin partners argues that a WW domain-mediated process, such as non-receptor signaling, protein degradation or pre-mRNA splicing, may participate in HD pathogenesis.
9725082	Advances in Huntington's disease: implications for experimental therapeutics.	The gene mutation causing Huntington's disease was identified in 1993 as an expanded trinucleotide repeat within the coding region for a 348-kd protein called huntingtin. The mechanism by which this cytosine-adenosine-guanosine repeat produces the progressive signs and symptoms of Huntington's disease remains uncertain, but recent advances have begun to provide insights into this process. Promising developments include transgenic mouse models of Huntington's disease with neuronal intranuclear inclusions, the identification of differential neuronal features which might account for the selective vulnerability of neurons seen in Huntington's disease and further evidence for the role of excitotoxicity and impaired mitochondrial energy production. These observations have suggested new therapeutic strategies, and have lent further support for experimental therapeutics aimed at improving mitochondrial function and reducing excitotoxic injury.
10196365	A Huntington's disease CAG expansion at the murine Hdh locus is unstable and associated with behavioural abnormalities in mice.	Huntington's disease (HD) is a dominant disorder characterized by premature and progressive neurodegeneration. In order to generate an accurate model of the disease, we introduced an HD-like mutation (an extended stretch of 72-80 CAG repeats) into the endogenous mouse Hdh gene. Analysis of the mutation in vivo reveals significant levels of germline instability, with expansions, contractions and sex-of-origin effects in evidence. Mice expressing full-length mutant protein display abnormal social behaviour in the absence of acute neurodegeneration. Given that psychiatric changes, including irritability and aggression, are common findings in HD patients, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that some clinical features of HD may be caused by pathological processes that precede gross neuronal cell death. This implies that effective treatment of HD may require an understanding and amelioration of these dysfunctional processes, rather than simply preventing the premature death of neurons in the brain. These mice should facilitate the investigation of the molecular mechanisms that underpin the pathway from genotype to phenotype in HD.
10434306	Analysis of the subcellular localization of huntingtin with a set of rabbit polyclonal antibodies in cultured mammalian cells of neuronal origin: comparison with the distribution of huntingtin in Huntington's disease autopsy brain.	Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a midlife onset. The disease is caused by expansion of a CAG (glutamine) repeat within the coding region of the HD gene. The molecular mechanism by which the mutated protein causes this disease is still unclear. To study the protein we have generated a set of rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against different segments of the N-terminal, central and C-terminal parts of the protein. The polyclonal antibodies were affinity purified and characterized in ELISA and Western blotting experiments. All antibodies can react with mouse and human proteins. The specificity of these antibodies is underscored by their recognition of huntingtin with different repeat sizes in extracts prepared from patient-derived lymphoblasts. The antibodies were used in immunofluorescence experiments to study the subcellular localization of huntingtin in mouse neuroblastoma NIE-115 cells. The results indicate that most huntingtin is present in the cytoplasm, whereas a minor fraction is present in the nucleus. On differentiation of the NIE-115 cells in vitro, the subcellular distribution of huntingtin does not change significantly. These results suggest that full-length huntingtin with a normal repeat length can be detected in the nucleus of cycling and non-cycling cultured mammalian cells of neuronal origin. However, in HD autopsy brain the huntingtin-containing neuronal intranuclear inclusions can be detected only with antibodies raised against the N-terminus of huntingtin. Thus several forms of huntingtin display the propensity for nuclear localization, possibly with different functional consequences.
11007884	Huntingtin expression stimulates endosomal-lysosomal activity, endosome tubulation, and autophagy.	An expansion of polyglutamines in the N terminus of huntingtin causes Huntington's disease (HD) and results in the accrual of mutant protein in the nucleus and cytoplasm of affected neurons. How mutant huntingtin causes neurons to die is unclear, but some recent observations suggest that an autophagic process may occur. We showed previously that huntingtin markedly accumulates in endosomal-lysosomal organelles of affected HD neurons and, when exogenously expressed in clonal striatal neurons, huntingtin appears in cytoplasmic vacuoles causing cells to shrink. Here we show that the huntingtin-enriched cytoplasmic vacuoles formed in vitro internalized the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D in proportion to the polyglutamine-length in huntingtin. Huntingtin-labeled vacuoles displayed the ultrastructural features of early and late autophagosomes (autolysosomes), had little or no overlap with ubiquitin, proteasome, and heat shock protein 70/heat shock cognate 70 immunoreactivities, and altered the arrangement of Golgi membranes, mitochondria, and nuclear membranes. Neurons with excess cytoplasmic huntingtin also exhibited increased tubulation of endosomal membranes. Exogenously expressed human full-length wild-type and mutant huntingtin codistributed with endogenous mouse huntingtin in soluble and membrane fractions, whereas human N-terminal huntingtin products were found only in membrane fractions that contained lysosomal organelles. We speculate that mutant huntingtin accumulation in HD activates the endosomal-lysosomal system, which contributes to huntingtin proteolysis and to an autophagic process of cell death.
8875248	Huntington disease: new insights into the relationship between CAG expansion and disease.	The mutation underlying Huntington disease (HD) is CAG expansion beyond 35 repeats within a novel gene. Recently, new insights into the role of the HD protein (huntingtin) in the pathogenesis of HD have emerged. The CAG is translated and expression of mutant huntingtin is essential for neuronal death. Huntingtin is crucial for normal development and may be regarded as a cell survival gene. Huntingtin is specifically cleaved during apoptosis by a key cysteine protease, apopain, known to play a pivotal role in apoptotic cell death. The rate of cleavage is enhanced by longer polyglutamine tracts, suggesting that inappropriate apoptosis underlies HD. Recently, three proteins have been identified and have been shown specifically to interact with huntingtin, two of these interactions being influenced by CAG length. Several different approaches to develop an animal model for HD include cDNA and YAC transgenics, as well as 'knock-in' strategies. Such a model will be critical for the understanding of the natural history of HD and for the testing of new therapeutic modalities.
10217265	Subtype-specific enhancement of NMDA receptor currents by mutant huntingtin.	Evidence suggests that NMDA receptor-mediated neurotoxicity plays a role in the selective neurodegeneration underlying Huntington's disease (HD). The gene mutation that causes HD encodes an expanded polyglutamine tract of >35 in huntingtin, a protein of unknown function. Both huntingtin and NMDA receptors interact with cytoskeletal proteins, and, for NMDA receptors, such interactions regulate surface expression and channel activity. To determine whether mutant huntingtin alters NMDA receptor expression or function, we coexpressed mutant or normal huntingtin, containing 138 or 15 glutamine repeats, respectively, with NMDA receptors in a cell line and then assessed receptor channel function by patch-clamp recording and surface expression by western blot analysis. It is interesting that receptors composed of NR1 and NR2B subunits exhibited significantly larger currents when coexpressed with mutant compared with normal huntingtin. Moreover, this effect was selective for NR1/NR2B, as NR1/NR2A showed similar currents when coexpressed with mutant versus normal huntingtin. However, ion channel properties and total surface expression of the NR1 subunit were unchanged in cells cotransfected with NR1/NR2B and mutant huntingtin. Our results suggest that mutant huntingtin may increase numbers of functional NR1/NR2B-type receptors at the cell surface. Because NR1/NR2B is the predominant NMDA receptor subtype expressed in medium spiny neostriatal neurons, our findings may help explain the selective vulnerability of these neurons in HD.
10434311	CAG repeat instability, cryptic sequence variation and pathogeneticity: evidence from different loci.	Different aspects of expanded polyglutamine tracts and of their pathogenetic role are taken into consideration here. (i) The (CAG)n length of wild-type alleles of the Huntington disease gene was analysed in instability-prone tumour tissue from colon cancer patients to test whether the process leading to the elongation of alleles towards the expansion range involves single-unit stepwise mutations or larger jumps. The analysis showed that length changes of a single unit had a relatively low frequency. (ii) The observation of an expanded spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)1 allele with an unusual pattern of multiple CAT interruptions showed that cryptic sequence variations are critical not only for sequence length stability but also for the expression of the disease phenotype. (iii) Small expansions of the (CAG)n sequence at the CACNA1A gene have been reported as causing SCA6. The analysis of families with SCA6 and episodic ataxia type 2 showed that these phenotypes are, in fact, expressions of the same disorder caused either by point mutations or by small (CAG)n expansions. A gain of function has been hypothesized for all proteins containing an expanded polyglutamine stretch, including the alpha 1A subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel type P/Q coded by the CACNA1A gene. Because point mutations at the same gene with similar phenotypic consequences are highly unlikely to have this effect, an alternative common pathogenetic mechanism for all these mutations, including small expansions, can be hypothesized.
10804212	Wild-type huntingtin protects from apoptosis upstream of caspase-3.	Expansion of a polyglutamine sequence in the N terminus of huntingtin is the gain-of-function event that causes Huntington's disease. This mutation affects primarily the medium-size spiny neurons of the striatum. Huntingtin is expressed in many neuronal and non-neuronal cell types, implying a more general function for the wild-type protein. Here we report that wild-type huntingtin acts by protecting CNS cells from a variety of apoptotic stimuli, including serum withdrawal, death receptors, and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologs. This protection may take place at the level of caspase-9 activation. The full-length protein also modulates the toxicity of the poly-Q expansion. Cells expressing full-length mutant protein are susceptible to fewer death stimuli than cells expressing truncated mutant huntingtin.
10828533	The pattern of neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease: a comparative study of cannabinoid, dopamine, adenosine and GABA(A) receptor alterations in the human basal ganglia in Huntington's disease.	In order to investigate the sequence and pattern of neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease, the distribution and density of cannabinoid CB(1), dopamine D(1) and D(2), adenosine A(2a) and GABA(A) receptor changes were studied in the basal ganglia in early (grade 0), intermediate (grades 1, 2) and advanced (grade 3) neuropathological grades of Huntington's disease. The results showed a sequential pattern of receptor changes in the basal ganglia with increasing neuropathological grades of Huntington's disease. First, the very early stages of the disease (grade 0) were characterized by a major loss of cannabinoid CB(1), dopamine D(2) and adenosine A(2a) receptor binding in the caudate nucleus, putamen and globus pallidus externus and an increase in GABA(A) receptor binding in the globus pallidus externus. Second, intermediate neuropathological grades (grades 1, 2) showed a further marked decrease of CB(1) receptor binding in the caudate nucleus and putamen; this was associated with a loss of D(1) receptors in the caudate nucleus and putamen and a loss of both CB(1) and D(1) receptors in the substantia nigra. Finally, advanced grades of Huntington's disease showed an almost total loss of CB(1) receptors and the further depletion of D(1) receptors in the caudate nucleus, putamen and globus pallidus internus, and an increase in GABA(A) receptor binding in the globus pallidus internus. These findings suggest that there is a sequential but overlapping pattern of neurodegeneration of GABAergic striatal efferent projection neurons in increasing neuropathological grades of Huntington's disease. First, GABA/enkephalin striatopallidal neurons projecting to the globus pallidus externus are affected in the very early grades of the disease. Second, GABA/substance P striatonigral neurons projecting to the substantia nigra are involved at intermediate neuropathological grades. Finally, GABA/substance P striatopallidal neurons projecting to the globus pallidus internus are affected in the late grades of the disease. In addition, the finding that cannabinoid receptors are dramatically reduced in all regions of the basal ganglia in advance of other receptor changes in Huntington's disease suggests a possible role for cannabinoids in the progression of neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease.
11030759	Dramatic mutation instability in HD mouse striatum: does polyglutamine load contribute to cell-specific vulnerability in Huntington's disease?	An unstable CAG triplet repeat expansion encoding a polyglutamine stretch within the ubiquitously expressed protein huntingtin is responsible for causing Huntington's disease (HD). By quantifying the repeat sizes of individual mutant alleles in tissues derived from an accurate genetic mouse model of HD we show that the mutation becomes very unstable in striatal tissue. The expansion-biased changes increase with age, such that some striatal cells from old HD mice contain mutations that have tripled in size. If this pattern of repeat instability is recapitulated in human striatal tissue, the concomitant increased polyglutamine load may contribute to the patterns of selective neuronal cell death in HD. Our findings also suggest that trinucleotide repeat instability can occur by mechanisms that are not replication-based.
11291528	Protein kinase C beta II mRNA levels decrease in the striatum and cortex of transgenic Huntington's disease mice.	Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by the inheritance of the huntingtin gene with an expanded CAG repeat. The function of the normal or mutant form of the huntingtin protein remains to be determined. We used differential display to determine differences in steady-state mRNA levels between wild-type and the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD. Using this method, we determined that the steady-state mRNA levels of protein kinase C beta II (PKC beta II) subunit are decreased in symptomatic HD mice compared with age-matched wild-type controls. The decrease in PKC beta II mRNA levels occurred in both the striatum and cortex. Previously, it had been demonstrated that PKC beta II immunoreactivity is decreased in the caudate-putamen of patients with Huntington's disease. PKC has been implicated in the long-term potentiation model of brain plasticity and learning, and the loss of PKC may affect information storage in HD. The expression of htt-HD throughout the brain affects the transcription of specific genes in regions not associated with widespread neurodegeneration.
12503842	Maintained improvement with minocycline of a patient with advanced Huntington's disease.	We present the case of a patient with advanced Huntington's disease treated with minocycline. Minocycline (but not tetracycline which does not cross the blood-brain barrier) appears to increase longevity in an animal model for Huntington's disease. The patient has been maintained on minocycline for more than 1 year with positive effects. Cessation of minocyclin for 3 weeks resulted in an exacerbation of symptoms. The animal studies have suggested that minocycline may prevent progression of Huntington's disease and other neurological disorders. By contrast, this present result suggests that minocycline may benefit those with advanced Huntington's disease and can be used safely in these patients.
14511117	Pro-apoptotic protein kinase C delta is associated with intranuclear inclusions in a transgenic model of Huntington's disease.	In order to investigate any effect of truncated mutant huntingtin (tNhtt) aggregation on protein kinase C (PKC) signaling in Huntington's disease (HD), we studied a possible association of PKC isoforms with the aggregates using cellular and transgenic models of HD. In this report we describe an association of mutant tNhtt with at least three PKC isoforms (alpha, delta, zeta), as revealed by co-immunoprecipitation assays and immunocytochemistry in a cellular model of HD (Neuro2a cells expressing tNhtt-150Q-EGFP), as well as a specific association of PKC delta with intranuclear aggregates in a transgenic model (R6/2 mice). Immunoblot analysis of isolated nuclear fractions shows an elevation of nuclear PKC delta in transgenic brain tissue. The observed elevation has a strong similarity with the apoptotic translocation of PKC delta detected in experiments with the mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells. Using a Neuro2a cell line expressing tNhtt with the nuclear localization signal, we demonstrate the association of PKC delta with intranuclear aggregates and present evidence that accumulation of PKC delta in cell nuclei does not depend on mutant htt nuclear translocation. Our results suggest that the association of PKC delta with intranuclear htt-aggregates may affect its apoptotic function in a transgenic model of HD.
14561870	Histone deacetylase inhibition by sodium butyrate chemotherapy ameliorates the neurodegenerative phenotype in Huntington's disease mice.	The precise cause of neuronal death in Huntington's disease (HD) is unknown. Although no single specific protein-protein interaction of mutant huntingtin has emerged as the pathologic trigger, transcriptional dysfunction may contribute to the neurodegeneration observed in HD. Pharmacological treatment using the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate to modulate transcription significantly extended survival in a dose-dependent manner, improved body weight and motor performance, and delayed the neuropathological sequelae in the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD. Sodium butyrate also increased histone and Specificity protein-1 acetylation and protected against 3-nitropropionic acid neurotoxicity. Microarray analysis showed increased expression of alpha- and beta-globins and MAP kinase phosphatase-1 in sodium butyrate-treated R6/2 mice, indicative of improved oxidative phosphorylation and transcriptional regulation. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that transcriptional dysfunction plays a role in the pathogenesis of HD and suggest that therapies aimed at modulating transcription may target early pathological events and provide clinical benefits to HD patients.
7635477	Somatic stability in chorionic villi samples and other Huntington fetal tissues.	We have studied different tissues from two affected fetuses with Huntington's disease (HD). In the first case the analysis was performed at 11 weeks of pregnancy; CAG repeats from seven different tissues were compared with the results obtained in the chorionic villi sample (CVS). We found 42 CAG repeats in all samples. In the second case the study was done at 12 weeks; eight tissues (including brain) were studied and compared with the CVS; in all of them, 44 CAG repeats were obtained. Our results show a somatic stability in the different analyzed tissues and suggest that mitotic instability can be a secondary consequence of neuronal degeneration and gliosis. Likewise, our data show great viability in the prenatal diagnosis (PD) of Huntington's disease using samples from any tissue.
10222786	[Huntington's disease: clinical and molecular genetics].	"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. An unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion within the first exon of the responsible gene ""IT15"", encoding huntingtin, was identified. The clinical phenotype strongly correlates with the number of CAG repeat. The mutant huntingtin is expressed ubiquitously as same as the wild-type huntingtin, suggesting a toxic gain of function of the mutant huntingtin. The identification of huntingtin-interacting proteins and intranuclear aggregates containing a fragment of mutant huntingtin provide new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HD. Moreover, the progress in transgenic animal models for HD will be critical for understanding the development of HD and for the testing of new therapeutics."
10941183	Transcriptional dysregulation in Huntington's disease.	Although the gene responsible for Huntington's disease was discovered in 1993, the pathogenic mechanisms by which mutant huntingtin causes neuronal dysfunction and death remain unclear. However, increasing evidence suggests that mutant huntingtin disrupts the normal transcriptional program of susceptible neurons. Thus, transcriptional dysregulation might be an important pathogenic mechanism in Huntington's disease.
11139734	[Huntington disease in Burkina Faso].	Four cases of Huntington's disease in two families seen in Burkino Faso, a country in western Africa, are described. All four patients were black Africans aged 43, 42, 38 and 33 years. The clinical presentation was typical with chorea and episodes of psychiatric disorders. Molecular genetics of one family showed abnormal expansion of CAG repeats on IT15 in three patients. Separate mutations are likely to be the origin of Huntington's disease in Burkino Faso.
11393535	Seventy genetic variations in human microsomal and soluble epoxide hydrolase genes (EPHX1 and EPHX2) in the Japanese population.	Human microsomal and soluble epoxide hydrolases (mEH and sEH) are enzymes that metabolize xenobiotic molecules. We screened DNA from 48 Japanese individuals for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in both genes by direct sequencing of the entire genomic regions containing EPHX1 and EPHX2, except for repetitive elements. This approach identified 33 SNPs in the EPHX1 gene; 6 of them were located in the 5' flanking region, 17 in introns, 8 in exons, and 2 in the 3' flanking region. In the EPHX2 gene, we identified 36 SNPs, including 4 in the 5' flanking region, 24 in introns, 5 in exons, and 3 in the 3' flanking region, as well as one insertion/deletion polymorphism in the 5' flanking region. These variants may contribute to a more precise understanding of the nature of correlations between genotypes and disease-susceptibility phenotypes that have been postulated in regard to human microsomal and soluble epoxide hydrolases.
11604514	Huntingtin interacting protein 1 Is a clathrin coat binding protein required for differentiation of late spermatogenic progenitors.	Huntingtin-interacting protein 1 (HIP1) interacts with huntingtin, the protein whose gene is mutated in Huntington's disease. In addition, a fusion between HIP1 and platelet-derived growth factor beta receptor causes chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The HIP1 proteins, including HIP1 and HIP1-related (HIP1r), have an N-terminal polyphosphoinositide-interacting epsin N-terminal homology, domain, which is found in proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. HIP1 and HIP1r also share a central leucine zipper and an actin binding TALIN homology domain. Here we show that HIP1, like HIP1r, colocalizes with clathrin coat components. We also show that HIP1 physically associates with clathrin and AP-2, the major components of the clathrin coat. To further understand the putative biological role(s) of HIP1, we have generated a targeted deletion of murine HIP1. HIP1(-/-) mice developed into adulthood, did not develop overt neurologic symptoms in the first year of life, and had normal peripheral blood counts. However, HIP1-deficient mice exhibited testicular degeneration with increased apoptosis of postmeiotic spermatids. Postmeiotic spermatids are the only cells of the seminiferous tubules that express HIP1. These findings indicate that HIP1 is required for differentiation, proliferation, and/or survival of spermatogenic progenitors. The association of HIP1 with clathrin coats and the requirement of HIP1 for progenitor survival suggest a role for HIP1 in the regulation of endocytosis.
12528814	Transglutaminase cross-links in intranuclear inclusions in Huntington disease.	Cortical and striatal perinuclear cytoplasmic aggregates and intranuclear inclusions of mutant huntingtin are neuropathological hallmarks of Huntington disease (HD). Although the mechanisms involved in the formation of these aggregates are unclear, a recent hypothesis implicates cross-linking of mutant huntingtin protein into aggregates by transglutaminase. This study explores the hypothesis that transglutaminase catalyzes cross-linking of huntingtin into intranuclear inclusions. Using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy we demonstrate 99% colocalization of transglutaminase-catalyzed epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl) lysine covalent cross-links with nuclear aggregates of huntingtin protein in the frontal cortex of postmortem HD brain tissue. Furthermore, the transglutaminase 2 isoform colocalizes with both huntingtin protein and epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl) lysine covalent cross-links in HD intranuclear inclusions. Transient transfection of N-terminally truncated huntingtin with an expanded glutamine domain (htt-N63-148Q-myc) with and without and transglutaminase 2 into HEK 293T cells resulted in an increase in cross-linked huntingtin in the insoluble formic acid-treated pellet in comparison to transfection of N-terminally truncated huntingtin with normal length glutamine domain (htt-N63-18Q-myc). Transfection with both htt-N63-148Q-myc and transglutaminase 2 resulted in high molecular weight huntingtin in the insoluble fraction. These data support the hypothesis that transglutaminase catalyzed cross-linking of mutant huntingtin is involved in the formation and/or stabilization of huntingtin protein aggregates in HD. Based on these and other studies, modulation of transglutaminase activity could be explored as a treatment for HD.
12531510	Insoluble TATA-binding protein accumulation in Huntington's disease cortex.	Huntington's disease is a dominantly inherited neurological disorder where specific neurodegeneration is caused by an extended polyglutamine stretch in the huntingtin protein. Proteins with expanded polyglutamine regions have the ability to self-aggregate and previous work in our laboratory, and by others, revealed sparse amyloid-like deposits in the Huntington's disease brain, supporting the hypothesis that the polyglutamine stretches may fold into regular beta-sheet structures. This process of folding has similarities to other neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and the prion diseases which all exhibit beta-sheet protein accumulation. We were therefore interested in testing the hypothesis that TATA-binding protein may play a role in Huntington's disease as it contains an elongated polymorphic polyglutamine stretch that ranges in size from 26 to 42 amino acids in normal individuals. A proportion of TBP alleles fall within the range of glutamine length that causes neurodegeneration when located in the huntingtin protein. In this study the distribution and cellular localisation of TATA-binding protein was compared to the distribution and cellular localisation of the huntingtin protein in the middle frontal gyrus of Huntington's disease and neurologically normal subjects. Seven different morphological forms of TATA-binding protein-positive structures were detected in Huntington's disease but not in control brain. TATA-binding protein labelling was relatively more abundant than huntingtin labelling and increased with the grade of the disease. At least a proportion of this accumulated TBP exists as insoluble protein. This suggests that TBP may play a role in the disease process.
12700167	Raised intracellular glucose concentrations reduce aggregation and cell death caused by mutant huntingtin exon 1 by decreasing mTOR phosphorylation and inducing autophagy.	Huntington's disease is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion that is translated into an abnormally long polyglutamine tract. This gain-of-function mutation is associated with huntingtin aggregation and cell death. Autophagy is an important clearance route for mutant huntingtin exon 1. While mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of autophagy, the upstream modifiers of this process are poorly understood. Our previous expression profiling studies in HD cell models observed changes in four genes associated with glucose metabolism, including the GLUT1 glucose transporter. A role for intracellular glucose as a modulator for polyglutamine toxicity was suggested as cell death was reduced by GLUT1 overexpression. Here we show that the protective effect of GLUT1 is associated with decreased huntingtin exon 1 aggregation in cell models. Consistent with this result, we also observed reduced aggregation and enhanced clearance of mutant huntingtin when cells were cultured in raised glucose concentrations (8 g/l). These effects were mimicked by 8 g/l 2-deoxyglucose (2DOG) (transported, phosphorylated but not metabolized further), but not with 8 g/l 3-O-methyl glucose (transported but not metabolized further). Thus, this phenomenon is probably mediated by glucose-6-phosphate. Increased clearance of mutant huntingtin by raised glucose (8 g/l) and 2DOG correlated with increased autophagy and reduced phosphorylation of mTOR, S6K1 and Akt. Thus, raised intracellular glucose/glucose 6-phosphate levels reduce mutant huntingtin toxicity by increasing autophagy via mTOR and possibly Akt. As mTOR and Akt regulate a diversity of crucial cellular processes, our data also suggest a major new set of targets for intracellular glucose signalling.
7944295	Trinucleotide repeat length and rate of progression of Huntington's disease.	The Huntington's disease gene contains an expanded unstable (CAG)n repeat, and the repeat lengths have been shown to correlate with the age of onset. Using detailed clinical scales, we evaluated the rate of progression of Huntington's disease and its relationship to the number of triplet repeats. We found significant positive correlation between the rate of progression of clinical symptoms (both neurological and psychiatric) and CAG repeat length. These data suggest an important role of expanded trinucleotide repeat length in affecting the pathological process during the entire course of Huntington's disease.
9510215	Neuronal and glial somal size in the prefrontal cortex: a postmortem morphometric study of schizophrenia and Huntington disease.	BACKGROUND: The cortex of patients with schizophrenia exhibits a deficit in neuropil, but the nature and extent of cellular abnormalities remain unclear. To gain further insight into this abnormality, neuronal and glial somal size were analyzed in postmortem brains from 9 patients with schizophrenia, 10 normal (control) patients, and 7 patients with Huntington disease, the latter representing a known neurodegenerative disorder. METHODS: A 3-dimensional image analyzer was used to measure the perimeters of 10722 neuronal and 19913 glial profiles in Brodmann areas 9 and 17. Neurons and glia were classified by size and layer to assess specific vulnerabilities with respect to cortical architecture and circuitry. RESULTS: The schizophrenic prefrontal cortex was characterized by a downward shift in neuronal sizes accompanied by 70% to 140% per layer increases in the density of small neurons. In layer III only, a significant reduction in mean neuronal size was associated with a significant decrease in the density of very large neurons in sublayer Illc. Neither neuronal size in occipital area 17 nor glial size in prefrontal or occipital cortexes were reduced. In cortex with Huntington disease, neuronal degeneration was evidenced by concurrence of reduced neuronal size, decreased density of large neurons, and dramatic elevation in density of large glia. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct cytometric abnormalities support the hypothesis that neuronal degeneration in the prefrontal cortex is not a prominent feature of the neuropathological changes in schizophrenia, although an ongoing process in Huntington disease. Rather, schizophrenia appears to involve more subtle abnormalities, with the largest corticocortical projection neurons of layer IIIc expressing the greatest somal reduction.
10353249	Inhibition of caspase-1 slows disease progression in a mouse model of Huntington's disease.	Huntington's disease is an autosomal-dominant progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting in specific neuronal loss and dysfunction in the striatum and cortex. The disease is universally fatal, with a mean survival following onset of 15-20 years and, at present, there is no effective treatment. The mutation in patients with Huntington's disease is an expanded CAG/polyglutamine repeat in huntingtin, a protein of unknown function with a relative molecular mass of 350,000 (M(r) 350K). The length of the CAG/polyglutamine repeat is inversely correlated with the age of disease onset. The molecular pathways mediating the neuropathology of Huntington's disease are poorly understood. Transgenic mice expressing exon 1 of the human huntingtin gene with an expanded CAG/polyglutamine repeat develop a progressive syndrome with many of the characteristics of human Huntington's disease. Here we demonstrate evidence of caspase-1 activation in the brains of mice and humans with the disease. In this transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease, expression of a dominant-negative caspase-1 mutant extends survival and delays the appearance of neuronal inclusions, neurotransmitter receptor alterations and onset of symptoms, indicating that caspase-1 is important in the pathogenesis of the disease. In addition, we demonstrate that intracerebroventricular administration of a caspase inhibitor delays disease progression and mortality in the mouse model of Huntington's disease.
11738470	Evidence for a role for transglutaminase in Huntington's disease and the potential therapeutic implications.	Transglutaminase (TGase) activity is increased in affected regions of brains from patients with Huntington's disease (HD). TGase activity is particularly elevated in the nucleus compared with the cytoplasm from these brains. Gamma-glutaminyl-lysyl cross-links have been detected in nuclear inclusions in HD brain, indicating that TGase may play a prominent role in the aggregation of huntingtin (htt). Attempts to ameliorate experimental disease, via inhibition of TGase in transgenic models of HD in mice, are under investigation.
11978824	Lentiviral-mediated delivery of mutant huntingtin in the striatum of rats induces a selective neuropathology modulated by polyglutamine repeat size, huntingtin expression levels, and protein length.	A new strategy based on lentiviral-mediated delivery of mutant huntingtin (htt) was used to create a genetic model of Huntington's disease (HD) in rats and to assess the relative contribution of polyglutamine (CAG) repeat size, htt expression levels, and protein length on the onset and specificity of the pathology. Lentiviral vectors coding for the first 171, 853, and 1520 amino acids of wild-type (19 CAG) or mutant htt (44, 66, and 82 CAG) driven by either the phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK) or the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoters were injected in rat striatum. A progressive pathology characterized by sequential appearance of ubiquitinated htt aggregates, loss of dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa staining, and cell death was observed over 6 months with mutant htt. Earlier onset and more severe pathology occurred with shorter fragments, longer CAG repeats, and higher expression levels. Interestingly, the aggregates were predominantly located in the nucleus of PGK-htt171-injected rats, whereas they were present in both the nucleus and processes of CMV-htt171-injected animals expressing lower transgene levels. Finally, a selective sparing of interneurons was observed in animals injected with vectors expressing mutant htt. These data demonstrate that lentiviral-mediated expression of mutant htt provides a robust in vivo genetic model for selective neural degeneration that will facilitate future studies on the pathogenesis of cell death and experimental therapeutics for HD.
12620967	Transgenic rat model of Huntington's disease.	Huntington's disease (HD) is a late manifesting neurodegenerative disorder in humans caused by an expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat of more than 39 units in a gene of unknown function. Several mouse models have been reported which show rapid progression of a phenotype leading to death within 3-5 months (transgenic models) resembling the rare juvenile course of HD (Westphal variant) or which do not present with any symptoms (knock-in mice). Owing to the small size of the brain, mice are not suitable for repetitive in vivo imaging studies. Also, rapid progression of the disease in the transgenic models limits their usefulness for neurotransplantation. We therefore generated a rat model transgenic of HD, which carries a truncated huntingtin cDNA fragment with 51 CAG repeats under control of the native rat huntingtin promoter. This is the first transgenic rat model of a neurodegenerative disorder of the brain. These rats exhibit adult-onset neurological phenotypes with reduced anxiety, cognitive impairments, and slowly progressive motor dysfunction as well as typical histopathological alterations in the form of neuronal nuclear inclusions in the brain. As in HD patients, in vivo imaging demonstrates striatal shrinkage in magnetic resonance images and a reduced brain glucose metabolism in high-resolution fluor-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography studies. This model allows longitudinal in vivo imaging studies and is therefore ideally suited for the evaluation of novel therapeutic approaches such as neurotransplantation.
12747895	Huntingtin aggregation and toxicity in Huntington's disease.	CONTEXT: Huntington's disease is a late onset neurodegenerative disorder for which the mutation is a CAG/polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion in the gene encoding the huntingtin protein. The disease is one of nine inherited neurodegenerative disorders that are caused by this type of mutation, and which include dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, and the spinocerebellar ataxias 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17. The mutant proteins are unrelated except for the polyQ tract, and aggregated polyQ is a major component of the proteinaceous deposits that are found in patients' brains for all of these diseases. STARTING POINT: Since the discovery of polyQ aggregates, the proposed role of the aggregation process has ranged from being central to disease pathogenesis, to a benign epiphenomenon, or even to being neuroprotective. Attempts to correlate the presence of aggregates with the onset of phenotype have been complicated by the difficulties in detecting and quantifying small aggregated forms of polyQ, and because all possible structural conformers of the repeat are present in the system under analysis. A paper by W Yang and colleagues (Hum Mol Genet 2002; 11: 2905-17) circumvents these limitations and demonstrates that preformed polyQ aggregates are highly toxic when directed to the cell nucleus. Consistent with aggregate toxicity, pharmacological intervention aimed at inhibiting aggregate formation has recently shown beneficial effects in a mouse model of Huntington's disease (I Sanchez and colleagues, Nature 2003; 421: 373-79). WHERE NEXT: The demonstration that polyQ aggregates are toxic is important because it further validates polyQ aggregation as a therapeutic target. To exploit this finding fully, greater understanding of the formation and structure of polyQ aggregates is needed. However, even without this knowledge, establishing high-throughput screens to identify aggregation inhibitors has been straightforward, and early in-vivo experiments that target aggregation have been promising. As the molecular events that contribute to the early stages of the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease are uncovered, such events will be developed as therapeutic targets. The inhibition of huntingtin aggregation should be a major focus in this effort and the practicalities of this approach are likely to unfold over the next 5-10 years.
8692996	Ciliary neurotrophic factor protects striatal output neurons in an animal model of Huntington disease.	Huntington disease is a dominantly inherited, untreatable neurological disorder featuring a progressive loss of striatal output neurons that results in dyskinesia, cognitive decline, and, ultimately, death. Neurotrophic factors have recently been shown to be protective in several animal models of neurodegenerative disease, raising the possibility that such substances might also sustain the survival of compromised striatal output neurons. We determined whether intracerebral administration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, neurotrophin-3, or ciliary neurotrophic factor could protect striatal output neurons in a rodent model of Huntington disease. Whereas treatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, or neurotrophin-3 provided no protection of striatal output neurons from death induced by intrastriatal injection of quinolinic acid, an N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor agonist, treatment with ciliary neurotrophic factor afforded marked protection against this neurodegenerative insult.
8813217	Hypokinesia in Huntington's disease.	Motor activity was quantitatively assessed over a period of 5 days using a wrist-worn activity monitor in 14 patients with Huntington's disease (of whom 4 used neuroleptic drugs) and 14 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Additionally, patients were rated for dementia, depression, clinical impairment of motor tasks, chorea, and disability. A significant decrease in daytime motor activity was observed in patients compared with controls, suggesting hypokinesia rather than hyperkinesia. Hypokinesia tended to be more severe in patients using neuroleptic drugs. Lower activity levels were significantly related to lower scores of functional disability, but not to other clinical measures. We conclude that hypokinesia is a prominent manifestation in Huntington's disease that is worsened by the use of neuroleptics.
9285789	Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) binds to a Trio-like polypeptide, with a rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain.	Huntington's disease (HD) occurs when the widely expressed protein huntingtin contains an expanded glutamine repeat. The selective degeneration and neuronal morphologic abnormalities of HD may involve interactions with proteins that bind to huntingtin, such as HAP1. The biological significance of this interaction is unclear because neither HAP1 nor huntingtin have significant homology to known proteins. Therefore, we sought to identify HAP1-binding proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we isolated a rat cDNA encoding part of a protein that interacts with HAP1, and we confirmed the specificity of this interaction using an in vitro protein-binding assay. We called the protein Duo because it is closely related to the human protein Trio but is shorter. Northern blot analysis indicates brain-specific expression of Duo. Human Duo contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain that is likely to be rac1-specific, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and spectrin-like repeat units. These data support the hypothesis that huntingtin is involved in vesicle trafficking and cytoskeletal functions, and raise the possibility of a role for huntingtin in the regulation of a ras-related signaling pathway.
10354600	Recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease.	Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal, dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by abnormal involuntary movements (chorea), intellectual impairment and selective neuronal loss. The expansion of a polymorphic trinucleotide repeat (the sequence CAG that codes for glutamine) to a length that exceeds 40 repeat units in exon 1 of the gene, HD, correlates with the onset and progression of the disease. The protein encoded by HD, huntingtin, is normally localized in the cytoplasm, whereas the mutant protein is also found in the nucleus, suggesting that its translocation to this site is important for the pathogenesis of HD. Although several proteins that interact with huntingtin have been identified in vitro, the significance of these interactions with the mutant protein in the pathogenesis of HD has yet to be determined. Recent progress in the development of cellular and animal models for the disease have provided invaluable insights and resources for studying the disease mechanisms underlying HD, and will be useful for screening and evaluating possible therapeutic strategies.
10397764	Sla2p is associated with the yeast cortical actin cytoskeleton via redundant localization signals.	Sla2p, also known as End4p and Mop2p, is the founding member of a widely conserved family of actin-binding proteins, a distinguishing feature of which is a C-terminal region homologous to the C terminus of talin. These proteins may function in actin cytoskeleton-mediated plasma membrane remodeling. A human homologue of Sla2p binds to huntingtin, the protein whose mutation results in Huntington's disease. Here we establish by immunolocalization that Sla2p is a component of the yeast cortical actin cytoskeleton. Deletion analysis showed that Sla2p contains two separable regions, which can mediate association with the cortical actin cytoskeleton, and which can provide Sla2p function. One localization signal is actin based, whereas the other signal is independent of filamentous actin. Biochemical analysis showed that Sla2p exists as a dimer in vivo. Two-hybrid analysis revealed two intramolecular interactions mediated by coiled-coil domains. One of these interactions appears to underlie dimer formation. The other appears to contribute to the regulation of Sla2p distribution between the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. The data presented are used to develop a model for Sla2p regulation and interactions.
10713390	Expression of the Huntingtin-associated protein 1 gene in the developing and adult mouse.	Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) interacts with the product of the Huntington's disease gene. To investigate the function of Hap1 in development and in the adult mouse, we have examined the expression of Hap1 by northern analysis and in situ hybridization histochemistry. Hap1 expression is first detected in the embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) neuroepithelium. Expression persists throughout development, predominantly in the brain and spinal cord, and to a lesser extent in enteric neurons and abdominal sympathetic ganglia. In the adult, Hap1 expression is detected not only in the brain but also in the ovary, testis, and the intermediate lobe of the pituitary.
12969257	Depletion of wild-type huntingtin in mouse models of neurologic diseases.	Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding for huntingtin resulting in selective neuronal degeneration. Because HD is an autosomal dominant disorder, affected individuals have one copy of the mutant and one copy of the wild-type allele. Huntingtin has antiapoptotic properties and is critical for cell survival. However, the important role of wild-type huntingtin in both HD and other neurological diseases has not been fully recognized. We demonstrate disease-associated decreased levels of full-length huntingtin in brains of transgenic mouse models of HD, ischemia, trauma, and in spinal cord after injury. In addition, overexpression of wild-type huntingtin confers in vivo protection of neurodegeneration after ischemia. We propose that in HD, in addition to a toxic gain-of-function of mutant huntingtin, a parallel depletion of wild-type huntingtin results in a detrimental loss-of-function, playing an important role in disease progression.
13679594	How does the Huntington's disease mutation damage cells?	Huntington's Disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative condition with devastating consequences. HD is caused by the expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat stretch in the coding sequence of the HD gene that gives rise to a long polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. How this mutated protein gives rise to the disease state is controversial. In this Perspective, I discuss the results of a new study on the effects of the mutated huntingtin protein in light of previous findings and suggest that the HD mutation damages cells by perturbing multiple parallel pathways by gain-of-function and possibly also dominant negative mechanisms.
9666478	Intranuclear neuronal inclusions in Huntington's disease and dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy: correlation between the density of inclusions and IT15 CAG triplet repeat length.	Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by CAG triplet repeat expansion in IT15 which leads to polyglutamine stretches in the HD protein product, huntingtin. The pathological hallmark of HD is the degeneration of subsets of neurons, primarily those in the striatum and neocortex. Specific morphological markers of affected cells have not been identified in patients with HD, although a unique itranuclear inclusion was recently reported in neurons of transgenic animals expressing a construct encoding the N-terminal part (including the glutamine repeat) of huntingtin (Davies et al., 1997). In order to understand the importance of this finding, we sought for comparable nuclear abnormalities in autopsy material from patients with HD. In all 20 HD cases examined, anti-ubiquitin and N-terminal huntingtin antibodies identified itranuclear inclusions in neurons and the frequency of these lesions correlated with the length of the CAG repeat in IT15. In addition, examination of material from the related HD-like triplet repeat disorder, dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy, also revealed intranuclear neuronal inclusions. These findings suggest that intranuclear inclusions containing protein aggregates may be common feature of the pathogenesis of glutamine repeat neurodegenerative disorders.
9823684	Juvenile Huntington's disease: report of one case.	Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by mutation of the IT 15gene (chromosome 4p16.3), with elongation of (CAG) n repeats. Most juvenile Huntington disease patients acquire the genetic defect through paternal transmission due to amplification of the repeat number during spermatogenesis, and thus causing early age of disease onset and increased disease severity. We here report one case that instead of choreoathetosis presents symptoms of developmental regression, such as seizure and rigid/bradykinesia. EEG showed occipital dominant 4-5 Hz high-amplitude spike-wave activities. MRI showed advanced atrophy and abnormal increase in signal intensity on T2-weighted and proton-density-weighted images of the caudate nuclei and putamina early in the course. The clinical diagnosis is confirmed by PCR study of HD (CAG) n repeats. This is the first case of juvenile Hunington's disease reported in Taiwan.
10377424	Transglutaminase aggregates huntingtin into nonamyloidogenic polymers, and its enzymatic activity increases in Huntington's disease brain nuclei.	The protein huntingtin (htt), aggregated in neuronal nuclear inclusions, is pathognomonic of Huntington's disease (HD). Constructs, translated in vitro from the N terminus of htt, containing either polyQ23 from a normal individual, or polyQ41 or polyQ67 from an HD patient, were all soluble. Transglutaminase (TGase) crosslinked these proteins, and the aggregations did not have the staining properties of amyloid. More TGase-catalyzed aggregates formed when the polyglutamine domain of htt exceeded the pathologic threshold of polyQ36. Furthermore, shorter htt constructs, containing 135 aa or fewer, formed more aggregates than did larger htt constructs. TGase activity in the HD brain was increased compared with the control, with notable increases in cell nuclei. The increased TGase activity was brain specific. In lymphoblastoid cells from HD patients, TGase activity was decreased. TGase-mediated crosslinking of htt may be involved in the formation of the nonamyloidogenic nuclear inclusions found in the HD brain. The staining properties of nuclear inclusions in the HD brain revealed that they were not amyloid.
11036200	Amyloid-like inclusions in Huntington's disease.	Huntington's disease is a progressive, autosomal dominantly inherited, neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by involuntary movements (chorea), cognitive decline and psychiatric manifestations. This is one of a number of late-onset neurodegenerative disorders caused by expanded glutamine repeats, with a likely similar biochemical basis. Immunohistochemical studies on Huntington's disease tissue, using antibodies raised to the N-terminal region of huntingtin (adjacent to the repeat) and ubiquitin, have recently identified neuronal inclusions within densely stained neuronal nuclei, peri-nuclear and within dystrophic neuritic processes. However, the functional significance of inclusions is unknown. It has been suggested that the disease-causing mechanism in Huntington's disease (and the other polyglutamine disorders) is the ability of polyglutamine to undergo a conformational change that can lead to the formation of very stable anti-parallel beta-sheets; more specifically, amyloid structures. We examined, using Congo Red staining and both polarizing and confocal microscopy, post mortem human brain tissue from five Huntington's disease cases, two Alzheimer's disease cases and two normal controls. Brains from five transgenic mice (R6/2)(12) expressing exon 1 of the human huntingtin gene with expanded polyglutamine, and five littermate controls, were also examined by the same techniques. We have shown that some inclusions in Huntington's disease brain tissue possess an amyloid-like structure, suggesting parallels with other amyloid-associated diseases such as Alzheimer's and prion diseases.
11063258	HIP12 is a non-proapoptotic member of a gene family including HIP1, an interacting protein with huntingtin.	Huntingtin-interacting protein I (HIP1) is a membrane-associated protein that interacts with huntingtin, the protein altered in Huntington disease. HIP1 shows homology to Sla2p, a protein essential for the assembly and function of the cytoskeleton and endocytosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have determined that the HIP1 gene comprises 32 exons spanning approximately 215 kb of genomic DNA and gives rise to two alternate splice forms termed HIP1-1 and HIP1-2. Additionally, we have identified a novel protein termed HIP12 with significant sequence and biochemical similarities to HIP1 and high sequence similarity to Sla2p. HIP12 differs from HIP1 in its pattern of expression both at the mRNA and protein level. However, HIP1 and HIP12 are both found within the brain and show a similar subcellular distribution pattern. In contrast to HIP1, which is toxic in cell culture, HIP12 does not confer toxicity in the same assay systems. Interestingly, HIP12 does not interact with huntingtin but can interact with HIP1. suggesting a potential interaction in vivo that may influence the function of each respective protein.
8574575	Huntington's disease. Their loss is our gain?	'Knockout' mice have been developed that lack the Huntington's disease gene, in an effort to gain insight into the disorder and into the pathophysiological effects of tri-nucleotide repeat expansion.
9768849	Polyglutamine-expanded human huntingtin transgenes induce degeneration of Drosophila photoreceptor neurons.	Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder. Disease alleles contain a trinucleotide repeat expansion of variable length, which encodes polyglutamine tracts near the amino terminus of the HD protein, huntingtin. Polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin, but not normal huntingtin, forms nuclear inclusions. We describe a Drosophila model for HD. Amino-terminal fragments of human huntingtin containing tracts of 2, 75, and 120 glutamine residues were expressed in photoreceptor neurons in the compound eye. As in human neurons, polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin induced neuronal degeneration. The age of onset and severity of neuronal degeneration correlated with repeat length, and nuclear localization of huntingtin presaged neuronal degeneration. In contrast to other cell death paradigms in Drosophila, coexpression of the viral antiapoptotic protein, P35, did not rescue the cell death phenotype induced by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin.
10402204	A YAC mouse model for Huntington's disease with full-length mutant huntingtin, cytoplasmic toxicity, and selective striatal neurodegeneration.	We have produced yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) transgenic mice expressing normal (YAC18) and mutant (YAC46 and YAC72) huntingtin (htt) in a developmental and tissue-specific manner identical to that observed in Huntington's disease (HD). YAC46 and YAC72 mice show early electrophysiological abnormalities, indicating cytoplasmic dysfunction prior to observed nuclear inclusions or neurodegeneration. By 12 months of age, YAC72 mice have a selective degeneration of medium spiny neurons in the lateral striatum associated with the translocation of N-terminal htt fragments to the nucleus. Neurodegeneration can be present in the absence of macro- or microaggregates, clearly showing that aggregates are not essential to initiation of neuronal death. These mice demonstrate that initial neuronal cytoplasmic toxicity is followed by cleavage of htt, nuclear translocation of htt N-terminal fragments, and selective neurodegeneration.
10434304	Evidence for both the nucleus and cytoplasm as subcellular sites of pathogenesis in Huntington's disease in cell culture and in transgenic mice expressing mutant huntingtin.	A unifying feature of the CAG expansion diseases is the formation of intracellular aggregates composed of the mutant polyglutamine-expanded protein. Despite the presence of aggregates in affected patients, the precise relationship between aggregates and disease pathogenesis is unresolved. Results from in vivo and in vitro studies of mutant huntingtin have led to the hypothesis that nuclear localization of aggregates is critical for the pathology of Huntington's disease (HD). We tested this hypothesis using a 293T cell culture model system by comparing the frequency and toxicity of cytoplasmic and nuclear huntingtin aggregates. Insertion of nuclear import or export sequences into huntingtin fragments containing 548 or 151 amino acids was used to reverse the normal localization of these proteins. Changing the subcellular localization of the fragments did not influence their total aggregate frequency. There were also no significant differences in toxicity associated with the presence of nuclear compared with cytoplasmic aggregates. These studies, together with findings in transgenic mice, suggest two phases for the pathogenesis of HD, with the initial toxicity in the cytoplasm followed by proteolytic processing of huntingtin, nuclear translocation with increased nuclear concentration of N-terminal fragments, seeding of aggregates and resultant apoptotic death. These findings support the nucleus and cytosol as subcellular sites for pathogenesis in HD.
11432963	Wild type Huntingtin reduces the cellular toxicity of mutant Huntingtin in mammalian cell models of Huntington's disease.	OBJECTIVES: Recent data suggest that wild type huntingtin can protect against apoptosis in the testis of mice expressing full length huntingtin transgenes with expanded CAG repeats. It is not clear if this protective effect was confined to particular cell types, or if wild type huntingtin exerted its protective effect in this model by simply reducing the formation of toxic proteolytic fragments from mutant huntingtin. METHODS: We cotransfected neuronal (SK-N-SH, human neuroblastoma) and non-neuronal (COS-7, monkey kidney) cell lines with HD exon 1 (containing either 21 or 72 CAG repeats) construct DNA and either full length wild type huntingtin or pFLAG (control vector). RESULTS: Full length wild type huntingtin significantly reduced cell death resulting from the mutant HD exon 1 fragments containing 72 CAG repeats in both cell lines. Wild type huntingtin did not significantly modulate cell death caused by transfection of HD exon 1 fragments containing 21 CAG repeats in either cell line. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that wild type huntingtin can significantly reduce the cellular toxicity of mutant HD exon 1 fragments in both neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines. This suggests that wild type huntingtin can be protective in different cell types and that it can act against the toxicity caused by a mutant huntingtin fragment as well as against a full length transgene.
12089530	Early mitochondrial calcium defects in Huntington's disease are a direct effect of polyglutamines.	Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expansion of exonic CAG triplet repeats in the gene encoding huntingtin protein (Htt), but the mechanisms by which this mutant protein causes neurodegeneration remain unknown. Here we show that lymphoblast mitochondria from patients with HD have a lower membrane potential and depolarize at lower calcium loads than do mitochondria from controls. We found a similar defect in brain mitochondria from transgenic mice expressing full-length mutant huntingtin, and this defect preceded the onset of pathological or behavioral abnormalities by months. By electron microscopy, we identified N-terminal mutant huntingtin on neuronal mitochondrial membranes, and by incubating normal mitochondria with a fusion protein containing an abnormally long polyglutamine repeat, we reproduced the mitochondrial calcium defect seen in human patients and transgenic animals. Thus, mitochondrial calcium abnormalities occur early in HD pathogenesis and may be a direct effect of mutant huntingtin on the organelle.
8253110	Reduced levels of 5-HT3 receptor recognition sites in the putamen of patients with Huntington's disease.	The present study assessed 5-HT3 receptor recognition site levels in homogenates of putamen derived from patients with clinically and neurochemically diagnosed Huntington's disease or Parkinson's disease and those from age-, sex- and post-mortem delay-matched neurologically and psychiatrically normal patients to investigate the cellular location of 5-HT3 receptors in the human putamen. Specific [3H]granisetron (0.91 nM) binding (defined by ondansetron, 10 microM) was significantly reduced in putamen homogenates from eight out of ten patients with Huntington's disease compared to similar homogenates from 'control' patients (72 +/- 6 and 39 +/- 8 fmol/g wet weight, mean +/- S.E.M., n = 10 and 8, tissue from 'control' and Huntington's disease patients, respectively, P = 0.004). In contrast, specific [3H]granisetron (1.04 nM) binding levels were similar in putamen homogenates from patients with Parkinson's disease when compared to homogenates from 'control' patients. The present results indicate that at least a proportion of the 5-HT3 receptor population in the human putamen is located on neurones that have their cell bodies within this brain region and that these receptors are not primarily located on dopamine neurone terminals in the human putamen.
10037472	Life without huntingtin: normal differentiation into functional neurons.	Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with polyglutamine expansion in a recently identified protein, huntingtin. Huntingtin is widely expressed and plays a crucial role in development, because gene-targeted HD-/- mouse embryos die early in embryogenesis. To analyze the function of normal huntingtin, we have generated HD-/- embryonic stem (ES) cells and used an in vitro model of ES cell differentiation to analyze their ability to develop into neuronal cells. Expression analysis of wild-type ES cells revealed that huntingtin is expressed at all stages during ES cell differentiation with high expression in neurons. Expression levels increased with the maturation of differentiating neurons, demonstrating that expression of huntingtin is developmentally regulated in cell culture and resembles the pattern of expression observed in differentiating neurons in the mouse brain. It is interesting that HD-/- ES cells could differentiate into mature postmitotic neurons that expressed functional voltage- and neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. Moreover, both excitatory and inhibitory spontaneous postsynaptic currents were observed, indicating the establishment of functional synapses in the absence of huntingtin. These results demonstrate that huntingtin is not required for the generation of functional neurons with features characteristic of postmitotic neurons in the developing mouse brain.
10441347	A putative Drosophila homolog of the Huntington's disease gene.	The Huntington's disease (HD) gene encodes a protein, huntingtin, with no known function and no detectable sequence similarity to other proteins in current databases. To gain insight into the normal biological role of huntingtin, we isolated and sequenced a cDNA encoding a protein that is a likely homolog of the HD gene product in Drosophila melanogaster. We also determined the complete sequence of 43 125 contiguous base pairs of genomic DNA that encompass the Drosophila HD gene, allowing the intron-exon structure and 5'- and 3'-flanking regions to be delineated. The predicted Drosophila huntingtin protein has 3583 amino acids, which is several hundred amino acids larger than any other previously characterized member of the HD family. Analysis of the genomic and cDNA sequences indicates that Drosophila HD has 29 exons, compared with the 67 exons present in vertebrate HD genes, and that Drosophila huntingtin lacks the polyglutamine and polyproline stretches present in its mammalian counterparts. The Drosophila HD mRNA is expressed in a broad range of developmental stages and in the adult, a temporal pattern of expression similar to that observed for mammalian HD transcripts. We can discern five regions of high similarity from multiple sequence alignments between Drosophila and vertebrate huntingtins. These regions may define functionally important domains within the protein.
12418139	[Current perspectives in the treatment of Huntington's chorea].	Huntington's chorea (HD) is a degenerative condition of the central nervous system of genetic origin, inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. The mechanism of the genetic defect is already known, it is a dynamic mutation in the ITI5 gene situated on chromosome 4 p 16.3 coding the protein huntington. The disease is progressive and leading to lethal outcome and effective treatment is unknown. Methods of treatment of various disturbances developing in this disease are described with stress laid on neuroprotective methods which could perhaps give better results in not so far future.
8696339	Cleavage of huntingtin by apopain, a proapoptotic cysteine protease, is modulated by the polyglutamine tract.	Apoptosis has recently been recognized as a mode of cell death in Huntington disease (HD). Apopain, a human counterpart of the nematode cysteine protease death-gene product, CED-3, has a key role in proteolytic events leading to apoptosis. Here we show that apoptotic extracts and apopain itself specifically cleave the HD gene product, huntingtin. The rate of cleavage increases with the length of the huntingtin polyglutamine tract, providing an explanation for the gain-of-function associated with CAG expansion. Our results show that huntingtin is cleaved by cysteine proteases and suggest that HD might be a disorder of inappropriate apoptosis.
11013077	Identification and characterization of the miniature pig Huntington's disease gene homolog: evidence for conservation and polymorphism in the CAG triplet repeat.	Huntington's disease (HD) is associated with a significant expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat, which results in a lengthened polyglutamine tract in the single gene product, huntingtin, on human 4p16.3. We isolated cDNA clones that encompassed the entire coding sequence of the miniature pig HD gene (Sus HD) from two porcine testis cDNA libraries. The cDNA contig revealed a 12,749-nucleotide transcript coding for a 345-kDa protein (3139 amino acid residues), which exhibited 96% peptide sequence homology to human huntingtin. Northern blot analysis revealed that the Sus HD gene was ubiquitously expressed as two large transcripts of approximately 11 and 13 kb in size in all the tested tissues, much like the human HD gene. The CAG trinucleotide repeat was found to be interrupted by CAA triplets and to encode 17 or 18 consecutive glutamine residues. In our laboratory stock of miniature pig, three allotypes in the triplet repeat sequence were found. Thus, the Sus HD gene closely resembles its human counterpart in terms of sequence and expression pattern. In particular, human-miniature pig similarities in the normal length of the CAG triplet repeat as well as its repeat-number polymorphism may indicate that miniature pig would provide a good animal model for Huntington's disease.
11285271	Tissue transglutaminase does not contribute to the formation of mutant huntingtin aggregates.	The cause of Huntington's disease (HD) is a pathological expansion of the polyglutamine domain within the NH(2)-terminal region of huntingtin. Neuronal intranuclear inclusions and cytoplasmic aggregates composed of the mutant huntingtin within certain neuronal populations are a characteristic hallmark of HD. Because in vitro expanded polyglutamine repeats are glutaminyl-donor substrates of tissue transglutaminase (tTG), it has been hypothesized that tTG may contribute to the formation of these aggregates in HD. Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to establish whether tTG plays a significant role in the formation of mutant huntingtin aggregates in the cell. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were stably transfected with truncated NH(2)-terminal huntingtin constructs containing 18 (wild type) or 82 (mutant) glutamines. In the cells expressing the mutant truncated huntingtin construct, numerous SDS-resistant aggregates were present in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Even though numerous aggregates were present in the mutant huntingtin-expressing cells, tTG did not coprecipitate with mutant truncated huntingtin. Further, tTG was totally excluded from the aggregates, and significantly increasing tTG expression had no effect on the number of aggregates or their intracellular localization (cytoplasm or nucleus). When a YFP-tagged mutant truncated huntingtin construct was transiently transfected into cells that express no detectable tTG due to stable transfection with a tTG antisense construct, there was extensive aggregate formation. These findings clearly demonstrate that tTG is not required for aggregate formation, and does not facilitate the process of aggregate formation. Therefore, in HD, as well as in other polyglutamine diseases, tTG is unlikely to play a role in the formation of aggregates.
12357329	Preimplantation genetic diagnosis for Huntington's disease with exclusion testing.	Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant, late-onset disorder, for which the gene and the causative mutation have been known since 1993. Some at-risk patients choose for presymptomatic testing and can make reproductive choices accordingly. Others however, prefer not to know their carrier status, but may still wish to prevent the birth of a carrier child. For these patients, exclusion testing after prenatal sampling has been an option for many years. A disadvantage of this test is that unaffected pregnancies may be terminated if the parent at risk (50%) has not inherited the grandparental Huntington gene, leading to serious moral and ethical objections. As an alternative, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) on embryos obtained in vitro may be proposed, after which only embryos free of risk are replaced. Embryos can then be selected, either by the amplification of the CAG repeat in the embryos without communicating results to the patients (ie non-disclosure testing), which brings its own practical and moral problems, or exclusion testing. We describe here the first PGD cycles for exclusion testing for Huntington's disease in five couples. Three couples have had at least one PGD cycle so far. One pregnancy ensued and a healthy female baby was delivered.
14657499	Yeast genes that enhance the toxicity of a mutant huntingtin fragment or alpha-synuclein.	Genome-wide screens were performed in yeast to identify genes that enhance the toxicity of a mutant huntingtin fragment or of alpha-synuclein. Of 4850 haploid mutants containing deletions of nonessential genes, 52 were identified that were sensitive to a mutant huntingtin fragment, 86 that were sensitive to alpha-synuclein, and only one mutant that was sensitive to both. Genes that enhanced toxicity of the mutant huntingtin fragment clustered in the functionally related cellular processes of response to stress, protein folding, and ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism, whereas genes that modified alpha-synuclein toxicity clustered in the processes of lipid metabolism and vesicle-mediated transport. Genes with human orthologs were overrepresented in our screens, suggesting that we may have discovered conserved and nonoverlapping sets of cell-autonomous genes and pathways that are relevant to Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease.
9527890	Huntingtin protein colocalizes with lesions of neurodegenerative diseases: An investigation in Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and Pick's diseases.	Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease associated with a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in a large gene on chromosome 4. The gene encodes the protein huntingtin with a polyglutamine tract encoded by the CAG repeat at the N-terminus. The number of CAG repeats in HD are significantly increased (36 to 120+) compared with the normal population (8-39). The pathological mechanism associated with the expanded CAG repeat in HD is not clear but there is evidence that polyglutamine is directly neurotoxic. We have immunolocalized huntingtin with an in-house, well-characterised, polyclonal antibody in HD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Picks disease (PiD) brains. Control brain tissue sections were from head injured and cerebral ischaemia cases. In HD, huntingtin was immunopositive in the surviving but damaged neurons and reactive astrocytes of the caudate and putamen. However, in AD and PiD the immunostaining was largely restricted to the characteristic intracellular inclusion bodies associated with the disease process in each case. In AD, huntingtin was localized only in the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and dystrophic neurites within the neuritic amyloid plaques but not with the amyloid. In PiD, strongly positive huntingtin immunostaining was present within cytoplasmic Pick bodies. Our findings suggest huntingtin selectively accumulates in association with abnormal intracytoplasmic and cytoskeletal filaments of neurons and glia in neurodegenerative diseases such as HD, AD, and PiD. Cells in the CNS appear sensitive to damage by the aggregated, toxic levels of huntingtin and evidence of its interaction with neurofilaments could provide information about its potential role in the aetiology of HD.
11442349	Tissue transglutaminase selectively modifies proteins associated with truncated mutant huntingtin in intact cells.	The cause of Huntington's disease (HD) is a pathological expansion of the polyglutamine domain within the N-terminal region of huntingtin. Neuronal intranuclear inclusions and cytoplasmic aggregates composed of the mutant huntingtin within certain neuronal populations are a characteristic hallmark of HD. However, how the expanded polyglutamine repeats of mutant huntingtin cause HD is not known. Because in vitro expanded polyglutamine repeats are excellent glutaminyl-donor substrates of tissue transglutaminase (tTG), it has been hypothesized that tTG may contribute to the formation of these aggregates in HD. However, an association between huntingtin and tTG or modification of huntingtin by tTG has not been demonstrated in cells. To examine the interactions between tTG and huntingtin human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were stably transfected with full-length huntingtin containing 23 (FL-Q23) (wild type) or 82 (FL-Q82) (mutant) glutamine repeats or a truncated N-terminal huntingtin construct containing 23 (Q23) (wild type) or 62 (Q62) (mutant) glutamine repeats. Aggregates were rarely observed in the cells expressing full-length mutant huntingtin, and no specific colocalization of full-length huntingtin and tTG was observed. In contrast, in cells expressing truncated mutant huntingtin (Q62) there were numerous complexes of truncated mutant huntingtin and many of these complexes co-localized with tTG. However, the complexes were not insoluble structures. Further, truncated huntingtin coimmunoprecipitated with tTG, and this association increased when tTG was activated. Activation of tTG did not result in the modification of either truncated or full-length huntingtin, however proteins that were associated with truncated mutant huntingtin were selectively modified by tTG. This study is the first to demonstrate that tTG specifically interacts with a truncated form of huntingtin, and that activated tTG selectively modifies mutant huntingtin-associated proteins. These data suggest that proteolysis of full-length mutant huntingtin likely precedes its interaction with tTG and this process may facilitate the modification of huntingtin-associated proteins and thus contribute to the etiology of HD.
14584235	Huntington's disease of early onset or juvenile Huntington's disease.	The presentation of juvenile Huntington's disease can cause diagnostic difficulties. The genetics and pathogenesis of the condition are discussed. The diagnosis will depend on the symptoms raising suspicions and the exclusion of other disorders, especially by genetic studies.
8045729	Serum iron, total iron binding capacity and ferritin in early Huntington disease patients.	Serum iron, total iron binding capacity and ferritin was estimated in 42 patients with early Huntington disease (HD) and in 148 matched controls. Ferritin levels were significantly low in affected male subjects as compared to controls. Iron levels and total iron binding capacity were normal in HD patients. The importance of this finding, that occurs early in the pathogenesis of HD, is unknown.
10411943	Transgenic mice expressing a Huntington's disease mutation are resistant to quinolinic acid-induced striatal excitotoxicity.	Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder presenting with chorea, dementia, and extensive striatal neuronal death. The mechanism through which the widely expressed mutant HD gene mediates a slowly progressing striatal neurotoxicity is unknown. Glutamate receptor-mediated excitotoxicity has been hypothesized to contribute to the pathogenesis of HD. Here we show that transgenic HD mice expressing exon 1 of a human HD gene with an expanded number of CAG repeats (line R6/1) are strongly protected from acute striatal excitotoxic lesions. Intrastriatal infusions of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist quinolinic acid caused massive striatal neuronal death in wild-type mice, but no damage in transgenic HD littermates. The remarkable neuroprotection in transgenic HD mice occurred at a stage when they had not developed any neurological symptoms caused by the mutant HD gene. At this stage there was no change in the number of striatal neurons and astrocytes in untreated R6/1 mice, although the striatal volume was decreased by 17%. Moreover, transgenic HD mice had normal striatal levels of NMDA receptors, calbindin D28k (calcium buffer), superoxide dismutase activity (antioxidant enzyme), Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic protein), heat shock protein 70 (stress-induced anti-apoptotic protein), and citrate synthase activity (mitochondrial enzyme). We propose that the presence of exon 1 of the mutant HD gene induces profound changes in striatal neurons that render these cells resistant to excessive NMDA receptor activation.
10859666	Does mRNA translation starting from an alternative initiation site contribute to the pathology of Huntington's disease?	Huntington's disease is associated with an expanded and unstable trinucleotide repeat (CAG)(n). Various possibilities have been suggested to explain the significance of poly-(CAG) length in HD, including changes in the structure of the product (huntingtin) which result in the protein acquiring deleterious properties. We have looked at the nucleotide sequence coding for huntingtin and find that another possibility may exist for the correlation between the occurrence of HD and poly-CAG length. We have noted an alternative reading frame that includes the trinucleotide repeat, now read as (GCA)(n). Upon close examination of this alternative gene product, we observe features that suggest it can likewise have deleterious properties.
12223539	Caspase cleavage of mutant huntingtin precedes neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease.	Huntington's disease (HD) results from polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin (htt), a protein with several consensus caspase cleavage sites. Despite the identification of htt fragments in the brain, it has not been shown conclusively that htt is cleaved by caspases in vivo. Furthermore, no study has addressed when htt cleavage occurs with respect to the onset of neurodegeneration. Using antibodies that detect only caspase-cleaved htt, we demonstrate that htt is cleaved in vivo specifically at the caspase consensus site at amino acid 552. We detect caspase-cleaved htt in control human brain as well as in HD brains with early grade neuropathology, including one homozygote. Cleaved htt is also seen in wild-type and HD transgenic mouse brains before the onset of neurodegeneration. These results suggest that caspase cleavage of htt may be a normal physiological event. However, in HD, cleavage of mutant htt would release N-terminal fragments with the potential for increased toxicity and accumulation caused by the presence of the expanded polyglutamine tract. Furthermore, htt fragments were detected most abundantly in cortical projection neurons, suggesting that accumulation of expanded htt fragments in these neurons may lead to corticostriatal dysfunction as an early event in the pathogenesis of HD.
12392775	Neuroprotective and neurorestorative signal transduction mechanisms in brain aging: modification by genes, diet and behavior.	Cells in the brain deploy multiple mechanisms to maintain the integrity of nerve cell circuits, and to facilitate responses to environmental demands and promote recovery of function after injury. The mechanisms include production of neurotrophic factors and cytokines, expression of various cell survival-promoting proteins (e.g. protein chaperones, antioxidant enzymes, Bcl-2 and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins), protection of the genome by telomerase and DNA repair proteins, and mobilization of neural stem cells to replace damaged neurons and glia. The aging process challenges such neuroprotective and neurorestorative mechanisms, often with devastating consequences as in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases and stroke. Genetic and environmental factors superimposed upon the aging process can determine whether brain aging is successful or unsuccessful. Mutations in genes that cause inherited forms of AD (amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins), Parkinson's disease (alpha-synuclein and parkin) and trinucleotide repeat disorders (e.g. huntingtin and the androgen receptor) overwhelm endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms. On the other hand, neuroprotective mechanisms can be bolstered by dietary (caloric restriction, and folate and antioxidant supplementation) and behavioral (cognitive and physical activities) modifications. At the cellular and molecular levels, successful brain aging can be facilitated by activating a hormesis response to which neurons respond by upregulating the expression of neurotrophic factors and stress proteins. Neural stem cells that reside in the adult brain are also responsive to environmental demands, and appear capable of replacing lost or dysfunctional neurons and glial cells, perhaps even in the aging brain. The recent application of modem methods of molecular and cellular biology to the problem of brain aging is revealing a remarkable capacity within brain cells for adaptation to aging and resistance to disease.
12824708	DNA testing for Huntington disease in the Turkish population.	Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease, characterized by involuntary movements, behavioral and personality changes and dementia. Although the mean age at onset is about 40 years, onset varies from 5 to 79 years. Therefore, at-risk individuals are never sure to have escaped the disease. The genetic defect is a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion at the 5' end of the IT-15 gene on chromosome 4. In this study, we analyzed 127 patients with HD and 122 healthy controls. The numbers of CAG repeats varied from 38 to 78 (median: 42) in 127 HD patients, while in healthy controls we observed only 10-35 CAG repeats (median: 18). The length of the CAG repeat expansion in Turkish HD patients and normal controls was similar to that reported from other populations. Negative correlations (r = -0.67) were also found between age of disease onset and repeat length.
12873857	A randomized trial of amantadine in Huntington disease.	CONTEXT: Huntington chorea, like levodopa-induced dyskinesias, may be responsive to amantadine hydrochloride treatment. OBJECTIVES: To measure the effect of amantadine treatment on Huntington chorea and to test a hypothesis that the adventitious movements are associated with reduced central proprioception that can be corrected by amantadine treatment. DESIGN: A randomized placebo-controlled cross-over trial with 2 weeks of treatment. SETTING: A tertiary referral center. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four subjects with Huntington disease took amantadine hydrochloride, 100 mg 3 times daily for 2 weeks, and placebo for 2 weeks. METHODS: Chorea of the face, trunk, and limbs while seated was videotaped at baseline and after each study phase. Segments were viewed in random order by blinded reviewers and scored. Proprioception was determined using arm restraints in which the right and left elbows were set at slightly different angles, and the errors in selecting the more extended elbow over 40 trials were recorded. RESULTS: The chorea score was not correlated with a proprioception deficit. Neither chorea nor proprioception were significantly affected by amantadine therapy. The chorea score was 9.6 (3.1) points at baseline and 9.7 (3.7) points when the patient was receiving amantadine therapy. The 95% confidence interval for the difference between placebo effect and amantadine effect was -1.43 to 1.0 points. Despite this, 19 subjects felt improved during the amantadine phase compared with 6 subjects improved in the placebo phase (P =.006) and the quality of life was better (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Elbow proprioception was not shown to be related to Huntington chorea. Amantadine hydrochloride treatment at doses of 300 mg/d had no effect, on average, for Huntington chorea, although most patients felt subjectively better during the short course of amantadine treatment.
9198788	[Coincidence of Huntington chorea and epilepsy].	We report on a patient suffering from epilepsy and severe personality changes. Huntington disease was diagnosed by molecular-biological investigation. Clinical characteristics are discussed on the basis of modern concepts of the genetic mechanism. Neuroradiological investigation revealed marked cerebellar atrophy, while typical findings of Huntington disease, such as caudate nucleus volume loss, were lacking. The cerebellar atrophy could be attributable either to long-term phenytoin-medication or to the pathological process itself.
9253530	ECT for the treatment of Huntington's disease: a case study.	We report a 56-year-old man with Huntington's disease whose chorea substantially improved after treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT should be considered for medically refractory cases of movement disorders, especially those with severe disability.
9401013	The repeat expansion detection method in the analysis of diseases with CAG/CTG repeat expansion: usefulness and limitations.	The repeat expansion detection (RED) method was described to detect expansions of trinucleotide repeats of unknown chromosomal location. We have improved the RED method by the use of 8-mer oligonucleotides and assessed its usefulness in 30 samples from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), Huntington's disease (HD), and Machado Joseph's disease (MJD), for which the number of CAG/CTG repeats was determined by sequencing. There was a good correlation between the number of repeats detected by sequencing and those identified by RED. However, in 17% of samples, the RED gave additional fragments for ligation products of different size than the CAG/CTG repeat expansion detected in the sample by sequencing. The same was observed in a group of control subjects (n = 78) without known clinical abnormalities in which products of more than 40 repeats were detected in 27% of them, indicating that CAG/CTG repeat expansions are common in the general population. Wether this corresponds to unidentified loci with expansions deserves further investigation.
11761473	McLeod neuroacanthocytosis: genotype and phenotype.	McLeod syndrome is caused by mutations of XK, an X-chromosomal gene of unknown function. Originally defined as a peculiar Kell blood group variant, the disease affects multiple organs, including the nervous system, but is certainly underdiagnosed. We analyzed the mutations and clinical findings of 22 affected men, aged 27 to 72 years. Fifteen different XK mutations were found, nine of which were novel, including the one of the eponymous case McLeod. Their common result is predicted absence or truncation of the XK protein. All patients showed elevated levels of muscle creatine phosphokinase, but clinical myopathy was less common. A peripheral neuropathy with areflexia was found in all but 2 patients. The central nervous system was affected in 15 patients, as obvious from the occurrence of seizures, cognitive impairment, psychopathology, and choreatic movements. Neuroimaging emphasized the particular involvement of the basal ganglia, which was also detected in 1 asymptomatic young patient. Most features develop with age, mainly after the fourth decade. The resemblance of McLeod syndrome with Huntington's disease and with autosomal recessive chorea-acanthocytosis suggests that the corresponding proteins--XK, huntingtin, and chorein--might belong to a common pathway, the dysfunction of which causes degeneration of the basal ganglia.
11765125	Caspases in Huntington's disease.	Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant condition, resulting from a mutation in huntingtin (htt). Htt is a novel protein, and its normal function is at present not well understood. Nuclear translocation of mutant htt in vitro up-regulates expression of the cell death gene caspase-1. We have demonstrated in a transgenic HD mouse model that caspase-1 and caspase-3 are transcriptionally up-regulated and activated. Underscoring the relevancy of these findings, recent results suggest that caspase-1 is activated in brains of humans with HD. Caspase activation results in the proteolytic cleavage of key cellular targets, including htt, leading to cell dysfunction. Caspase activation leading to cell dysfunction and death correlates with disease progression. In HD-transgenic mice, caspase inhibition resulted in a delayed onset of symptoms, a slowed progression, and prolonged survival. Caspase inhibition is a therapeutic strategy that merits evaluation in humans with HD.
12354289	Inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase activity and decreased 5-HT1A receptor binding in a mouse model of Huntington's disease.	The pathogenic mechanisms of the mutant huntingtin protein that cause Huntington's disease (HD) are unknown. Previous studies have reported significant decreases in the levels of serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the brains of the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD. In an attempt to elucidate the cause of these neurochemical perturbations in HD, the protein levels and enzymatic activity of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), the rate-limiting enzyme in 5-HT biosynthesis, were determined. Enzyme activity was measured in brainstem homogenates from 4-, 8-, and 12-week-old R6/2 mice and compared with aged-matched wild-type control mice. We observed a 62% decrease in brainstem TPH activity (p = 0.009) in 4-week-old R6/2 mice, well before the onset of behavioral symptoms. In addition, significant decreases in TPH activity were also observed at 8 and 12 weeks of age (61%, p = 0.02 and 86%, p = 0.005, respectively). In the 12-week-old-mice, no change in immunoreactive TPH was observed. In vitro binding showed that TPH does not bind to exon 1 of huntingtin in a polyglutamine-dependent manner. Specifically, glutathione-S-transferase huntingtin exon 1 proteins with 20, 32 or 53 polyglutamines did not interact with radiolabeled tryptophan hydroxylase. Therefore, the inhibition of TPH activity does not appear to result from a direct huntingtin/TPH interaction. Receptor binding analyses for the 5-HT1A receptor in 12-week-old R6/2 mice revealed significant reductions in 8-OH-[3H]DPAT binding in several hippocampal and cortical regions. These results demonstrate that the serotonergic system in the R6/2 mice is severely disrupted in both presymptomatic and symptomatic mice. The presymptomatic inhibition of TPH activity in the R6/2 mice may help explain the functional consequences of HD and provide insights into new targets for pharmacotherapy.
9932964	Analysis of a very large trinucleotide repeat in a patient with juvenile Huntington's disease.	A patient with juvenile Huntington's disease (HD) of probable maternal inheritance is reported. The expanded IT-15 allele was only detected with the use of modified PCR and Southern transfer techniques, which showed a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion of approximately 250 repeats-the largest CAG expansion reported within the huntingtin gene. This case emphasizes the need for communication between the diagnostic laboratory and the clinician to define the molecular genetics of unusual cases.
10076024	Mitochondrial involvement in Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia and Friedreich's ataxia.	Respiratory chain dysfunction has been identified in several neurodegenerative disorders. In Friedreich's ataxia (FA) and Huntington's disease (HD), where the respective mutations are in nuclear genes encoding non-respiratory chain mitochondrial proteins, the defects in oxidative phosphorylation are clearly secondary. In Parkinson's disease (PD) the situation is less clear, with some evidence for a primary role of mitochondrial DNA in at least a proportion of patients. The pattern of the respiratory chain defect may provide some clue to its cause; in PD there appears to be a selective complex I deficiency; in HD and FA the deficiencies are most severe in complex II/III with a less severe defect in complex IV. Aconitase activity in HD and FA is severely decreased in brain and muscle, respectively, but appears to be normal in PD brain. Free radical generation is thought to be of importance in both HD and FA, via excitotoxicity in HD and abnormal iron handling in FA. The oxidative damage observed in PD may be secondary to the mitochondrial defect. Whatever the cause(s) and sequence of events, respiratory chain deficiencies appear to play an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration. The mitochondrial abnormalities induced may converge on the function of the mitochondrion in apoptosis. This mode of cell death is thought to play an important role in neurodegenerative diseases and it is tempting to speculate that the observed mitochondrial defects in PD, HD and FA result directly in apoptotic cell death, or in the lowering of a cell's threshold to undergo apoptosis. Clarifying the role of mitochondria in pathogenesis may provide opportunities for the development of treatments designed to reverse or prevent neurodegeneration.
10891614	Cannabinoid receptor messenger RNA levels decrease in a subset of neurons of the lateral striatum, cortex and hippocampus of transgenic Huntington's disease mice.	One of the earliest changes, at the molecular level, that occurs in human Huntington's disease patients is reduction in cannabinoid receptor ligand binding in the substantia nigra pars reticulata compared to neurologically normal controls. The loss of cannabinoid receptor binding is thought to occur early in or prior to the development of Huntington's disease neuropathology. We wish to determine whether cannabinoid receptor messenger RNA levels were altered in a mouse model of Huntington's disease. Transgenic mice hemizygous for the promoter sequence and exon 1 of the human Huntington's disease gene exhibit a progressive neurological phenotype with many of the features of Huntington's disease. This neurological phenotype develops in the absence of neural degeneration making these mice a model system to dissociate changes related to cell dysfunction from changes related to cell loss. We examine the steady-state levels and cellular distribution of the brain-specific cannabinoid receptor messenger RNA by northern blot and in situ hybridization. The cannabinoid receptor messenger RNA was expressed throughout the striatum, cortex and hippocampus of wild-type mice. At four and five weeks of age, there was no difference in the distribution of the cannabinoid receptor messenger RNA between the wild-type and transgenic Huntington's disease mice. At six, seven, eight and 10 weeks of age, however, the Huntington's disease mice exhibit reduced levels of cannabinoid receptor messenger RNA in the lateral striatum compared to age-matched controls. The Huntington's disease mice also showed a loss of cannabinoid receptor messenger RNA within a subset of neurons in the cortex and hippocampus. We did not observe any difference in the expression of cannabinoid receptor between the wild-type and Huntington's disease mice throughout Ammon's horn of the hippocampus or in the medial striatum. The decrease in cannabinoid receptor messenger RNA levels preceded the development of the Huntington's disease phenotype and neuronal degeneration and, therefore, these transgenic mice model early cellular changes observed in human patients. Our results demonstrate that the single copy cannabinoid receptor gene is subjected to cell-specific and time-dependent regulation of the steady-state level of its gene product as a result of the expression of the Huntington's disease gene. As the endogenous cannabinoid receptor agonist, anandimide, has been shown to modulate dopamine neurotransmission within the basal ganglia, the loss of cannabinoid receptors may contribute to the development of motor symptoms or cognitive decline or both seen in Huntington's disease patients.
12021262	Huntingtin-associated protein 1 interacts with hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate and functions in endosomal trafficking.	Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) is a novel protein of unknown function with a higher binding affinity for the mutant form of Huntington's disease protein huntingtin. Here we report that HAP1 interacts with hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs), a mammalian homologue of yeast vacuolar protein sorting protein Vps27p involved in the endosome-to-lysosome trafficking. This novel interaction was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen using full-length Hrs as bait, and confirmed by in vitro binding assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Deletion analysis reveals that the association of HAP1 with Hrs is mediated via a coiled-coil interaction between the central coiled-coil domains of both proteins. Immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation studies show that HAP1 co-localizes with Hrs on early endosomes. Like Hrs, overexpression of HAP1 causes the formation of enlarged early endosomes, and inhibits the degradation of internalized epidermal growth factor receptors. Whereas overexpression of HAP1 does not affect either constitutive or ligand-induced receptor-mediated endocytosis, it potently blocks the trafficking of endocytosed epidermal growth factor receptors from early endosomes to late endosomes. These findings implicate, for the first time, the involvement of HAP1 in the regulation of vesicular trafficking from early endosomes to the late endocytic compartments.
12077181	Calpain activation in Huntington's disease.	Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG expansion that results in elongation of the polyglutamine tract at the N terminus of huntingtin (Htt). Abnormal proteolytic processing of mutant Htt has been implicated as a critical step in the initiation of HD. The protease(s) involved in this process has not been fully characterized. Here we report that activated calpain was detected in the caudate of human HD tissue but not in age-matched controls. In addition, one of the major N-terminal Htt proteolytic fragments found in human HD tissue appears to be derived from calpain cleavage. Htt fragments in HD lysates were similar in size to those produced by exposure of in vitro-translated Htt to exogenous calpain. Incubation of in vitro-translated Htt with calpain generated a cascade of cleavage events with an initial intermediate cleavage product at 72 kDa and a final cleavage product at 47 kDa. The rate of cleavage of Htt by calpain was polyglutamine-length-dependent. These results suggest that cleavage of Htt in human HD tissue is mediated in part by the Ca2+-activated neutral protease, calpain.
12116316	Non-disclosing preimplantation genetic diagnosis for Huntington disease.	OBJECTIVES: Individuals at risk for Huntington disease face difficult decisions regarding their reproductive options. Most do not wish to pass on the gene for Huntington disease to their children, but may not be prepared themselves to undergo presymptomatic testing and learn their genetic status. For these reasons, many at-risk individuals with a family history of HD would choose a method of genetic diagnosis that would assure them that they can have children unaffected with HD without revealing their own genetic status (non-disclosing). We have shown that, with a carefully designed and executed programme of non-disclosing preimplantation genetic testing, one can successfully assist at-risk couples to have their own biological children who are free from Huntington disease, without forcing parents to confront knowledge of their own genetic status. METHODS: Couples where one partner was at 50% risk for Huntington disease underwent in vitro fertilization with preimplantation embryo biopsy and molecular analysis for Huntington disease where appropriate. RESULTS: After extensive counselling and informed consent, 10 couples underwent 13 in vitro fertilization and two frozen embryo transfer cycles in a programme for non-disclosing preimplantation genetic diagnosis for Huntington disease. In 11 cycles, embryos determined to be free of Huntington disease were transferred, resulting in five clinical pregnancies. One set of twins and three singleton pregnancies have delivered. One pregnancy resulted in a first-trimester loss. CONCLUSIONS: The option of non-disclosing preimplantation genetic diagnosis should be reviewed, along with other relevant medical options, when counselling at-risk Huntington disease families.
10932179	Amino-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin show selective accumulation in striatal neurons and synaptic toxicity.	Huntington disease (HD) is caused by expansion of a glutamine repeat in the amino-terminal region of huntingtin. Despite its widespread expression, mutant huntingtin induces selective neuronal loss in striatal neurons. Here we report that, in mutant mice expressing HD repeats, the production and aggregation of N-terminal huntingtin fragments preferentially occur in HD-affected neurons and their processes and axonal terminals. N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin form aggregates and induce neuritic degeneration in cultured striatal neurons. N-terminal mutant huntingtin also binds to synaptic vesicles and inhibits their glutamate uptake in vitro. The specific processing and accumulation of toxic fragments of N-terminal huntingtin in HD-affected striatal neurons, especially in their neuronal processes and axonal terminals, may contribute to the selective neuropathology of HD.
11092755	Huntingtin: an iron-regulated protein essential for normal nuclear and perinuclear organelles.	Huntington's disease (HD), with its selective neuronal cell loss, is caused by an elongated glutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. To discover the pathways that are candidates for the protein's normal and/or abnormal function, we surveyed 19 classes of organelle in Hdh(ex4/5)/Hdh(ex4/5) knock-out compared with wild-type embryonic stem cells to identify any that might be affected by huntingtin deficiency. Although the majority did not differ, dramatic changes in six classes revealed that huntingtin's function is essential for the normal nuclear (nucleoli, transcription factor-speckles) and perinuclear membrane (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi and recycling endosomes) organelles and for proper regulation of the iron pathway. Moreover, upmodulation by deferoxamine mesylate implicates huntingtin as an iron-response protein. However, excess huntingtin produced abnormal organelles that resemble the deficiency phenotype, suggesting the importance of huntingtin level to the protein's normal pathway. Thus, organelles that require huntingtin to function suggest roles for the protein in RNA biogenesis, trafficking and iron homeostasis to be explored in HD pathogenesis.
11358447	Early degenerative changes in transgenic mice expressing mutant huntingtin involve dendritic abnormalities but no impairment of mitochondrial energy production.	Mitochondrial defects, which occur in the brain of late-stage Huntington's disease (HD) patients, have been proposed to underlie the selective neuronal loss in the disease. To shed light on the possible role of mitochondrial energy impairment in the early phases of HD pathophysiology, we carried out Golgi impregnation and quantitative histochemical/biochemical studies in HD full-length cDNA transgenic mice that were symptomatic but had not developed to a stage in which neuronal loss could be documented. Golgi staining showed morphologic abnormalities that included a significant decrease in the number of dendritic spines and a thickening of proximal dendrites in striatal and cortical neurons. In contrast, measurements of mitochondrial electron transport Complexes I-IV did not reveal changes in the striatum and cerebral cortex in these mice. Examination of the neostriatum and cerebral cortex in human presymptomatic and pathological Grade 1 HD cases also showed no change in the activity of mitochondrial Complexes I-IV. These data suggest that dendritic alterations precede irreversible cell loss in HD, and that mitochondrial energy impairment is a consequence, rather than a cause, of early neuropathological changes.
12956709	Co-localization of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and wild-type huntingtin in normal and quinolinic acid-lesioned rat brain.	Loss of huntingtin-mediated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene transcription has been described in Huntington's disease (HD) [Zuccato et al. (2001) Science, 293, 493-498]. It has been shown that BDNF is synthesized in the pyramidal layer of cerebral cortex and released in the striatum [Altar et al. (1997) Nature, 389, 856-860; Conner et al. (1997) J. Neurosci., 17, 2295-2313]. Here we show the cellular localization of BDNF in huntingtin-containing neurons in normal rat brain; our double-label immunofluorescence study shows that huntingtin and BDNF are co-contained in approximately 99% of pyramidal neurons of motor cortex. In the striatum, huntingtin is expressed in 75% of neurons containing BDNF. In normal striatum we also show that BDNF is contained in cholinergic and in NOS-containing interneurons, which are relatively resistant to HD degeneration. Furthermore, we show a reduction in huntingtin and in BDNF immunoreactivity in cortical neurons after striatal excitotoxic lesion. Our data are confirmed by an ELISA study of BDNF and by a Western blot analysis of huntingtin in cortex of quinolic acid (QUIN)-lesioned hemispheres. In the lesioned striatum we describe that the striatal subpopulation of cholinergic neurons, surviving degeneration, contain BDNF. The finding that BDNF is contained in nearly all neurons that contain huntingtin in the normal cortex, along with the reduced expression of BDNF after QUIN injection of the striatum, shows that huntingtin may be required for BDNF production in cortex.
7620118	Huntington's disease.	Early in 1993, an unstable, expanded trinucleotide repeat in a novel gene of unknown function was identified on HD chromosomes. This discovery unleased a flurry of experimentation that has established the expanded CAG repeat the almost universal cause of the characteristic neurologic symptoms and pathology of this neurodegenerative disorder of midlife onset. The biochemical basis for the specific neuronal loss of HD remains uncertain, but the genetic lesion probably acts via its consequent polyglutamine segment in the protein product, huntingtin. This review will describe the basic parameters of the HD repeat's behavior and the knowledge that has accumulated concerning its potential mechanisms of action.
10770929	Inhibiting caspase cleavage of huntingtin reduces toxicity and aggregate formation in neuronal and nonneuronal cells.	Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG expansion that results in expansion of a polyglutamine tract at the extreme N terminus of huntingtin (htt). htt with polyglutamine expansion is proapoptotic in different cell types. Here, we show that caspase inhibitors diminish the toxicity of htt. Additionally, we define htt itself as an important caspase substrate by generating a site-directed htt mutant that is resistant to caspase-3 cleavage at positions 513 and 530 and to caspase-6 cleavage at position 586. In contrast to cleavable htt, caspase-resistant htt with an expanded polyglutamine tract has reduced toxicity in apoptotically stressed neuronal and nonneuronal cells and forms aggregates at a much reduced frequency. These results suggest that inhibiting caspase cleavage of htt may therefore be of potential therapeutic benefit in Huntington's disease.
11008591	Prevalence of Huntington disease in New South Wales in 1996.	OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of Huntington disease (HD) in New South Wales on Australian Census Day (6 August) 1996. DESIGN: Survey of records of the Huntington Disease Service and major hospitals, and of neurologists, psychiatrists, clinical geneticists and genetic counsellors. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: All patients in NSW who, on Census Day 1996, either had a definite diagnosis of HD (motor signs of chorea or ataxia and family history of HD or positive DNA test result) or would have had signs and later received a definite diagnosis (assessed 1 April 1997 to 1 July 1999). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence (HD patients per 100,000 population); patient characteristics; year and basis of diagnosis. RESULTS: 380 patients with definite HD were identified, giving a prevalence of HD in NSW in 1996 of 6.29 per 100,000 population (95% CI, 5.68-6.96). A third of HD patients were aged 60 years or older. Diagnosis was confirmed by DNA testing for 171 patients (45%), including 30 (8%) with no recorded family history. Average numbers of new diagnoses per year were 11.8 (1984-1988), 21.8 (1989-1993) and 28.6 (1994-1998). Estimated number of people with a 50% risk of inheriting the HD mutation was 25.2 per 100,000 population. Estimated incidence of HD in 1996 was 0.65 per 100,000 population. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of HD in NSW is similar to estimated prevalence in other Australian and Western populations. Increasing numbers of cases are being diagnosed, and the 18 chronic care beds currently designated for HD patients in NSW are unlikely to be sufficient.
10434298	Are there multiple pathways in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease?	Studies of huntingtin localization in human post-mortem brain offer insights and a framework for basic experiments in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease. In neurons of cortex and striatum, we identified changes in the cytoplasmic localization of huntingtin including a marked perinuclear accumulation of huntingtin and formation of multivesicular bodies, changes conceivably pointing to an altered handling of huntingtin in neurons. In Huntington's disease, huntingtin also accumulates in aberrant subcellular compartments such as nuclear and neuritic aggregates co-localized with ubiquitin. The site of protein aggregation is polyglutamine-dependent, both in juvenile-onset patients having more aggregates in the nucleus and in adult-onset patients presenting more neuritic aggregates. Studies in vitro reveal that the genesis of these aggregates and cell death are tied to cleavage of mutant huntingtin. However, we found that the aggregation of mutant huntingtin can be dissociated from the extent of cell death. Thus properties of mutant huntingtin more subtle than its aggregation, such as its proteolysis and protein interactions that affect vesicle trafficking and nuclear transport, might suffice to cause neurodegeneration in the striatum and cortex. We propose that mutant huntingtin engages multiple pathogenic pathways leading to neuronal death.
12169117	Nuclear localization of N-terminal mutant huntingtin is cell cycle dependent.	Unlike normal huntingtin (htt) which is located predominantly in the cytoplasm, mutant htt is also found in the nucleus of affected neurons. Nuclear localization of toxic polyglutamine-containing proteins has been postulated to be necessary for the pathogenesis of triplet repeat disorders. However, little is known about the mechanism by which mutant htt enters the nucleus. We have recently reported exclusive nuclear localization of exon 1 mutant htt in striatal primary neuronal cultures from the HD94 conditional mouse model of HD. This seemed to contradict the predominant cytoplasmic localization of N-terminal htt reported from transfection experiments and prompted us to hypothesize that subcellular localization of the toxic htt fragment might be favoured in nondividing cells. To test this, we analyzed subcellular localization of mutant htt in HD94 mixed neuron-glia cultures. Subconfluent glial cells showed cytoplasmic localization. However, nuclear localization was prompted by confluence, by serum withdrawal, and by treatment with cell cycle progression inhibitors such as Ara C or lactacystin. BrdU labelling experiments further confirmed that nuclear localization does not occur in dividing cells. Our findings offer an explanation for the neuronal specific toxicity of mutant htt despite its ubiquitous expression. Unraveling the mechanism of this cell cycle arrest-dependent entrance into the nucleus may offer new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.
12235581	[Molecular basis of Huntington's disease and possible pathogenic mechanisms].	INTRODUCTION: Huntington s disease is one of the, at least, nine neurological disorders caused by a CAG triplet expansion coding for a poly glutamine sequence in the corresponding protein. Huntington s disease affects 3 7 in 100.000 individuals in Western Europe descendent population and the symptomatology comprises motor (including chorea and rigidity), cognitive (subcortical dementia), and psychological (including irritability and depression) manifestations until death. DEVELOPMENT: Neuropathology is extremely restricted, with atrophy occurring in the striatum and, to a lesser extent, in the cerebral cortex. Microscopically, the neuropathology is characterized by neuronal loss, reactive gliosis, and intraneuronal protein aggregates. Since the initial description of this disease by George Huntington in 1872, substantial advance has been achieved in the understanding of this pathology. The pathogenic gene and mutation were identified in 1993. This allowed the generation of multiple in vitro, cellular, and animal models of Huntington s disease. These studies have originated multiple hypotheses regarding the mechanism by which huntingtin with an expanded poly glutamine tract exerts its toxicity. CONCLUSION: We try to summarize the current knowledge about this disease from the clinical manifestations to the molecular basis, in an attempt to offer a global view of this pathology.
12270644	The bacterial chaperonin GroEL requires GroES to reduce aggregation and cell death in a COS-7 cell model of Huntington's disease.	Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by expansions of more than 35 CAG repeats in the HD gene. These repeats are translated into a long polyglutamine tract that confers a deleterious gain-of-function on the mutant protein. Intraneuronal inclusions comprising mutant huntingtin are found in HD patient brains. Here we show that the bacterial chaperonin GroEL can reduce aggregation of mutant huntingtin in COS-7 cells and requires GroES for efficient activity, analogous to what has been described in bacteria. The reduction in aggregation of mutant huntingtin by GroEL/GroES was associated with protection against polyglutamine-induced cell death.
8647411	[Analysis of trinucleotide repeat expansion as a new mechanism of mutation in Huntington's chorea: theoretical and applied aspects].	The Huntington's chorea mutation consists of expansion of trinucleotide CAG repeats in the recently discovered gene IT-15. In this work, for the first time in a population of Russian patients, correlations between the number of copies of CAG repeats and various clinical characteristics of the disease are investigated. It is established that the degree of triplet expansion determines the age of onset of the disease and the rate of progression of the neurological and mental symptoms of Huntington's chorea, and it is also shown that the genetic instability of the mutant allele is considerably higher upon transmission of the disease gene along the paternal line. We obtained direct confirmation of the possibility of genetic instability of a normal allele inherited paternally. In this work, the first successful direct (including preclinical) DNA diagnosis in Russia of Huntington's chorea was obtained.
8867730	Expanded glutamines and neurodegeneration--a gain of insight.	Glutamine repeat expansion has been established as the mutation underlying five inherited neurodegenerative diseases. The mechanism by which this apparently universal mutation, in ubiquitously expressed proteins, causes highly selective neurodegeneration is unknown. The proteins containing the glutamine expansions are otherwise unrelated and likely to have different functions. Two recently published papers provide evidence of a conformational change occurring in polyglutamine expansions, which may allow novel interactions and is consistent with a toxic gain-of-function hypothesis. HAP1, a protein that interacts with huntingtin (Huntington's disease protein), has an expression profile that intriguingly mirrors the selective neurodegeneration seen in Huntington's disease.
11709539	The HD mutation causes progressive lethal neurological disease in mice expressing reduced levels of huntingtin.	Huntingtin is an essential protein that with mutant polyglutamine tracts initiates dominant striatal neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease (HD). To assess the consequences of mutant protein when huntingtin is limiting, we have studied three lines of compound heterozygous mice in which both copies of the HD gene homolog (Hdh) were altered, resulting in greatly reduced levels of huntingtin with a normal human polyglutamine length (Q20) and/or an expanded disease-associated segment (Q111): Hdh(neoQ20)/Hdh(neoQ20), Hdh(neoQ20)/Hdh(null) and Hdh(neoQ20)/Hdh(neoQ111). All surviving mice in each of the three lines were small from birth, and had variable movement abnormalities. Magnetic resonance micro-imaging and histological evaluation showed enlarged ventricles in approximately 50% of the Hdh(neoQ20)/Hdh(neoQ111) and Hdh(neoQ20)/Hdh(null) mice, revealing a developmental defect that does not worsen with age. Only Hdh(neoQ20)/Hdh(neoQ111) mice exhibited a rapidly progressive movement disorder that, in the absence of striatal pathology, begins with hind-limb clasping during tail suspension and tail stiffness during walking by 3-4 months of age, and then progresses to paralysis of the limbs and tail, hypokinesis and premature death, usually by 12 months of age. Thus, dramatically reduced huntingtin levels fail to support normal development in mice, resulting in reduced body size, movement abnormalities and a variable increase in ventricle volume. On this sensitized background, mutant huntingtin causes a rapid neurological disease, distinct from the HD-pathogenic process. These results raise the possibility that therapeutic elimination of huntingtin in HD patients could lead to unintended neurological, as well as developmental side-effects.
12378057	Genetics of movement disorders: an abbreviated overview.	Linkage of the Huntington's disease gene to chromosome 4 in 1983 marked the birth of modern genetics in movement disorders. The discovery that an expanded trinucleotide DNA repeat was central to the mechanism of this disease has been repeated over and over in a growing list of inherited ataxias. In 1997, a different mutation and genetic mechanism was discovered in a severe type of generalized primary torsion dystonia - Oppenheim's dystonia. Before this, only the genetic cause for rare metabolic dystonias was known, notably dopa-responsive (Segawa's) dystonia. In the same year, from the identification of mutation in the alpha-synuclein gene in rare pedigrees with autosomal dominant parkinsonism, arose the concept that Parkinson's disease may be part of a broader group of 'synucleinopathies', in which there is a fundamental defect in protein processing. In the following year, mutations in autosomal recessive juvenile onset parkinsonism were found in a gene called 'parkin'. Parkin mutations are a more common cause of parkinsonism than the rare alpha-synuclein mutations, particularly in young-onset disease. However, a most important understanding, occurring in the last year, has been the relationship between the parkin gene product, alpha-synuclein and abnormal protein degradation in the cell. A unified theory of neuronal death in Parkinson's disease is emerging, pointing to potential new therapies in the future.
10864968	Abnormal synaptic plasticity and impaired spatial cognition in mice transgenic for exon 1 of the human Huntington's disease mutation.	Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant progressive and fatal neurodegenerative brain disorder caused by an expanded CAG/polyglutamine repeat in the coding region of the gene. Presymptomatic Huntington's disease patients often exhibit cognitive deficits before the onset of classical symptoms. To investigate the possibility that changes in synaptic plasticity might underlie cognitive impairment in HD, we examined hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial cognition in a transgenic mouse (R6/2 line) expressing exon 1 of the human Huntington's disease gene containing an expanded CAG repeat. This mouse exhibits a progressive and fatal neurological phenotype that resembles Huntington's disease. We report that R6/2 mice show marked alterations in synaptic plasticity at both CA1 and dentate granule cell synapses, and impaired spatial cognitive performance in the Morris water maze. The changes in hippocampal plasticity were age dependent, appearing at CA1 synapses several weeks before they were observed in the dentate gyrus. Deficits in synaptic plasticity at CA1 synapses occurred before an overt phenotype. This suggests that altered synaptic plasticity contributes to the pre-symptomatic changes in cognition reported in human carriers of the Huntington' disease gene. The temporal and regional changes in synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus mirror the appearance of neuronal intranuclear inclusions, suggesting a relationship between polyglutamine aggregation and dysfunction.
10888929	Minocycline inhibits caspase-1 and caspase-3 expression and delays mortality in a transgenic mouse model of Huntington disease.	Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatment. Minocycline is a tetracycline derivative with proven safety. After ischemia, minocycline inhibits caspase-1 and inducible nitric oxide synthetase upregulation, and reduces infarction. As caspase-1 and nitric oxide seem to play a role in Huntington disease, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of minocycline in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington disease. We report that minocycline delays disease progression, inhibits caspase-1 and caspase-3 mRNA upregulation, and decreases inducible nitric oxide synthetase activity. In addition, effective pharmacotherapy in R6/2 mice requires caspase-1 and caspase-3 inhibition. This is the first demonstration of caspase-1 and caspase-3 transcriptional regulation in a Huntington disease model.
11264541	Interference by huntingtin and atrophin-1 with cbp-mediated transcription leading to cellular toxicity.	Expanded polyglutamine repeats have been proposed to cause neuronal degeneration in Huntington's disease (HD) and related disorders, through abnormal interactions with other proteins containing short polyglutamine tracts such as the transcriptional coactivator CREB binding protein, CBP. We found that CBP was depleted from its normal nuclear location and was present in polyglutamine aggregates in HD cell culture models, HD transgenic mice, and human HD postmortem brain. Expanded polyglutamine repeats specifically interfere with CBP-activated gene transcription, and overexpression of CBP rescued polyglutamine-induced neuronal toxicity. Thus, polyglutamine-mediated interference with CBP-regulated gene transcription may constitute a genetic gain of function, underlying the pathogenesis of polyglutamine disorders.
11973620	Predictive DNA-testing for Huntington's disease and reproductive decision making: a European collaborative study.	This European collaborative study addresses the question whether a predictive test result for Huntington's disease (HD) has an effect on subsequent reproduction by comparing carriers and non-carriers of the Huntington mutation. A unique characteristic of this study is that this evaluation is done in persons at reproductive age who had a predictive test after the identification of the Huntington gene and who were counselled in one of the participating centres. Data were collected for 180 carriers and 271 non-carriers who received a predictive test result in the period 1993-1998 in Aberdeen, Athens, Cardiff, Leiden, Leuven, Paris or Rome. The mean age of the total study group was 31.5 years and for about half of the group the follow-up interval was 3 years or more, with a maximum of 7 years. The collaborative study clearly revealed an overall impact of the predictive test result on subsequent reproduction: 14% of the carriers had one or more subsequent pregnancies vs 28% of the non-carriers. In the total carrier group a prenatal test was carried out in about two thirds of the pregnancies and one child was born after preimplantation genetic diagnosis; artificial insemination by donor, egg cell donation or adoption were not reported. A more refined analysis was performed in the subgroup with a follow-up interval of at least 3 years and who reported 'family planning' as a motive to apply for predictive testing in the pretest period. The complexity of this motive is discussed. In this subgroup with a desire for children in the pretest period the effect of the predictive test result was more pronounced: 69% of the non-carriers had subsequent pregnancies while only 39% of the carriers who mentioned 'family planning' as one of the major reasons to apply for predictive testing had a subsequent pregnancy. Of the carriers with one or more subsequent pregnancies the percentage using prenatal diagnosis was slightly higher than the percentage not using it, although there were clear differences from one centre to another. The latter group's decisions may seem more intriguing but may be partially understood based on stage theories of health behaviour. Last, but not least, whatever option is chosen by a couple at increased risk of transmitting the Huntington mutation, it is of the utmost importance that professionals fully respect this decision and support the couple.
9397019	Impaired recognition of disgust in Huntington's disease gene carriers.	Face processing and facial expression recognition were investigated in the earliest stages of Huntington's disease, by studying 40 people who presented for genetic testing. Twenty-three of these 'at risk' individuals turned out not to carry the gene for Huntington's disease (the AR- group). Seventeen were found to be gene carriers (the AR+ group); 15 from genetic testing, and two who showed signs of early stages of Huntington's disease. A number of standard tasks were used to provide background information, including recognition memory for words, picture naming, verbal fluency, and figure copying; none revealed significant differences between the AR+ and AR- groups. Face processing abilities were investigated using tests of identification of familiar (famous) faces, unfamiliar face matching, recognition memory for faces, and recognition of facial expressions of emotion. No statistically significant differences between the AR+ and AR- groups were found for any of these tests, but the AR+ group showed a borderline overall impairment in recognizing facial expressions of emotion (0.05 < P < 0.1). When recognition of each of the six basic emotions used was examined separately, only disgust was found to be significantly impaired. This highly selective deficit in the recognition of disgust was confirmed in the subgroup of 15 individuals shown by genetic testing to be Huntington's gene carriers; it was therefore found in people who were free from clinical symptoms and did not perform significantly more poorly than non-carriers on any of the background tests, on any of the other face processing tasks, and even for recognition of any other basic emotion. This points strongly to the importance of the basal ganglia in the emotion of disgust.
9804379	Transgenic mice in the study of polyglutamine repeat expansion diseases.	An increasing number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD), have been found to be caused by a CAG/polyglutamine expansion. We have generated a mouse model of HD by the introduction of exon 1 of the human HD gene carrying highly expanded CAG repeats into the mouse germ line. These mice develop a progressive neurological phenotype. Neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NII) that are immunoreactive for huntingtin and ubiquitin have been found in the brains of symptomatic mice. In vitro analysis indicates that the inclusions are formed through self aggregation via the polyglutamine repeat into amyloid-like fibrils composed of a cross beta-sheet structure that has been termed a polar zipper. Analysis of patient material and other transgenic lines has now shown NII to be a common feature of all of these diseases. In the transgenic models, inclusions are present prior to the onset of symptoms suggesting a causal relationship. In contrast, neurodegeneration occurs after the onset of the phenotype indicating that the symptoms are caused by a neuronal dysfunction rather than a primary cell death.
9894873	Biochemical abnormalities and excitotoxicity in Huntington's disease brain.	The physiological role of huntingtin and the mechanisms by which the expanded CAG repeat in ITI5 and its polyglutamine stretch in mutant huntingtin induce Huntington's disease (HD) are unknown. Several techniques have now demonstrated abnormal metabolism in HD brain; direct measurement of respiratory chain enzyme activities has shown severe deficiency of complex II/III and a milder defect of complex IV. We confirm that these abnormalities appear to be confined to the striatum within the HD brain. Analysis of complex II/III activity in HD fibroblasts was normal, despite expression of mutant huntingtin. Although glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (a huntingtin binding protein) activity was normal in all areas studied, aconitase activity was decreased to 8% in HD caudate, 27% in putamen, and 52% in cerebral cortex, but normal in HD cerebellum and fibroblasts. We have demonstrated that although complexes II and III are those parts of the respiratory chain most vulnerable to inhibition in the presence of a nitric oxide (NO*) generator, aconitase activity was even more sensitive to inhibition. The pattern of these enzyme deficiencies and their parallel to the anatomical distribution of HD pathology support an important role for NO* and excitotoxicity in HD pathogenesis. Furthermore, based on the biochemical defects we have described, we suggest that NO* generation produces a graded response, with aconitase inhibition followed by complex II/III inhibition and the initiation of a self-amplifying cycle of free radical generation and aconitase inhibition, which results in severe ATP depletion. We propose that these events are important in determining neuronal cell death and are critical steps in the pathogenesis of HD.
10222105	Recent advances on the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease.	We review recent advances regarding the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD). This genetic neurodegenerative disorder is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in a gene coding for a protein, with unknown function, called huntingtin. There is selective death of striatal and cortical neurons. Both in patients and a transgenic mouse model of the disease, neuronal intranuclear inclusions, immunoreactive for huntingtin and ubiquitin, develop. Huntingtin interacts with the proteins GAPDH, HAP-1, HIP1, HIP2, and calmodulin, and a mutant huntingtin is specifically cleaved by the proapoptotic enzyme caspase 3. The pathogenetic mechanism is not known, but it is presumed that there is a toxic gain of function of the mutant huntingtin. Circumstantial evidence suggests that excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, impaired energy metabolism, and apoptosis play a role.
10434295	From neuronal inclusions to neurodegeneration: neuropathological investigation of a transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease.	Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine repeat sequence within a novel protein. Recent work has shown that abnormal intranuclear inclusions of aggregated mutant protein within neurons is a characteristic feature shared by HD and several other diseases involving glutamine repeat expansion. This suggests that in each of the these disorders the affected nerve cells degenerate as a result of these abnormal inclusions. A transgenic mouse model of HD has been generated by introducing exon 1 of the HD gene containing a highly expanded CAG sequence into the mouse germline. These mice develop widespread neuronal intranuclear inclusions and neurodegeneration specifically within those areas of the brain known to degenerate in HD. We have investigated the sequence of pathological changes that occur after the formation of nuclear inclusions and that precede neuronal cell death in these cells. Although the relation between inclusion formation and neurodegeneration has recently been questioned, a full characterization of the pathways linking protein aggregation and cell death will resolve some of these controversies and will additionally provide new targets for potential therapies.
12900792	A genome scan for modifiers of age at onset in Huntington disease: The HD MAPS study.	Huntington disease (HD) is caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat within the coding region of a novel gene on 4p16.3. Although the variation in age at onset is partly explained by the size of the expanded repeat, the unexplained variation in age at onset is strongly heritable (h2=0.56), which suggests that other genes modify the age at onset of HD. To identify these modifier loci, we performed a 10-cM density genomewide scan in 629 affected sibling pairs (295 pedigrees and 695 individuals), using ages at onset adjusted for the expanded and normal CAG repeat sizes. Because all those studied were HD affected, estimates of allele sharing identical by descent at and around the HD locus were adjusted by a positionally weighted method to correct for the increased allele sharing at 4p. Suggestive evidence for linkage was found at 4p16 (LOD=1.93), 6p21-23 (LOD=2.29), and 6q24-26 (LOD=2.28), which may be useful for investigation of genes that modify age at onset of HD.
7804665	A controlled psychiatric study of individuals at risk for Huntington's disease.	BACKGROUND: The study tested specific hypotheses that (a) there is an increased incidence of psychiatric disorders in asymptomatic heterozygotes for Huntington's disease (HD) compared with the normal homozygotes, and (b) there is an increased incidence of psychiatric disorders in the adult offspring of Huntington's disease patients compared with their partners. METHOD: A controlled study was made of 93 apparently healthy individuals (at 50% risk), who had given DNA samples for the predictive test, and 70 of their partners. Current and past psychopathology was assessed and compared with the DNA predictive test results based on linkage analyses. The results of psychiatric assessments of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: DNA test results were available for 53 subjects (of 93). Five subjects at risk for HD were omitted from the study. The asymptomatic heterozygotes (n = 20) showed no significant increase in the incidence of any psychiatric episode, depression, schizophrenia or behavioural disorder when compared with the normal homozygotes (n = 33). The whole tested group showed a significantly greater number of psychiatric episodes than their partners (n = 43). CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic HD gene carriers do not have a greater incidence of psychiatric disorders than the non-gene carriers born to a HD parent.
8272987	Dental management of a child with Huntington's disease: case report.	Huntington's Disease is a chronic, progressive, hereditary disorder of unknown etiology. Onset occurs between 35 and 42 years of age and is characterized by chorea, behavioral changes, dementia, and irregular gait. Dyslalia is a common feature due to the severe darting movements of the tongue and head. Huntington's Disease is rarely diagnosed in children (less than 1% of all cases are documented in children under 10 years of age). This is a case report of an 11 year 5 month old white male, diagnosed at age 5, who was brought to the University of Minnesota Hospital Dental Clinic for an oral examination. The findings are presented, and the management of patients with Huntington's Disease is discussed.
9427501	Huntington's disease gene product, huntingtin, associates with microtubules in vitro.	The gene responsible for Huntington's disease produces a large protein with a molecular weight of approximately 350 k, designated huntingtin. Here, we report that the protein can associate in vitro with the microtubules. Through the process of assembly and disassembly of microtubules, both wild-type and mutant huntingtin associate with microtubules to almost the same degree. Huntingtin does not bind to the tubulin-affinity column directly. Huntingtin appears to interact with polymerized tubulin. These results suggest that huntingtin may have a role in intracellular organelle transport or axonal transport by its association with microtubules.
10468506	Reduced basal ganglia blood flow and volume in pre-symptomatic, gene-tested persons at-risk for Huntington's disease.	The aim of this study was to examine basal ganglia volumes and regional cerebral blood flow in asymptomatic subjects at-risk for Huntington's disease who had undergone genetic testing. We determined which measures were the best 'markers' for the presence of the mutation and for the onset of symptoms. Twenty subjects who were Huntington's disease gene mutation-positive and 24 Huntington's disease gene mutation-negative participants, all of whom had a parent with genetically confirmed Huntington's disease, and were therefore 50% at-risk for inheriting the Huntington's disease gene mutation, were included in the study. To evaluate basal ganglia structure and function, MRI and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were used. Quantitative measures of regional volumes and relative measures of regional perfusion were calculated. SPECT and MRI scans were co-registered so that MRI anatomy could be used accurately to place SPECT regions. Estimated years-to-onset in the mutation-positive subjects was calculated based on a regression formula that included gene (CAG)(n) repeat length and parental age of onset. Changes in imaging measures in relation to estimated years-to-onset were assessed. The imaging measure that was most affected in mutation-positive subjects was putamen volume. This was also the measure that correlated most strongly with approaching onset. In subjects >/=7 years from estimated onset age, the putamen volume measures were similar to those of the mutation-negative subjects. However, in subjects </=6 years from estimated onset age, there were dramatic reductions in putamen volume, resulting in >90% discrimination from both the far-from-onset and the mutation-negative subjects. Caudate volume and bicaudate ratio also showed a significant decline in the close-to-onset subjects, although to a lesser degree than putamen volume reductions. Furthermore, SPECT basal ganglia perfusion deficits were observed in mutation-positive subjects. Imaging markers of neuropathological decline preceding clinical onset are important for assessing the effects of treatments aimed at slowing the course of Huntington's disease. The current study suggests that quantitative assessment of basal ganglia may provide a means to track early signs of decline in individuals with the Huntington's disease gene mutation prior to clinical onset.
10754231	Early kynurenergic impairment in Huntington's disease and in a transgenic animal model.	Several neuroactive metabolites of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation have been speculatively linked to the pathophysiology of Huntington's Disease (HD). Here we demonstrate that the levels of two of these metabolites, the free radical generator 3-hydroxykynurenine (3HK) and the neuroprotectant kynurenate (KYNA), are increased in the neostriatum of stage 1 HD patients and in the brain of mice transgenic for full-length mutant huntingtin. In both cases, the elevation in 3HK was far more pronounced, resulting in significant increases in the 3HK/KYNA ratios. These data suggest that abnormal kynurenine pathway metabolism may play a role during the early phases of the neurodegenerative process in HD.
11128600	Huntington disease: new insights on the role of huntingtin cleavage.	Huntington Disease (HD) results from polyglutamine expansion within the N-terminus of huntingtin. We have produced yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) transgenic mice expressing normal (YAC18) and mutant (YAC46 and YAC72) human huntingtin in a developmentally appropriate and tissue-specific manner identical to the pattern of expression of endogenous huntingtin. YAC46 and YAC72 mice show early electrophysiological abnormalities indicating neuronal cytoplasmic dysfunction prior to developing nuclear inclusions or neurodegeneration. YAC72 mice display a hyperkinetic movement disorder by 7 months of age, and have evidence for selective and specific degeneration of medium spiny neurons in the lateral striatum by 12 months of age. A key molecular feature of pathology of these YAC72 mice is cleavage of huntingtin in the cytoplasm following by translocation of the resulting huntingtin N-terminal fragments into the nucleus of striatal neurons. Increasing nuclear localization of huntingtin N-terminal fragments within medium spiny neurons of the striatum occurs concomitantly with the onset of selective neurodegeneration. Because huntingtin is a caspase substrate and truncated huntingtin fragments are toxic in vitro, inhibiting caspase cleavage of huntingtin may be of potential therapeutic benefit in HD. We show that caspase inhibitors eliminate huntingtin cleavage in cells and protects them from an apoptotic stress. We also identify caspase-6 and caspase-3 cleavage sites in huntingtin and demonstrate that neuronal and non-neuronal cells expressing a caspase-resistant huntingtin with an expanded polyglutamine tract are less susceptible to apoptosis and aggregate formation. These results suggest that caspase cleavage of huntingtin may be a crucial step in aggregate formation and neurotoxicity in HD.
11408619	Loss of huntingtin-mediated BDNF gene transcription in Huntington's disease.	Huntingtin is a 350-kilodalton protein of unknown function that is mutated in Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disorder. The mutant protein is presumed to acquire a toxic gain of function that is detrimental to striatal neurons in the brain. However, loss of a beneficial activity of wild-type huntingtin may also cause the death of striatal neurons. Here we demonstrate that wild-type huntingtin up-regulates transcription of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a pro-survival factor produced by cortical neurons that is necessary for survival of striatal neurons in the brain. We show that this beneficial activity of huntingtin is lost when the protein becomes mutated, resulting in decreased production of cortical BDNF. This leads to insufficient neurotrophic support for striatal neurons, which then die. Restoring wild-type huntingtin activity and increasing BDNF production may be therapeutic approaches for treating HD.
11889126	HIP1 and HIP12 display differential binding to F-actin, AP2, and clathrin. Identification of a novel interaction with clathrin light chain.	Huntingtin-interacting protein 1 (HIP1) and HIP12 are orthologues of Sla2p, a yeast protein with essential functions in endocytosis and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. We now report that HIP1 and HIP12 are major components of the clathrin coat that interact but differ in their ability to bind clathrin and the clathrin adaptor AP2. HIP1 contains a clathrin-box and AP2 consensus-binding sites that display high affinity binding to the terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain and the ear domain of the AP2 alpha subunit, respectively. These consensus sites are poorly conserved in HIP12 and correspondingly, HIP12 does not bind to AP2 nor does it demonstrate high affinity clathrin binding. Moreover, HIP12 co-sediments with F-actin in contrast to HIP1, which exhibits no interaction with actin in vitro. Despite these differences, both proteins efficiently stimulate clathrin assembly through their central helical domain. Interestingly, in both HIP1 and HIP12, this domain binds directly to the clathrin light chain. Our data suggest that HIP1 and HIP12 play related yet distinct functional roles in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
10222788	[The function of Huntington disease gene product (huntingtin) and the pathomechanism of Huntington disease].	The recent knowledges about the functions of huntingtin and the pathomechanism of Huntington disease are reviewed. Several binding proteins such as HAP1, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, HIP1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase(GAPDH), and cystathionine beta-synthase are identified. One of the functions of huntingtin suggested by those binding proteins is organella transport. In addition huntington binds with WW domain proteins and SH3 domain. The most exciting discovery of Huntington disease pathomechanism is identification of nuclear inclusions in transgenic mouse model of Huntington disease. The discussion about the significance of nuclear inclusion for the cell death was reviewed.
10613908	An actin-binding protein of the Sla2/Huntingtin interacting protein 1 family is a novel component of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles.	The actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in endocytosis, yet few molecules that link these systems have been identified. Here, we have cloned and characterized mHip1R, a protein that is closely related to huntingtin interacting protein 1 (Hip1). These two proteins are mammalian homologues of Sla2p, an actin binding protein important for actin organization and endocytosis in yeast. Sequence alignments and secondary structure predictions verified that mHip1R belongs to the Sla2 protein family. Thus, mHip1R contains an NH(2)-terminal domain homologous to that implicated in Sla2p's endocytic function, three predicted coiled-coils, a leucine zipper, and a talin-like actin-binding domain at the COOH terminus. The talin-like domain of mHip1R binds to F-actin in vitro and colocalizes with F-actin in vivo, indicating that this activity has been conserved from yeast to mammals. mHip1R shows a punctate immunolocalization and is enriched at the cell cortex and in the perinuclear region. We concluded that the cortical localization represents endocytic compartments, because mHip1R colocalizes with clathrin, AP-2, and endocytosed transferrin, and because mHip1R fractionates biochemically with clathrin-coated vesicles. Time-lapse video microscopy of mHip1R-green fluorescence protein (GFP) revealed a blinking behavior similar to that reported for GFP-clathrin, and an actin-dependent inward movement of punctate structures from the cell periphery. These data show that mHip1R is a component of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles and suggest that it might link the endocytic machinery to the actin cytoskeleton.
10644798	Late onset levodopa responsive Huntington's disease with minimal chorea masquerading as Parkinson plus syndrome.	Huntington's disease is characterised by hyperkinetic movements, mainly chorea, cognitive dysfunction, and psychiatric abnormalities. Non-dopa responsive parkinsonism occurs in the later stages of choreic disease or as the predominant feature of juvenile patients (Westphal variant). Late onset Huntington's disease presenting as levodopa responsive parkinsonism is rare. A series of four patients with late onset Huntington's disease presenting as levodopa responsive parkinsonism and cardiovascular dysautonomia, initially misdiagnosed as multiple system atrophy (MSA) in three patients, is reported. Levodopa treatment did not unmask significant chorea. These cases suggest the presence of a distinct phenotypic variant of Huntington's disease to be added to the differential diagnosis of other akinetic rigid syndromes.
11380269	Genetic testing and mental health: the model of Huntington disease.	Genetic aspects of mental health disorders are being identified through human genome and family research. Gene discovery makes diagnostic and presymptomatic testing possible. The discovery of a gene mutation for Huntington Disease (HD) enables at-risk persons to request presymptomatic genetic testing. When HD genetic testing is offered through HD testing centers, a multi-visit protocol is followed in which education and counseling are provided for persons considering the option to have HD gene testing. A case study illustrates the clinical and ethical issues regarding privacy and disclosure as well as the personal and family consequences of gene mutation knowledge. Analysis of the impact of genetic knowledge on persons being tested for HD provides a model for the integration of emerging genetic information into mental health nursing practice for other mental health disorders.
7581375	Expression of the Huntington's disease (IT15) protein product in HD patients.	Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited, neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in the IT15 gene, leading to an expanded glutamine repeat in the HD protein. The mechanism by which the expanded repeat causes expression of the disease is not known, though there do not appear to be changes in the mRNA levels. We have conducted quantitative Western blot analyses of HD patients and controls. Expression of the IT15 protein is essentially equal in control and HD frontal cortex. In caudate from HD patients, IT15 protein is decreased in parallel with the decrease in a neuronal marker, suggesting that loss of IT15 protein is secondary to neuronal loss. In order to determine expression of the two alleles of the IT15 protein we used Western blots of 4% polyacrylamide gels. Both alleles of the IT15 protein were expressed at similar levels in HD lymphoblastoid cell lines and HD post-mortem hippocampus and cerebellum (regions relatively spared in HD), indicating that even very long CAG repeats can be translated into polyglutamine. In contrast, in cerebral cortex and caudate (regions severely affected in HD), in the longer expanded repeat cases the expanded allele of the IT15 protein was present at a significantly lower level (compared with the normal length allele), often with a smear of more slowly migrating reactivity above it. These data suggest the possibility of altered structure, abnormal processing or abnormality of protein-protein interactions involving the IT15 protein with the expanded glutamine repeat.
7662892	Effects of striatal excitotoxicity on huntingtin-like immunoreactivity.	The relationship between the specific neuronal loss observed in Huntington's disease and the mutation in the IT15 gene responsible for this disease remains obscure. Using an antipeptide antibody against amino acids 3114-3141 of the human huntington protein, we demonstrate that striatal injection of quinolinic acid in mice induces increased immunoreactivity for huntington in some remaining neurons but not in glial cells. This increase is apparent in both neuronal cell bodies and in cell processes in the white matter six hours after excitotoxic challenge. This finding suggests that huntington may be involved in the response to excitotoxic stress in these neurons.
9392570	Differential distribution of the normal and mutated forms of huntingtin in the human brain.	Huntington's disease is an inherited disorder caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the IT15 gene, which leads to expansion of a polyglutamine tract within the protein called huntingtin. Despite the characterization of the IT15 gene and the mutation involved in the disease, the normal function of huntingtin and the effects of the mutation on its function and on its neuronal location remain unknown. To study whether mutated huntingtin has the same neuronal distribution and intracellular location as normal huntingtin, we analyzed immunohistochemically both forms of this protein in the brain of 5 controls and 5 patients with Huntington's disease. We show that the distribution of mutated huntingtin is, like that of the normal form, heterogeneous throughout the brain, but is not limited to vulnerable neurons in Huntington's disease, supporting the hypothesis that the presence of the mutated huntingtin in a neuron is not in itself sufficient to lead to neuronal death. Moreover, whereas normal huntingtin is detected in some neuronal perikarya, nerve fibers, and nerve endings, the mutated form is observed in some neuronal perikarya and proximal nerve processes but is not detectable in nerve endings. Our results suggest that the expression or processing of the mutated huntingtin in perikarya and nerve endings differs quantitatively or qualitatively from the expression of the normal form in the same neuronal compartments.
11723754	[From gene to disease; HD gene and Huntington disease].	Huntington's disease (HD) is a late onset, incurable, autosomal dominantly-inherited, progressive neuropsychiatric disease, characterised by chorea, changes in personality, mood and behaviour, and dementia. Huntington's disease is a clinical diagnosis. The advent of DNA diagnosis has made predictive, prenatal and preimplantation testing possible for at-risk persons or asymptomatic carriers. The prevalence is estimated to be 3-10/100,000 among individuals of European descent; HD is less common in other ethnic groups. Huntington's disease is caused by an expanded trinucleotide CAG repeat in the HD gene on chromosome 4. The gene encodes for the protein huntingtin, with an as yet unknown function. The mutated huntingtin has an elongated stretch of glutamines which leads to a gain of function such as overactivity, excitotoxicity, or to interactions with other proteins.
12691731	Overexpression and nuclear accumulation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in a transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease.	Huntington's disease is due to an expansion of CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene. Huntingtin interacts with several proteins including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). We performed immunohistochemical analysis of GAPDH expression in the brains of transgenic mice carrying the huntingtin gene with 89 CAG repeats. In all wild-type animals examined, GAPDH was evenly distributed among the different cell types throughout the brain. In contrast, the majority of transgenic mice showed GAPDH overexpression, with the most prominent GAPDH changes observed in the caudate putamen, globus pallidus, neocortex, and hippocampal formation. Double staining for NeuN and GFAP revealed that GAPDH overexpression occurred exclusively in neurons. Nissl staining analysis of the neocortex and caudate putamen indicated 24 and 27% of cell loss in transgenic mice, respectively. Subcellular fluorescence analysis revealed a predominant increase in GAPDH immunostaining in the nucleus. Thus, we conclude that mutation of huntingtin is associated with GAPDH overexpression and nuclear translocation in discrete populations of brain neurons.
9668110	A human HAP1 homologue. Cloning, expression, and interaction with huntingtin.	Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by the expansion of a glutamine repeat in the protein huntingtin. The expanded glutamine repeat is thought to mediate a gain of function by causing huntingtin to abnormally interact with other proteins. We previously identified a rat huntingtin-associated protein (HAP1) that binds to huntingtin; HAP1 binds more tightly to huntingtin with an expanded glutamine repeat than to wild type huntingtin. Identification of the human homologue of HAP1 is necessary for investigation of the potential role of HAP1 in HD pathology. Here, we report the cloning of a human HAP1 homologue (hHAP) that shares 62% identity with rat HAP1 over its entire sequence and 82% amino acid identity in the putative huntingtin-binding region. The hHAP gene encodes a 4.1-kilobase transcript and a 75-kDa protein which are specifically expressed in human brain tissues. Its expression in Huntington's disease brains is reduced in parallel with a decreased expression of huntingtin. While two isoforms of rat HAP1 are expressed at similar levels in rat brain, only a single major form of hHAP is found in primate brains. In vitro binding, immunoprecipitation, and coexpression studies confirm the interaction of hHAP with huntingtin. The in vitro binding of hHAP to huntingtin is enhanced by lengthening the glutamine repeat. Despite similar binding properties of rat HAP1 and hHAP, differences in the sequences and expression of hHAP may contribute to a specific role for its interaction with huntingtin in humans.
9714810	Mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.	A potential pivotal role for mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases is gaining increasing acceptance. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to a number of deleterious consequences including impaired calcium buffering, generation of free radicals, activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition and secondary excitotoxicity. Neurodegenerative diseases of widely disparate genetic etiologies may share mitochondrial dysfunction as a final common pathway. Recent studies using cybrid cell lines suggest that sporadic Alzheimer's disease is associated with a deficiency of cytochrome oxidase. Friedreich's ataxia is caused by an expanded GAA repeat resulting in dysfunction of frataxin, a nuclear encoded mitochondrial protein involved in mitochondrial iron transport. This results in increased mitochondrial iron and oxidative damage. Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is associated with point mutations in superoxide dismutase, which may lead to increased generation of free radicals and thereby contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction. Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in an unknown protein termed huntingtin. The means by which this leads to energy impairment is unclear, however studies in both HD patients and a transgenic mouse model show evidence of bioenergetic defects. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to oxidative damage which is well documented in several neurodegenerative diseases. Therapeutic approaches include methods to buffer intracellular ATP and to scavenge free radicals.
9888310	Analysis of Huntingtin-associated protein 1 in mouse brain and immortalized striatal neurons.	"Huntingtin, the protein product of the Huntington's disease (HD) gene, is expressed with an expanded polyglutamine domain in the brain and in nonneuronal tissues in patients with HD. Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP-1), a brain-enriched protein, interacts preferentially with mutant huntingtin and thus may be important in HD pathogenesis. The function of HAP-1 is unknown, but recent evidence supports a role in microtubule-dependent organelle transport. We examined the subcellular localization of HAP-1 with an antibody made against the NH2-terminus of the protein. In immunoblot assays of mouse brain and immortalized striatal neurons, HAP-1 subtypes A and B migrated together at about 68 kD and separately at 95 kD and 110 kD, respectively. In dividing clonal striatal cells, HAP-1 localized to the mitotic spindle apparatus, especially at spindle poles and on vesicles and microtubules of the spindle body. Postmitotic striatal neurons had punctate HAP-1 labeling throughout the cytoplasm. Western blot analysis of protein extracts obtained after subcellular fractionation and differential centrifugation of the clonal striatal cells showed that HAP-1B was preferentially enriched in membrane fractions. Electron microscopic study of adult mouse basal forebrain and striatum showed HAP-1 localized to membrane-bound organelles including large endosomes, tubulovesicular structures, and budding vesicles in neurons. HAP-1 was also strongly associated with an unusual large ""dense"" organelle. Microtubules were labeled in dendrites and axonal fibers. Results support a role for HAP-1 in vesicle trafficking and organelle movement in mitotic cells and differentiated neurons and implicate HAP-1B as the predominant molecular subtype associated with vesicle membranes in striatal neurons."
11234911	Short-term effects of olanzapine in Huntington disease.	OBJECTIVE: The aim was to describe the short-term (6 months) effects of olanzapine on behavioral and motor clinical manifestations in a group of 11 patients with Huntington disease. METHOD: An open-pilot study of olanzapine (5 mg) in patients with clinical and genetic diagnosis of Huntington disease was used. The Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale for clinical assessment and the Total Functional Capacity score for the disease-stage evaluation were used. A statistical analysis was performed to compare the effects of olanzapine on the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale scores at time 0 (baseline) and at time 1 (6 months). Comparisons of motor scores, of single behavioral items, and of TFC scores were performed within the group. RESULTS: The behavioral assessment score of items regarding depression, anxiety, irritability, and obsessions showed a significant improvement (range of p, 0.0134-0.048). Given the total behavioral scores (sum of all the items investigated), five patients significantly improved their behavioral score after a 6-month treatment (range of p, 0.013-0.047). Choreic movements improved, although not significantly (0.05 < or = p < or = 1). CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine is a potentially useful antipsychotic drug, with significant short-term effects on behavioral changes, mainly in patients with severe psychiatric symptoms at the onset. It might be considered as a possible therapeutic choice for treatment of Huntington disease.
12476935	Gene polymorphism and coronary risk factors in Indian population.	Asian Indians who have settled overseas and those in urban India have increased risk of coronary events. Reasons for this increased risk are thought to be genetic but are yet unclear. Advances in molecular cardiology have revealed a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with atherosclerosis. In this review, gene polymorphisms that have been associated with coronary diseases among Indians are discussed. Topics include the genes involved in hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and homocysteine. Mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene resulting in familial hypercholesterolemia have strong association with premature atherosclerosis. Common polymorphism of the apolipoproteins (apo) B-100 and E genes have been associated with variation in lipid and lipoprotein levels. Recently identified polymorphisms in the apoC3 (T-455C, C-482T), and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) (B1/B2 allele) genes are associated with increased triglycerides and reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-levels, a feature now also common among Asian Indians. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-deletion (DD) polymorphism has been shown to influence beta-blocker therapy in heart failure. Mutations in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (C667T), cystathionine beta-synthase (T833C), and methionine synthase (A2756G) genes cause hyperhomocysteinemia, an independent risk factor for atherothrombosis. As the genetics of atherosclerosis continues to evolve, these factors along with the newer emerging factors may become a part of the routine assessment, aiding prediction of future coronary events.
9949443	Preimplantation diagnosis for Huntington's disease (HD): clinical application and analysis of the HD expansion in affected embryos.	Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by motor disturbance, cognitive loss and psychiatric manifestations, starting between the fourth and the fifth decade, followed by death within 10-20 years of onset of the disease. The disease-causing mutation is an expansion of a CAG triplet repeat at the 5' coding end of the Huntington gene. We have developed a single-cell PCR assay for the HD gene in order to propose preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for the couples at risk. We present here our first results with our first nine PGD cycles and also discuss the behaviour of the disease-causing expansion in pre-implantation embryos.
11268768	[Huntington chorea. A clinically relevant differential diagnosis in geriatric psychiatry patients?].	"We report on seven geropsychiatric patients, aged 62 to 86, who had received either in- or outpatient psychiatric treatment for different disorders before being diagnosed with Huntington's disease (HD) by molecular biological methods. At the time of diagnosis, these patients presented only with mild involuntary movements in addition to other, nonspecific psychiatric symptoms such as depressive, paranoid, or dementia symptoms. In six of the seven cases, the HD symptoms had previously been misdiagnosed as tardive dyskinesia because these patients had been treated with neuroleptics in the past. Family histories were nonspecific. Three of the seven patients had family members who were described as ""mentally ill"" and already deceased. Huntington's disease (HD) should be considered as a differential diagnosis in geropsychiatric patients presenting nonspecific psychiatric symptoms."
11738472	Cross linking of polyglutamine domains catalyzed by tissue transglutaminase is greatly favored with pathological-length repeats: does transglutaminase activity play a role in (CAG)(n)/Q(n)-expansion diseases?	Protein aggregates are a hallmark of Huntington's disease (HD) and other inherited neurodegenerative diseases caused by an elongated (CAG)(n) repeat in the genome and to a corresponding increase in the size of the Q(n) domain in the expressed protein. When the protein associated with HD (huntingtin) contains <35 Q repeats disease does not occur. However, an n>/=40 leads to disease. Some investigators have proposed that aggregates in the nuclei of affected cells are toxic, but other workers have suggested that the aggregates may be neutral or even protective. Whether or not they are toxic, an understanding of the processes whereby the aggregates develop may shed light on the neuropathological processes involved in the (CAG)(n)/Q(n)-expansion disorders. Q(n) domains have a tendency to non-covalently self align as 'polar zippers' rendering them less soluble, but evidence that such polar zippers occur in the aggregates in intact HD brain has so far been limited. The human brain contains at least three Ca(2+)-dependent enzymes (transglutaminases, TGases) that catalyze protein cross-linking reactions, namely TGase 1, TGase 2 (tissue transglutaminase, tTGase) and TGase 3. Q(n) aggregates have been found by several groups to be excellent substrates of tTGase. Moreover, the activity toward the Q(n) domains increases greatly as n is increased to 40 or beyond. tTGase mRNA and total TGase activity are elevated in HD brain. Moreover, some evidence suggests that Ca(2+) homeostasis is disrupted in HD brain. We propose that the combination of increased huntingtin (or huntingtin fragment containing the Q(n) domain) in the nucleus, increased the ability of the Q(n) domains to act as substrate, increased Ca(2+) levels and increased inherent TGase activity all contribute to increased cross-linking of proteins in HD brain. At first the proteasome machinery can recognize and degrade the cross-linked proteins, but over time the proteasome machinery may be overwhelmed and protein aggregates will accumulate.
14512712	Perceptual categorization is impaired in Huntington's disease: an electrophysiological study.	Recent evidence raised the possibility that the neostriatum and the corticostriatal circuits could play an important role in semantic categorization. In this study, we examined the electrophysiological correlates of natural scene categorization in Huntington's disease (HD) patients and their asymptomatic relatives who were Huntington's disease mutation carriers (HDC). Event-related potentials were recorded in HD patients, HDC subjects, and age-matched control subjects using a natural scene categorization task. The subjects had to decide whether a briefly presented image contained animals or no animals. Concerning the N1 component (150-250 ms), the mean amplitudes were more negative for nonanimal scenes as compared with stimuli containing animals at all electrode sites in the control group and at all but the lateral temporal electrode sites (T3, T4) in the HD group. Between-group comparison demonstrated that the N1 amplitudes were significantly smaller for both kinds of stimuli in the HD group in spite of a normal primary occipital component (P100). The HDC subjects were not significantly different from the controls concerning the N1 amplitudes. These results suggest that perceptual (N1) processes related to the categorization of natural scenes are specifically impaired in HD. The findings are in agreement with the hypothesis emphasizing the importance of neostriatal mechanisms in human categorization functions.
11698589	Proteasomal-dependent aggregate reversal and absence of cell death in a conditional mouse model of Huntington's disease.	Neuronal intranuclear inclusions are a histopathological hallmark of Huntington's disease. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism by which they are formed and their relevance to neuronal cell death and/or dysfunction remains unclear. We recently generated a conditional mouse model of Huntington's disease (HD94) in which silencing expression of mutated huntingtin led to the disappearance of intranuclear aggregates and amelioration of the behavioral phenotype. Here, we analyze primary striatal neuronal cultures from HD94 mice to explore the dynamics of aggregate formation and reversal, the possible mechanisms involved, and the correlation between aggregates and neuronal death. In parallel, we examine symptomatic adult HD94 mice in similar studies and explored the relationship between aggregate clearance and behavioral reversal. We report that, in culture, aggregate formation and reversal were rapid processes, such that 2 d of transgene expression led to aggregate formation, and 5 d of transgene suppression led to aggregate disappearance. In mice, full reversal of aggregates and intranuclear mutant huntingtin was more rapid than reported previously and preceded the motor recovery by several weeks. Furthermore, the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin inhibited the aggregate clearance observed in culture, thus indicating that aggregate formation is a balance between the rate of huntingtin synthesis and its degradation by the proteasome. Finally, neither expression of the mutant huntingtin nor aggregates compromised the viability of HD94 cultures. This correlated with the lack of cell death in symptomatic HD94 mice, thus demonstrating that neuronal dysfunction, and not cell loss, triggered by mutant huntingtin underlies symptomatology.
10942430	Polyglutamine length-dependent interaction of Hsp40 and Hsp70 family chaperones with truncated N-terminal huntingtin: their role in suppression of aggregation and cellular toxicity.	Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by polyglutamine expansion in the disease protein, huntingtin. In HD patients and transgenic mice, the affected neurons form characteristic ubiquitin-positive nuclear inclusions (NIs). We have established ecdysone-inducible stable mouse Neuro2a cell lines that express truncated N-terminal huntingtin (tNhtt) with different polyglutamine lengths which form both cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates in a polyglutamine length- and inducer dose-dependent manner. Here we demonstrate that newly synthesized polyglutamine-expanded truncated huntingtin interacts with members of Hsp40 and Hsp70 families of chaperones in a polyglutamine length-dependent manner. Of these interacting chaperones, only Hdj-2 and Hsc70 frequently (Hdj-2 > Hsc70) co-localize with both the aggregates in the cellular model and with the NIs in the brains of HD exon 1 transgenic mice. However, Hdj-2 and Hsc70 do not co-localize with cytoplasmic aggregates in the brains of transgenic mice despite these chaperones being primarily localized in the cytoplasmic compartment. This strongly suggests that the chaperone interaction and their redistribution to the aggregates are two completely different phenomena of the cellular unfolded protein response. This unfolded protein response is also evident from the dramatic induction of Hsp70 on expression of polyglutamine-expanded protein in the cellular model. Transient overexpression of either Hdj-1 or Hsc70 suppresses the aggregate formation; however, suppression efficiency is much higher in Hdj-1 compared with Hsc70. Overexpression of Hdj-1 and Hsc70 is also able to protect cell death caused by polyglutamine-expanded tNhtt and their combination proved to be most effective.
11161468	Mutant huntingtin enhances excitotoxic cell death.	Evidence suggests overactivation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) contributes to selective degeneration of medium-sized spiny striatal neurons in Huntington's disease (HD). Here we determined whether expression of huntingtin containing the polyglutamine expansion augments NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity. HEK293 cells coexpressing mutant huntingtin (htt-138Q) and either NR1A/NR2A- or NR1A/NR2B-type NMDARs exposed to 1 mM NMDA showed a significant increase in excitotoxic cell death compared to controls (cells coexpressing htt-15Q or GFP), but the difference was larger for NR1A/NR2B. Moreover, agonist-dependent cell death showed apoptotic features for cells coexpressing htt-138Q and NR1A/NR2B, but not for cells expressing htt-138Q and NR1A/NR2A. Further, NR1A/NR2B-mediated apoptosis was not seen with coexpression of an N-terminal fragment of mutant htt. Since NR1A/NR2B is the predominant NMDAR subtype in neostriatal medium-sized spiny neurons, enhancement of NMDA-induced apoptotic death in NR1A/NR2B-expressing cells by full-length mutant htt may contribute to selective neurodegeneration in HD.
12498040	[Huntington chorea: genetics and biochemistry, diagnosis and therapy].	Huntington chorea (HC) is a serious neurodegenerative disease. Its genetic background has recently been discovered by positional cloning due to the enormous progress in molecular biology. This disease is caused by the mutation of CAG, a changeable, repetitive Citosin-Adenin-Guanin trinucleotide sequence. The protein coded by this sequence is called huntingtin. The role of huntingtin is known neither in mutant nor in normal proteins, despite several hypotheses on this matter. Nevertheless, in connection with the number of the CAG repeat many regularities have been proved which can be used in diagnosis and also in prediction of the disease. The latter is of great importance since the treatment of HC is still limited to symptomatic therapies, however numerous therapeutical approaches are being observed. In the future, real treatment of this disease is expected from gene therapy. Until the application of this method, the most effective approach is prevention, on the basis of genetic counseling.
10434299	Polyglutamine pathogenesis.	An increasing number of neurodegenerative disorders have been found to be caused by expanding CAG triplet repeats that code for polyglutamine. Huntington's disease (HD) is the most common of these disorders and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is very similar to HD, but is caused by mutation in a different gene, making them good models to study. In this review, we will concentrate on the roles of protein aggregation, nuclear localization and proteolytic processing in disease pathogenesis. In cell model studies of HD, we have found that truncated N-terminal portions of huntingtin (the HD gene product) with expanded repeats form more aggregates than longer or full length huntingtin polypeptides. These shorter fragments are also more prone to aggregate in the nucleus and cause more cell toxicity. Further experiments with huntingtin constructs harbouring exogenous nuclear import and nuclear export signals have implicated the nucleus in direct cell toxicity. We have made mouse models of HD and DRPLA using an N-terminal truncation of huntingtin (N171) and full-length atrophin-1 (the DRPLA gene product), respectively. In both models, diffuse neuronal nuclear staining and nuclear inclusion bodies are observed in animals expressing the expanded glutamine repeat protein, further implicating the nucleus as a primary site of neuronal dysfunction. Neuritic pathology is also observed in the HD mice. In the DRPLA mouse model, we have found that truncated fragments of atrophin-1 containing the glutamine repeat accumulate in the nucleus, suggesting that proteolysis may be critical for disease progression. Taken together, these data lead towards a model whereby proteolytic processing, nuclear localization and protein aggregation all contribute to pathogenesis.
10739639	Decrease in striatal enkephalin mRNA in mouse models of Huntington's disease.	"Huntington's disease is a devastating progressive neurodegenerative illness characterized by massive neuronal loss in the striatum. It is caused by the presence of an expanded CAG repeat in the gene encoding huntingtin, a protein of unknown function. We have examined the expression of neurotransmitters and other antigens present in striatal neurons with immunohistochemistry, and the level of expression of mRNAs encoding enkephalin, substance P, and glutamic acid decarboxylases with quantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry, in the striatum of two mouse models of Huntington's disease: transgenic animals expressing exon 1 of the human huntingtin gene with 144 CAG repeats and ""knock-in"" mice containing a chimeric mouse/human exon 1 with 71 or 94 CAG repeats inserted by homologous targeting. Although the transgenic (but not the knock-in) mice were previously shown to display prominent huntingtin- and ubiquitin-containing nuclear inclusions in striatal neurons, in situ nick translation followed by emulsion autoradiography did not reveal any DNA damage in striatum or cortex in these mice. Immunolabeling for calbindin D 28K, enkephalin, substance P, glutamic acid decarboxylases (M(r) 65,000 or 67,000, GAD65 and GAD67), somatostatin, choline acetyltransferase, parvalbumin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein were remarkably similar in transgenic, knock-in, and wild-type mice. Both transgenic and knock-in mice, however, showed a marked decrease in the level of expression of enkephalin mRNA in striatal neurons without significant decreases in mRNAs encoding substance P, GAD65, or GAD67. The data indicate that decreased expression of enkephalin mRNA may be an early sign of neuronal dysfunction due to the Huntington's disease mutation."
10800956	Nonlinear decrease over time in N-acetyl aspartate levels in the absence of neuronal loss and increases in glutamine and glucose in transgenic Huntington's disease mice.	Mice transgenic for exon I of mutant huntingtin, with 141 CAG repeats, exhibit a profound symptomatology characterized by weight loss, motor disorders, and early death. We performed longitudinal analysis of metabolite levels in these mice using NMR spectroscopy in vivo and in vitro. These mice exhibited a large (53%), nonlinear drop in in vivo N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) levels over time, commencing at approximately 6 weeks of age, coincident with onset of symptoms. These drops in NAA levels occurred in the absence of neuronal death as measured by postmortem Nissl staining and neuronal counting but in the presence of nuclear inclusion bodies. In addition to decreased NAA, these mice showed a large elevation of glucose in the brain (600%) consistent with a diabetic profile and elevations in blood glucose levels both before and after glucose loading. In vitro NMR analysis revealed significant increases in glutamine (100%), taurine (95%) cholines (200%), and scyllo-inositol (333%) and decreases in glutamate (24%) and succinate (47%). These results lead to two conclusions. NAA is reflective of the health of neurons and thus is a noninvasive marker, with a temporal progression similar to nuclear inclusion bodies and symptoms, of neuronal dysfunction in transgenic mice. Second, the presence of elevated glutamine is evidence of a profound metabolic defect. We present arguments that the elevated glutamine results from a decrease in neuronal-glial glutamate-glutamine cycling and a decrease in glutaminase activity.
12056415	Accuracy of genotyping for single nucleotide polymorphisms by a microarray-based single nucleotide polymorphism typing method involving hybridization of short allele-specific oligonucleotides.	Advances in technologies for identifying genetic polymorphisms rapidly and accurately will dramatically accelerate the discovery of disease-related genes. Among a variety of newly described methods for rapid typing of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), gene detection using DNA microarrays is gradually achieving widespread use. This method involves the use of short (11- to 13-mer) allele-specific oligonucleotides. This method allows simultaneous analysis of many SNPs in DNAs from a large number of individuals, in a single experiment. In this work, we evaluated the accuracy of a new microarray-based short allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization method. There is a 96-well formatted array on a single plate, in which up to 256 spots are included in each well. Fluorescent probes for our experiments were produced by multiplex PCR amplification often target SNP-containing regions. We genotyped 192 individuals across a panel of ten single base variations, which included an insertion/deletion polymorphism. For comparison, we genotyped the same individuals for the same SNPs by the method of single-base extension with fluorescence detection. The typing accuracies of the microarray-based PCR-ASO and single-base extension methods were calculated as 99.9% and 99.1%, respectively, on the basis of genotyping results determined by direct sequencing. We conclude that the microarray-based hybridization method using short ASO probes represents a potential breakthrough technology for typing large numbers of SNPs rapidly and efficiently.
12058016	Huntington toxicity in yeast model depends on polyglutamine aggregation mediated by a prion-like protein Rnq1.	The cause of Huntington's disease is expansion of polyglutamine (polyQ) domain in huntingtin, which makes this protein both neurotoxic and aggregation prone. Here we developed the first yeast model, which establishes a direct link between aggregation of expanded polyQ domain and its cytotoxicity. Our data indicated that deficiencies in molecular chaperones Sis1 and Hsp104 inhibited seeding of polyQ aggregates, whereas ssa1, ssa2, and ydj1-151 mutations inhibited expansion of aggregates. The latter three mutants strongly suppressed the polyQ toxicity. Spontaneous mutants with suppressed aggregation appeared with high frequency, and in all of them the toxicity was relieved. Aggregation defects in these mutants and in sis1-85 were not complemented in the cross to the hsp104 mutant, demonstrating an unusual type of inheritance. Since Hsp104 is required for prion maintenance in yeast, this suggested a role for prions in polyQ aggregation and toxicity. We screened a set of deletions of nonessential genes coding for known prions and related proteins and found that deletion of the RNQ1 gene specifically suppressed aggregation and toxicity of polyQ. Curing of the prion form of Rnq1 from wild-type cells dramatically suppressed both aggregation and toxicity of polyQ. We concluded that aggregation of polyQ is critical for its toxicity and that Rnq1 in its prion conformation plays an essential role in polyQ aggregation leading to the toxicity.
12223581	Early motor dysfunction and striosomal distribution of huntingtin microaggregates in Huntington's disease knock-in mice.	Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by a progressive loss of neurons in the striatum and cerebral cortex and is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the gene encoding huntingtin. Mice with the mutation inserted into their own huntingtin gene (knock-in mice) are, genetically, the best models of the human disease. Here we show for the first time that knock-in mice with 94 CAG repeats develop a robust and early motor phenotype at 2 months of age, characterized by increased rearing at night. This initial increase in repetitive movements was followed by decreased locomotion at 4 and 6 months, despite a normal life span. The decrease in striatal enkephalin mRNA that is known to occur at 4 months was not present at 2 months, when increased rearing was observed. Both the hyperactive and hypoactive phases of motor dysfunction preceded the detection of nuclear microaggregates of mutated huntingtin in striatal neurons. Nuclear microaggregates, defined as small huntingtin-positive punctas detected by light microscopy, were very rare at 4 months but became widely distributed in striatal neurons at 6 months. Nuclear inclusions did not appear until 18 months. When present, nuclear microaggregates predominated in the striosomal compartment of the striatum, providing a possible explanation for the different neuronal vulnerability of striatal compartments observed in humans. The early motor phenotype observed in the knock-in mouse is reminiscent of repetitive movements often observed in early HD and provides a novel opportunity to assess the ability of therapies to prevent the initial effects of the mutation in vivo.
12624715	A study of arm movements in Huntington's disease under visually controlled and blindfolded conditions.	The so-called bradykinesia of Huntington's disease (HD) seems not due to reduced movement speed alone but may also be task-dependent. We therefore investigated the influence of visual control on the ability of HD patients to perform a motor task. Ten HD patients, never treated with neuroleptic drugs and with mild functional impairment in activities of daily living, performed the task blindfolded and not blindfolded, as did 10 age- and education-matched healthy controls. The task was to use the dominant hand to trace out the contours of a 20 x 20 cm square in a clockwise direction, pausing at each corner. The square was marked on the table at which the subject sat. Accuracy was stressed rather than speed. A videocamerabased system recorded movement trajectories, from which kinematic and error parameters were derived. Patients and controls moved at comparable speeds but patients took longer to complete the task due to more curvilinear and hence longer trajectories. Patients spent more time in the deceleration phase of the movement, and in the blindfold condition had more variable movements as indicated by greater error variability scores. Correlation analysis showed that kinematic parameters in patients did not correlate with involuntary movement scores. These findings indicate that abnormalities of motor control are present in HD when movement accuracy (and not velocity) is required. HD patients are more dependent on visual control than normal subjects.
8871976	Narcolepsy.	Narcolepsy is among the leading causes of excessive daytime sleepiness and is the most common neurologic cause. Its classic form--narcolepsy with cataplexy--is a distinct neurologic disease with characteristic clinical and paraclinical findings. The history, epidemiology, clinical picture, pathophysiology, cause, diagnosis, and treatment, both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic, are discussed in detail.
10458611	The sleep disorder canine narcolepsy is caused by a mutation in the hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2 gene.	Narcolepsy is a disabling sleep disorder affecting humans and animals. It is characterized by daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and striking transitions from wakefulness into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In this study, we used positional cloning to identify an autosomal recessive mutation responsible for this sleep disorder in a well-established canine model. We have determined that canine narcolepsy is caused by disruption of the hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2 gene (Hcrtr2). This result identifies hypocretins as major sleep-modulating neurotransmitters and opens novel potential therapeutic approaches for narcoleptic patients.
10583376	Solution structure of a new hypothalamic neuropeptide, human hypocretin-2/orexin-B.	Orexin-A and orexin-B (also called hypocretin-1 and hypocretin-2, respectively) are novel hypothalamic neuropeptides encoded by a single mRNA transcript; they stimulate food intake. We have determined the three-dimensional solution structure of human hypocretin-2/orexin-B using two-dimensional 1H-NMR data and dynamical simulated annealing calculations. On the basis of NOEs, 3JHNalpha coupling constants and hydrogen-deuterium exchange rates together with chemical shift indices, human hypocretin-2/orexin-B was deduced to consist of two alpha-helices connected with a short linker in both H2O and 30% trifluoroethanol solutions. The helical axis of helix I is oriented about 60-80 degrees relative to helix II. Hybrid distance geometry and simulated-annealing protocols were used to generate an ensemble of 30 structures with no constraint violations greater than 0.03 nm for distances and 3 degrees for angles. In addition, human hypocretin-2/orexin-B shares a similar secondary-structural motif with human neuropeptide Y. This result can form the basis for further study on ligand-receptor recognition of human orexin receptors.
10906799	The hypocretin/orexin ligand-receptor system: implications for sleep and sleep disorders.	The molecules originally described as the hypocretins and subsequently as the orexins were initially implicated in the control of food intake. Recent observations implicate this newly-described neurotransmitter system in the sleep disorder narcolepsy and, potentially, in the regulation of normal sleep processes. This article reviews the research that led to the isolation of the hypocretin/orexin peptides, their receptors and the activity of these molecules as we currently understand them. A model is proposed in which the cells that make these peptides might be involved in arousal state control.
11020209	The hypocretins: excitatory neuromodulatory peptides for multiple homeostatic systems, including sleep and feeding.	The hypocretins are two neuropeptides of related sequence that are produced from a common precursor whose expression is restricted to 1, 100 large neurons of the rat dorsal-lateral hypothalamus. The hypocretins have been detected immunohistochemically in secretory vesicles at synapses of fibers that project to areas within the posterior hypothalamus that are implicated in feeding behaviors and hormone secretion and diverse targets in other brain regions and in the spinal cord, including several areas implicated in cardiovascular function and sleep-wake regulation. The hypocretin-producing cells have receptors for leptin and receive input from arcuate neuropeptide Y neurons. The peptides are excitatory when applied to cultured hypothalamic, cortical, or spinal cord neurons. Two G protein-coupled receptors for the hypocretins have been identified, and these have different distributions within the CNS and differential affinities for the two hypocretins. Administration of the hypocretins stimulates food intake; affects blood pressure, hormone secretion, and locomotor activity; and increases wakefulness while suppressing REM sleep. The hypocretin mRNA accumulates during food deprivation. An inactivating insertion into the hypocretin receptor 2 gene in dogs results in narcolepsy. Mice whose hypocretin gene has been inactivated exhibit a narcolepsy-like phenotype. Human patients with narcolepsy have greatly reduced levels of hypocretin peptides in their cerebral spinal fluid. One aspect of hypocretin activity is the direct excitation of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus to prevent entry into REM sleep. These peptides appear to be part of a complex circuit that integrates aspects of energy metabolism, cardiovascular function, hormone homeostasis, and sleep-wake behaviors.
11431960	[Involvement of orexins/hypocretins in multiple physiological functions].	Orexins (orexin-A and orexin-B)/hipocretins (hypocretin-1 and hypocretin-2) are novel neuropetides discovered in 1998. Orexin-producing neurons are exclusively distributed in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), the posterior hypothalamic area and the perifornical nucleus in rats. The LHA is known to be a feeding center in the hypothalamus. Central administration of orexins stimulated feeding in rats and mice. Therefore, orexins are recognized as potent orexigenic peptides. In a positional cloning study, genetically narcoleptic dogs had a deletion of the orexin receptor 2 gene, resulting in a truncated, nonfunctional receptor. Orexin knockout mice were found to exhibit narcoleptic behavior. In human narcoleptic patients, hypocretin-1 in cerebrospinal fluid was undetectable in almost all patients with narcolepsy. Although the physiological role of feeding seems to be independent of sleep, it is very interesting that orexins may be common bioactive substances that are involved in regulating feeding and sleep. The discovery of orexins may contribute to clarify the pathogenesis of disorders in feeding and sleep and to develop drugs for those disorders.
11442359	Hypocretin levels in sporadic and familial cases of canine narcolepsy.	Familial and sporadic forms of narcolepsy exist in both humans and canines. Mutations in the hypocretin receptor 2 gene (Hcrtr 2) cause canine familial narcolepsy. In humans, mutations in hypocretin-related genes are rare, but cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 is undetectable in most sporadic cases. Using the canine model, we investigated ( 1 ) whether hypocretin deficiency is involved in sporadic cases and ( 2 ) whether alterations in hypocretin neurons or ligand levels also contribute to the phenotype in Hcrtr 2 mutants. We found that hypocretins were undetectable in the brains of three of three and the CSF of two of two sporadic narcoleptic dogs tested. In contrast, hypocretin levels were not altered in brains and CSF of genetically narcoleptic Dobermans, and hypocretin-containing neurons were of normal appearance. Therefore, multiple hypocretin-related etiologies are likely to be involved in canine narcolepsy. The presence of hypocretin peptides in Hcrtr 2-mutated animals suggests that neurotransmission through Hcrtr 1 may be intact, arguing for a preferential importance of Hcrtr 2-mediated function in narcolepsy.
11924049	[Genetics of human narcolepsy].	Narcolepsy is known to be a complex disorder; both genetic and environmental factors play a role in its pathophysiology. Although narcolepsy presents one of the tightest association with a specific HLA antigen (DQB1*0602), there is strong evidence that non-HLA genes also confer susceptibility, both monoaminergic and hypocretinergic systems seem to be involved and may interfere with the phenotype. Implication of the hypocretin system is well-established in both canine and murine narcolepsy (caused by mutation) and a consistent reduction in hypocretin neuron seems to be the cause of human narcolepsy. An autoimmune process is probable.
12052911	The role of hypocretins (orexins) in sleep regulation and narcolepsy.	The hypocretins (orexins) are two novel neuropeptides (Hcrt-1 and Hcrt-2), derived from the same precursor gene, that are synthesized by neurons located exclusively in the lateral, posterior, and perifornical hypothalamus. Hypocretin-containing neurons have widespread projections throughout the CNS with particularly dense excitatory projections to monoaminergic centers such as the noradrenergic locus coeruleus, histaminergic tuberomammillary nucleus, serotoninergic raphe nucleus, and dopaminergic ventral tegmental area. The hypocretins were originally believed to be primarily important in the regulation of appetite; however, a major function emerging from research on these neuropeptides is the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. Deficiency in hypocretin neurotransmission results in the sleep disorder narcolepsy in mice, dogs, and humans. The hypocretins are also uniquely positioned to link sleep, appetite, and neuroendocrine control. The aim of this review is to describe and discuss the current knowledge regarding the hypocretin neurotransmitter system in narcolepsy and normal sleep.
12359500	Hypocretins/orexins as integrators of physiological information: lessons from mutant animals.	The hypocretins/orexins (hcrts) are two recently described neuropeptides derived from the same precursor and expressed in a few thousand neurons in the perifornical area of the lateral hypothalamus, which project throughout the brain. The hypocretins bind to two G-protein coupled receptors with different selective affinities. Positional cloning of the gene responsible for a canine model of narcolepsy revealed that this disease is caused by mutations in hypocretin receptor type 2. Parallel studies with hypocretin/orexin knockout mice showed behavioral arrests reminiscent of narcolepsy-like attacks. Narcoleptic patients have decreased hypocretin-containing neurons suggesting that narcolepsy in humans is caused by selective neurodegeneration of hypocretinergic neurons. Additional functions for the hypocretins on regulation of energy balance neuroendocrine release and sympathetic outflow have been described. Here we review studies in humans and mutant animals that have provided clues about the functions of the hypocretinergic system, which appear to involve the coherent regulation of networks that dictate the states of arousal.
12749547	Decreased hypocretin-1 (Orexin-A) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with myotonic dystrophy and excessive daytime sleepiness.	STUDY OBJECTIVE: Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is a multisystem disorder with myotonia, muscle weakness, cataracts, endocrine dysfunction, and intellectual impairment. This disorder is caused by a CTG triplet expansion in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene on 19q13. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is frequently associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, sharing with narcolepsy a short sleep latency and the presence of sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods during the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. Since narcolepsy is characterized by a dysfunction of the hypothalamic hypocretin system, we investigated whether patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 with excessive daytime sleepiness have abnormalities in the hypocretin system. DESIGN/PARTICIPANTS: Six patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 complaining of excessive daytime sleepiness and 13 healthy controls without a sleep disorder were included. The patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 were evaluated using clinical interviews, nocturnal polysomnograms, and Multiple Sleep Latency Tests. All patients had a confirmed genetic diagnosis for DM1 and were HLA typed. Cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels were measured using a direct radioimmunoassay in patients and controls. SETTING: University hospital sleep laboratory. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: The mean sleep latency on Multiple Sleep Latency Tests was abnormal in all patients (< 5 minutes in 2, < or = 8 in 4) and 2 sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods were observed in 2 subjects. All patients were HLA-DQB1*0602 negative. Hypocretin-1 levels were significantly lower in patients versus controls (p < 0.001); 1 case with 2 sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods had hypocretin-1 levels in the range generally observed in narcolepsy (< 110 pg/mL). Three cases had intermediate levels (110-200 pg/mL). Hypocretin-1 levels did not correlate clinically with disease severity or duration or with subjective or objective sleepiness reports. CONCLUSIONS: A dysfunction of the hypothalamic hypocretin system may mediate sleepiness and abnormal Multiple Sleep Latency Test results in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1.
12797957	Distinct narcolepsy syndromes in Orexin receptor-2 and Orexin null mice: molecular genetic dissection of Non-REM and REM sleep regulatory processes.	"Narcolepsy-cataplexy, a neurological disorder associated with the absence of hypothalamic orexin (hypocretin) neuropeptides, consists of two underlying problems: inability to maintain wakefulness and intrusion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep into wakefulness. Here we document, using behavioral, electrophysiological, and pharmacological criteria, two distinct classes of behavioral arrests exhibited by mice deficient in orexin-mediated signaling. Both OX2R(-/-) and orexin(-/-) mice are similarly affected with behaviorally abnormal attacks of non-REM sleep (""sleep attacks"") and show similar degrees of disrupted wakefulness. In contrast, OX2R(-/-) mice are only mildly affected with cataplexy-like attacks of REM sleep, whereas orexin(-/-) mice are severely affected. Absence of OX2Rs eliminates orexin-evoked excitation of histaminergic neurons in the hypothalamus, which gate non-REM sleep onset. While normal regulation of wake/non-REM sleep transitions depends critically upon OX2R activation, the profound dysregulation of REM sleep control unique to the narcolepsy-cataplexy syndrome emerges from loss of signaling through both OX2R-dependent and OX2R-independent pathways."
12873798	Diurnal variation of cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 (Orexin-A) levels in control and depressed subjects.	BACKGROUND: Hypocretins, excitatory neuropeptides at monoaminergic synapses, appear to regulate human sleep-wake cycles. Undetectable cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels are seen in narcolepsy, which is frequently associated with secondary depression. Shortened rapid eye movement latency is observed in both narcolepsy and depression. Cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels have not been reported in mood disorders. METHODS: We examined hypocretin-1 levels in 14 control and 15 depressed subjects. Cerebrospinal fluid was drawn continuously in supine subjects for 24 hours with an indwelling intrathecal catheter under entrained light-dark conditions. Depressed subjects were studied before and after 5 weeks of sertraline (n=10, three nonresponders) or bupropion (n=5, two nonresponders). RESULTS: Hypocretin-1 levels varied slightly (amplitude 10%) but significantly across the diurnal cycle in control subjects, with amplitude significantly reduced in depression (3%). Levels were lowest at midday, surprising for a hypothetically wake-promoting peptide. Mean hypocretin levels trended higher in depressive than in control subjects. Hypocretin-1 levels decreased modestly but significantly after sertraline (-14%) but not bupropion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with previous physiologic findings in depression indicating dampened diurnal variations in hypocretin-1. The finding that sertraline but not bupropion slightly decreased cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 indicates a serotoninergic influence on hypocretin tone.
10615891	Hypocretin (orexin) deficiency in human narcolepsy.	Alterations in the hypocretin receptor 2 and preprohypocretin genes produce narcolepsy in animal models. Hypocretin was undetectable in seven out of nine people with narcolepsy, indicating abnormal hypocretin transmission.
11282968	Identification and functional analysis of mutations in the hypocretin (orexin) genes of narcoleptic canines.	Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder affecting animals and humans. Exon skipping mutations of the Hypocretin/Orexin-receptor-2 (Hcrtr2) gene were identified as the cause of narcolepsy in Dobermans and Labradors. Preprohypocretin (Hcrt) knockout mice have symptoms similar to human and canine narcolepsy. In this study, 11 sporadic cases of canine narcolepsy and two additional multiplex families were investigated for possible Hcrt and Hcrtr2 mutations. Sporadic cases have been shown to have more variable disease onset, increased disease severity, and undetectable Hypocretin-1 levels in cerebrospinal fluid. The canine Hcrt locus was isolated and characterized for this project. Only one novel mutation was identified in these two loci. This alteration results in a single amino acid substitution (E54K) in the N-terminal region of the Hcrtr2 receptor and autosomal recessive transmission in a Dachshund family. Functional analysis of previously-described exon-skipping mutations and of the E54K substitution were also performed using HEK-293 cell lines transfected with wild-type and mutated constructs. Results indicate a truncated Hcrtr2 protein, an absence of proper membrane localization, and undetectable binding and signal transduction for exon-skipping mutated constructs. In contrast, the E54K abnormality was associated with proper membrane localization, loss of ligand binding, and dramatically diminished calcium mobilization on activation of the receptor. These results are consistent with a loss of function for all three mutations. The absence of mutation in sporadic cases also indicates genetic heterogeneity in canine narcolepsy, as reported previously in humans.
11760460	[MSLT: an objective method of assessment of excessive sleepiness].	Excessive daytime sleepiness is a serious medical problem. It appears against patient will, when he performs normal day activities. It significantly disturbes daily functioning and may be a cause of a serious accidents. Approximately 5% of the general population suffers from excessive daytime sleepiness. The most common cause of daytime sleepiness is sleep deprivation. It is also a symptom of many disorders and may be an effect of taking many drugs, especially sedative ones. Investigation continued in the seventies by W. Dement and M. Carscadon resulted in preparation of MSLT which became the most widely used, objective method of the assessment of excessive sleepiness. It has been quickly used in diagnosis of narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, idiopathic hypersomnia, periodic limb movements, circadian rhythms disorders, insomnia investigations, clinical assessment of many drugs. However equipment requirements are not that complicated, but investigator knowledge and experience are the limitations of the method. We described the protocol of the test including EEG procedures, patient preparation, interpretation of the results and normal values. Indications for MSLT in the diagnosis of sleep disorders were outlined with the special emphasis on narcolepsy.
12049942	Sleep, feeding, and neuropeptides: roles of orexins and orexin receptors.	Recent studies using molecular genetics in mice and dogs, as well as histopathological analyses of human disease, have come to the same conclusion: the human sleep disorder narcolepsy is caused by failure of signaling mediated by orexin (hypocretin) neuropeptides. These and other findings strongly suggest that the orexin system plays a critical role in sleep/wake regulation. In addition, the orexin system may link energy homeostasis to the regulation of sleep/wake cycles.
12405606	Search for neuron-specific and nonneuron-specific antibodies in narcoleptic patients with and without HLA DQB1*0602.	STUDY OBJECTIVES: Narcolepsy is strongly associated with the presence of HLA DQB1*0602. This and other evidence suggests that human narcolepsy is an autoimmune disease. This is in distinction to that found in canine models where hypocretin receptor 2 mutations are etiologic. We decided to test for the presence of several neuron-specific and organ-specific autoantibodies to see if they were present in HLA DQB1*0602-associated or cataplexy-associated narcolepsy or could serve as a serologic marker of the illness. DESIGN: We tested for N-type and P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium-channel antibodies, neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha3 subunit, acetylcholine receptor-binding antibodies, striated muscle antibodies, Type 1 Purkinje cell cytoplasmic antibodies, types 1 and 2 antineuronal nuclear antibodies and amphiphysin antibodies, GAD-65 antibody, and thyroid microsomal and thyroglobulin antibodies in the serum of 43 patients with or without cataplexy, 41 with known HLA status. SETTING: Narcoleptic subjects were recruited from the Mayo Sleep Disorders Center. PARTICIPANTS: N/A. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: No antibody test yielded significantly positive results for the group as a whole or for subgroups of patients with cataplexy or positive HLA DQB1*0602 status. CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support the hypothesis that narcolepsy is an autoimmune disease. However, it is possible that the autoimmune attack is very selective and does not involve the epitopes measured in this study. Recent findings that the hypocretin neurotransmission system is involved in animal models of narcolepsy should lead to research to look for antibodies directed against components of the hypocretin neurotransmission system in narcolepsy.
12792667	Involvement of hypocretins/orexins in sleep disorders and narcolepsy.	The orexins/hypocretins are novel peptide neurotransmitters first characterized in 1998. The cell bodies of the neurons releasing them are localized exclusively in the posterior and lateral hypothalamus although they send out projections which innervate the whole central nervous system. They have recently attracted a great deal of interest in the neuroscience and medical community due to the finding that a reduction of orexin/hypocretins levels occurs in most human cases of the sleep disorder narcolepsy. A flurry of recent experimental data has begun to shed light on the normal physiological functioning of this system and how its loss leads to narcolepsy. Preliminary findings also indicate that it may malfunction in a variety of other conditions where the normal sleep-wake cycle is compromised.
9484372	Presentation of narcolepsy after 40.	To advance understanding of the clinical spectra of narcolepsy, we retrospectively reviewed the histories and clinical and polysomnographic features of 41 consecutive patients in whom this diagnosis was established in our center over 3 years. A total of 51% presented after the age of 40 years. Among the older patients, three subpopulations were noted: 1) narcolepsy/cataplexy with presentation delayed because of mild disease severity or misdiagnosis; 2) narcolepsy/cataplexy with diagnosis delayed until late-life expression of cataplexy; and 3) narcolepsy lacking cataplexy with later-life onset of excessive daytime sleepiness. Clinical, polysomnographic, and multiple sleep latency test assessments of rapid eye movement sleep dyscontrol and sleepiness were unrelated to age. This analysis identified older patients lacking cataplexy as the least severely affected narcoleptic subgroup. Narcolepsy, a continuum of phenotypes and severities that masks its recognition, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of sleepiness or transient loss of muscle tone in older patients.
10505821	Health-related quality of life effects of modafinil for treatment of narcolepsy.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the burden of illness of narcolepsy and assess the health-related quality-of-life (HQL) effects of oral modafinil, a wake-promoting therapy for excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. METHODS: Subjects with narcolepsy enrolled in a nine-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind study and were randomized to placebo, modafinil 200 mg, or modafinil 400 mg. After the study, consenting subjects received modafinil in a 40-week open-label extension. A self-administered HQL questionnaire consisting of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and supplemental narcolepsy-specific scales was given to subjects at baseline, study endpoint, and several open-label timepoints. RESULTS: 481 subjects completed a baseline and double-blind endpoint HQL assessment. Compared to population norms, baseline HQL scores reflected substantial burden in vitality, social functioning, and performing usual activities. At study endpoint, subjects in the 400 mg modafinil group had significantly higher scores than placebo for 10 of the 17 HQL scales. The 400 mg modafinil group had more energy, fewer difficulties performing usual activities, fewer interferences with social activities, improved psychological well-being and higher productivity, attention and self-esteem compared to placebo subjects (p<.05). The positive treatment effects were sustained over the open-label extension. CONCLUSION: Modafinil significantly improves health-related quality of life in narcolepsy.
11027918	Sulpiride, a D2/D3 blocker, reduces cataplexy but not REM sleep in canine narcolepsy.	Cataplexy, an abnormal manifestation of REM sleep atonia, is currently treated with antidepressants. These medications also reduce physiological REM sleep and induce nocturnal sleep disturbances. Because a recent work on canine narcolepsy suggests that the mechanisms for triggering cataplexy are different from those for REM sleep, we hypothesized that compounds which act specifically on cataplexy, but not on REM sleep, could be developed. Canine studies also suggest that the dopamine D2/D3 receptor mechanism is specifically involved in the regulation of cataplexy, but little evidence suggests that this mechanism is important for REM sleep regulation. We therefore assessed the effects of sulpiride, a commonly used D2/D3 antagonist, on cataplexy and sleep in narcoleptic canines to explore the possible clinical application of D2/D3 antagonists for the treatment of human narcolepsy. Both acute and chronic oral administration of sulpiride (300 mg/dog, 600 mg/dog) significantly reduced cataplexy without noticeable side effects. Interestingly, the anticataplectic dose of sulpiride did not significantly reduce the amount of REM sleep. Sulpiride (and other D2/D3 antagonists) may therefore be an attractive new therapeutic indication in human narcolepsy.
11344826	The role of the hypothalamic neuropeptides hypocretin/orexin in the sleep-wake cycle.	The novel neuropeptides hypocretin/orexin have recently been located on the lateral hypothalamus cells. This system has been linked to the regulation of both feeding and sleep, and recent studies have found an association between a defect in these neuropeptides and narcolepsy. We conducted a MEDLINE review of all the articles published since the discovery of hypocretin/orexin peptides, narrowing the field to the relationship between these neuropeptides and sleep. The finding of a deletion in the transcription of the hypocretin receptor 2 gene in narcoleptic Doberman pinschers and the development of a knockout of the hypocretin gene in mice pointed to the relevance of this system in the sleep-wake cycle. We provide further evidence of the role of the hypocretin/orexin system in narcolepsy and in sleep regulation and present an integrative model of the pathophysiology of narcolepsy. The discovery of the link between these peptides and narcolepsy opens new avenues to both the understanding of sleep mechanisms and therapeutic implications for sleep disorders.
11350122	Physical and radiation hybrid mapping of canine chromosome 12, in a region corresponding to human chromosome 6p12-q12.	The positional cloning of the hypocretin receptor 2, the gene for autosomal recessive canine narcolepsy, has led to the development of a physical map spanning a large portion of canine chromosome 12 (CFA12), in a region corresponding to human chromosome 6p12-q13. More than 40 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were used in homology search experiments, together with chromosome walking, to build both physical and radiation hybrid maps of the CFA12 13-21 region. The resulting map of bacterial artificial chromosome ends, ESTs, and microsatellite markers represents the longest continuous high-density map of the dog genome reported to date. These data further establish the dog as a system for studying disease genes of interest to human populations and highlight feasible approaches for positional cloning of disease genes in organisms where genomic resources are limited.
11549737	Hypocretin-2-saporin lesions of the lateral hypothalamus produce narcoleptic-like sleep behavior in the rat.	Hypocretins (Hcrts) are recently discovered peptides linked to the human sleep disorder narcolepsy. Humans with narcolepsy have decreased numbers of Hcrt neurons and Hcrt-null mice also have narcoleptic symptoms. Hcrt neurons are located only in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) but neither electrolytic nor pharmacological lesions of this or any other brain region have produced narcoleptic-like sleep, suggesting that specific neurons need to be destroyed. Hcrt neurons express the Hcrt receptor, and to facilitate lesioning these neurons, the endogenous ligand hypocretin-2/orexin B (Hcrt2) was conjugated to the ribosome-inactivating protein saporin (SAP). In vitro binding studies indicated specificity of the Hcrt2-SAP because it preferentially bound to Chinese hamster ovary cells containing the Hcrt/orexin receptor 2 (HcrtR2/OX(2)R) or the Hcrt/orexin receptor 1 (HcrtR1/OX(1)R) but not to Kirsten murine sarcoma virus transformed rat kidney epithelial (KNRK) cells stably transfected with the substance P (neurokinin-1) receptor. Administration of the toxin to the LH, in which the receptor is known to be present, eliminated some neurons (Hcrt, melanin-concentrating hormone, and adenosine deaminase-containing neurons) but not others (a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone), indicating specificity of the toxin in vivo. When the toxin was administered to the LH, rats had increased slow-wave sleep, rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep, and sleep-onset REM sleep periods. These behavioral changes were negatively correlated with the loss of Hcrt-containing neurons but not with the loss of adenosine deaminase-immunoreactive neurons. These findings indicate that damage to the LH that also causes a substantial loss of Hcrt neurons is likely to produce the multiple sleep disturbances that occur in narcolepsy.
11712279	Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery. Surgical treatment by ostial occlusion through pulmonary arteriotomy.	Two cases of anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery are reported in asymptomatic patients 15 and 27 years of age, bringing to 30 the total number of cases of this anomaly reported in the postinfantile age group. ECG exercise tests demonstrated marked ischemic changes in both patients, but angina or abnormal shortness of breath did not develop in either patient during or after exercise. The anomalous vessel was interrupted by closure of its ostium through a pulmonary arteriotomy during cardiopulmonary bypass, a procedure felt to offer a distinct technical advantage in the surgical treatment of this condition. Following ligation of the anomalous vessel, ECG exercise tests no longer showed definitive evidence of myocardial ischemia. This is interpreted as evidence that ligation should reduce the incidence of exercise-induced sudden deaths in this anomaly.
12056812	Hypocretin stimulates [(35)S]GTP gamma S binding in Hcrtr 2-transfected cell lines and in brain homogenate.	In vitro functional analyses of hypocretin/orexin receptor systems were performed using [(125)I]hypocretin radioreceptor and hypocretin-stimulated [(35)S]GTP gamma S binding assay in cell lines expressing human or canine (wild-type and narcoleptic-mutation) hypocretin receptor 2 (Hcrtr 2). Hypocretin-2 stimulated [(35)S]GTP gamma S binding in human and canine Hcrtr 2 expressing cell lines, while cell lines expressing the mutated canine Hcrtr 2 did not exhibit specific binding for [(125)I]hypocretin or hypocretin-stimulated [(35)S]GTP gamma S. In rat brain homogenates, regional specific hypocretin-stimulated [(35)S]GTP gamma S binding was also observed. Hypocretin-stimulated [(35)S]GTP gamma S binding, may thus be a useful functional assay for hypocretin receptors in both cell lines and brain tissue homogenates.
12535700	Measurement of hypocretin/orexin content in the mouse brain using an enzyme immunoassay: the effect of circadian time, age and genetic background.	The hypocretins (1 and 2) have emerged as key regulators of sleep and wakefulness. We developed a high-throughput enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to measure total brain hypocretin levels from large numbers of mice. Hypocretin levels were not altered by circadian time or age. However, significant differences in one or both hypocretin peptides were observed between different mouse strains. We studied hypocretin levels in knockout and transgenic mouse models with obesity, circadian gene mutations or monoaminergic defects. Compared to controls, only histamine receptor knockouts had lower hypocretin levels. This was most pronounced in H1 receptor knockouts suggesting the existence of a positive feedback loop between hypocretin and histaminergic neurons.
8187437	Clinical screening for narcolepsy/cataplexy in patients with fibromyalgia.	We report two cases of fibromyalgia occurring during the course of a long-standing narcolepsy/cataplexy. This association is probably not fortuitous and we propose an easy clinical procedure to search for narcolepsy/cataplexy in these patients. Narcolepsy/cataplexy is a treatable condition requiring drugs that in turn may improve in the long-term symptoms of fibromyalgia.
10419584	Narcolepsy and other causes of excessive daytime sleepiness.	Narcolepsy is a chronic disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and other auxiliary symptoms. An interview can ascertain specific symptomatology, whereas a polysomnogram can reveal distinct clinical features. The clinical and laboratory evaluation together enable an accurate diagnosis of narcolepsy. This diagnosis includes a wide spectrum of symptom combinations. Treatment of narcolepsy should include the empathic guidance of a sleep clinician, an emphasis on sleep hygiene, and in many cases pharmacotherapy.
10973318	A mutation in a case of early onset narcolepsy and a generalized absence of hypocretin peptides in human narcoleptic brains.	We explored the role of hypocretins in human narcolepsy through histopathology of six narcolepsy brains and mutation screening of Hcrt, Hcrtr1 and Hcrtr2 in 74 patients of various human leukocyte antigen and family history status. One Hcrt mutation, impairing peptide trafficking and processing, was found in a single case with early onset narcolepsy. In situ hybridization of the perifornical area and peptide radioimmunoassays indicated global loss of hypocretins, without gliosis or signs of inflammation in all human cases examined. Although hypocretin loci do not contribute significantly to genetic predisposition, most cases of human narcolepsy are associated with a deficient hypocretin system.
11435802	Narcolepsy: clinical features, new pathophysiologic insights, and future perspectives.	Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and abnormal manifestations of rapid eye movement sleep such as cataplexy. The authors review the clinical features of narcolepsy, including epidemiology, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment, in detail. Recent findings show that a loss of hypocretin-producing neurons lies at the root of the signs and symptoms of narcolepsy. The authors review the current state of knowledge on hypocretin anatomy, physiology, and function with special emphasis on the research regarding the hypocretin deficiency in narcolepsy, which may also explain associated features of the disorder, such as obesity. Lastly, they discuss some future perspectives for research into the pathophysiology of sleep/wake disorders, and the potential impact of the established hypocretin deficiency on the diagnosis and treatment of narcolepsy.
11712293	"An appraisal of ""supernormal"" A-V conduction."	"Certain temporal patterns of A-V and V-A transmission in experimental preparations resemble phenomena attributed to ""supernormal"" conduction in the clinic. Detailed study of the properties of the A-V transmission system in such experiments reveals alternative explanations in which supernormality is clearly eliminated. By application of similar principles, supernormality can be eliminated as a factor in most if not all of the published examples. Three major categories can be discerned: (1) occult 2:1 A-V block, in which an idioventricular beat ""retracts"" an otherwise refractory barrier within the A-V node; (2) alternation between dissociated intranodal transmission pathways; and (3) ""ventriculophasic"" (vagal) depression of nodal conductivity."
12403989	Sleeping with the hypothalamus: emerging therapeutic targets for sleep disorders.	Delineating the basic mechanisms that regulate sleep will likely result in the development of better treatments for sleep disorders. The hypothalamus is now recognized as a key center for sleep regulation, with hypothalamic neurotransmitter systems providing the framework for therapeutic advances. An increased awareness of the close interaction between sleep and homeostatic systems is also emerging. Progress has occurred in the understanding of narcolepsy--molecular techniques have identified the lateral hypothalamic hypocretin (orexin) neuropeptide system as key to the disorder. Other sleep disorders are now being tackled in the same way and are likely to yield to efforts combining basic and clinical research. Here we highlight the role of the hypothalamus in sleep physiology and discuss neurotransmitter systems, such as adenosine, dopamine, GABA, histamine and hypocretin, that may have therapeutic applications for sleep disorders.
12849457	The genetics of sleep disorders.	The contribution of genetic components to the pathology of sleep disorders is increasingly recognised as important. Genetic studies have identified genes that may be important in the regulation of circadian rhythms, which in turn determine the time of sleep onset and waking. Recent studies have shown that mutations in hPER2 are associated with autosomal-dominant familial advanced-sleep-phase syndrome. Genetic studies in a canine model of narcolepsy and in knock-out mice have led to the identification of the hypothalamic hypocretin (orexin) neurotransmitter system as a key target for human narcolepsy. The contribution of genetic factors to obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) has led to a better understanding of this complex disorder that may be part of a larger syndrome associated with respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic dysfunction. The aim of this review is to discuss the current knowledge on the role of genetic factors in sleep disorders, in particular circadian disorders, narcolepsy, restless-legs syndrome, and OSAS.
10516803	Pseudo-narcolepsy: case report.	"This report describes the case of a 44-year-old woman presenting to a Sleep and Alertness clinic with symptoms of narcolepsy. The patient had clinical and polysomnographic features of narcolepsy, which disappeared after disclosure of severe psychological stress. Following a discussion of the differential diagnosis of narcolepsy, alternative diagnoses are considered. The authors suggest that the patient had a hysterical conversion disorder, or ""pseudo-narcolepsy."" Careful inquiry into psychological factors in unusual cases of narcolepsy may be warranted."
11799690	Acid-base relationships in the blood of the toad, Bufo marinus. II. The effects of dehydration.	Cutaneous CO2 excretion is reduced as the skin dries during dehydration but an increase in breath frequency acts to regulate the arterial blood PCO2 and thus pHa. Moreover, the toad does not urinate and water is reabsorbed from the bladder to replace that lost by evaporation at the skin and lung surfaces. The animal does, however, produce a very acid bladder urine to conserve circulating levels of plasma [HCO3-] and this together with an increased ventilation effectively maintains the blood acid-base status for up to 48 h of dehydration in air. Water loss and acid production are presumably also reduced by the animal's behaviour; animals remain still, in a crouched position or in a pile if left in groups. Dehydrated toads are less able than hydrated toads to regulate blood pH during hypercapnia: they hyperventilate and mobilize body bicarbonate stores in much the same fashion as hydrated animals but due to the restrictions on cutaneous CO2 excretion and renal output, there is comparatively little reduction in the PCO2 difference between arterial blood and inspired gas thereby resulting in a more severe respiratory acidosis. These factors further contribute to the persistent acidosis which continues even when the animals are returned to air.
11923451	Direct and indirect excitation of laterodorsal tegmental neurons by Hypocretin/Orexin peptides: implications for wakefulness and narcolepsy.	Compelling evidence links the recently discovered hypothalamic peptides Hypocretin/Orexin (Hcrt/Orx) to rapid eye movement sleep (REM) control and the sleep disorder narcolepsy, yet how they influence sleep-related systems is not well understood. We investigated the action of Hcrt/Orx on mesopontine cholinergic (MPCh) neurons of the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT), a target group whose function is altered in canine narcolepsy and appears pivotal for normal REM and wakefulness. Extracellular recordings from mouse brainstem slices revealed that Hcrt/Orx evoked prolonged firing of LDT neurons. Whole-cell recordings revealed that Hcrt/Orx had actions on both presynaptic neurons and at postsynaptic sites. Hcrt/Orx produced an increase in frequency and amplitude of spontaneous EPSCs without equivalent effect on IPSCs, by triggering action potentials and enhancing spike-evoked synaptic transmission in glutamatergic afferents. Postsynaptically, Hcrt/Orx produced an inward current and an increase in membrane current noise, which were accompanied by a conductance increase. These persisted in TTX, ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists, and low extracellular calcium. Both presynaptic and postsynaptic actions were specific because they were not mimicked by an Hcrt/Orx fragment, and both actions were observed for cholinergic and noncholinergic LDT neurons. Finally, extracellular recordings during postsynaptic potential blockade demonstrated that postsynaptic actions of Hcrt/Orx alone could evoke prolonged firing. In the context of other recent work, our findings suggest that Hcrt/Orx neurons may coordinate the activity of the entire reticular activating system during waking. Moreover, these findings address specific hypotheses regarding the cellular mechanisms underlying REM disregulation in narcolepsy.
12613659	Orexins and their receptors: structural aspects and role in peripheral tissues.	Orexins, also named hypocretins, were discovered in 1998 by subtractive cDNA cloning or orphan receptor technologies. Prepro-orexin is enzymatically matured into two peptides, orexin-A and orexin-B which are 33- and 28-amino-acid peptides, respectively. Two cloned orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R are serpentine G-protein-coupled receptors, both of which bind orexins and are coupled to Ca2+ mobilization. Orexins are neuropeptides present in hypothalamic neurons that project throughout the central nervous system to nuclei involved in the control of feeding, sleep-wakefulness, neuroendocrine homeostasis and autonomic regulation. The interest of investigators in orexins has focused on narcolepsy, since genetic or experimental alterations of the orexin system are associated with this sleep disorder. However, orexins are not restricted to the hypothalamus and together with their receptors they are expressed in peripheral tissues. This new multifaceted aspect of orexin biology is reviewed here in descriptions of (i) the proform, maturation and structure of orexins, (ii) the structure, signal transduction and pharmacology of orexin receptors and (iii) the expression of orexins and orexin receptors as well as their biological role in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, gastrointestinal tract, endocrine pancreas and other peripheral tissues.
12626669	Intravenously administered hypocretin-1 alters brain amino acid release: an in vivo microdialysis study in rats.	We have reported that intravenous administration of hypocretin (Hcrt or orexin) reverses the symptoms of narcolepsy in genetically narcoleptic dogs. We have also reported that the onset of symptoms in canine genetic narcolepsy is accompanied by degenerative changes in forebrain regions, particularly the septal nucleus and amygdala. In the present in vivo microdialysis study we have investigated the effect of intravenous administration of Hcrt-1 (orexin-A) to anaesthetized rats on glutamate and GABA release in the amygdala, a region with moderate Hcrt innervation, and in the cerebellar cortex, a region with sparse or no Hcrt innervation. We found that intravenous Hcrt administration caused a marked (> 60 %) and sustained (> 50 min) increase in glutamate release within the amygdala, but no change in release in the cerebellar cortex. We did not detect a significant change in GABA release. When calcium-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid was used as the microdialysis perfusate, Hcrt-1 no longer produced an increase in glutamate release. Hcrt may act via the calcium-dependent regulation of glutamate release in certain nuclei of the central nervous system.
12946023	Pattern of hypocretin (orexin) soma and axon loss, and gliosis, in human narcolepsy.	Human narcolepsy is correlated with a greatly reduced number of hypocretin (orexin) containing neurons and axons, and an elevated level of hypothalamic gliosis. We now report that the percentage loss of Hcrt cells and percentage elevation of GFAP staining are variable across forebrain and brain-stem nuclei, and are maximal in the posterior and tuberomammillary hypothalamic region. Regional gliosis and percent loss of hypocretin axons in narcoleptics are not correlated with regional hypocretin cell soma density in normals or with regional percent soma loss in narcoleptics. Rather they are independently and strongly correlated with the regional density of hypocretin axons and the message density for hypocretin receptor 2, as quantified in the rat. These results are consistent with the hypotheses that the loss of hypocretin function in narcolepsy results from a cytotoxic or immunologically mediated attack focused on hypocretin receptor 2 or an antigen anatomically linked to hypocretin receptor 2, and that this process is intensified in regions of high axonal density.
10459746	A search for a mutation in the tumour necrosis factor-alpha gene in narcolepsy.	The discovery of almost 100% association of narcolepsy with human leukocyte antigens (HLA) DR2 antigen prompted molecular biological research of this disorder. In the HLA class II gene cluster, the gene for tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which plays a role in the regulation of normal human sleep, is located. The present study searched for a mutation in the TNF-alpha gene by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP) in patients with narcolepsy. No mutation was detected in exons and introns of the TNF-alpha gene by SSCP and sequencing.
11502932	Narcolepsy associated with other central nervous system disorders.	The authors identified patients with the coexistence of narcolepsy and another CNS disorder seen between 1975 and 1998 at their institution. Eighteen patients were identified, nine with narcolepsy commencing within 1 year before or after the other disorder. Seven patients (39%) had hypothalamic-pituitary syndromes. When they occur together, narcolepsy and other CNS disorders frequently emerge at about the same time, suggesting a causative relationship. Hypothalamic-pituitary pathology was the most common association.
11682269	Hypothalamic regulation of sleep.	The recent discovery linking narcolepsy, a sleep disorder characterized by very short REM sleep latency, with a neuropeptide that regulates feeding and energy metabolism, provides a way to understand how several behaviors may be disrupted as a result of a defect in this peptide. In this chapter we review the evidence linking hypocretin and sleep, including our own studies, and propose that a defect in the lateral hypothalamus that also involves the hypocretin neurons is likely to produce a disturbance in sleep, mood, appetite, and rhythms.
11712281	Prognosis for patients with ventricular septal defect and severe pulmonary vascular obstructive disease.	"The status of 58 patients, 3 to 57 years of age, with ventricular septal defect and a marked increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (pulmonary obstructive disease) was determined 5 years or longer after diagnostic catheterization. Forty-six (80%) were alive 5 years after that study. The probability of living 5 years was 95% for patients aged 10 through 19 years and 56% for those 20 years of age or older. The dissimilarity of actuarial curves between these two groups is consistent with the hypothesis that pulmonary vascular obstructive disease develops under age 20. Calculated pulmonary resistance increased with age of patient on admission to the study, suggesting its progressive nature. Hemoptysis was rare under age 20, and its presence over this age indicated a poor prognosis. The most common causes of death were ""sudden"" or ""unknown."" Most surviving patients were gainfully employed or attending school without severe symptoms."
14521484	Pharmacological management of narcolepsy.	Narcolepsy is a disabling disorder characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis and disturbed nocturnal sleep. Traditionally, a wide variety of substances are used in the symptomatic pharmacological treatment of narcolepsy. Several generally more-tolerated substances have been added to the therapeutic repertoire after extensive testing in large patient populations during recent years. This review addresses the state-of-the-art knowledge about the pharmacological treatment of narcolepsy along with the personal view of the authors. The recent discovery that narcolepsy is caused by deficient hypocretin (orexin) transmission opens a perspective on causal therapy.
7481382	[Narcolepsy disclosing neurosarcoidosis].	A 37-year-old man developed excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep attacks and cataplexy revealing an hypothalamic tumour. Multiple Sleep Latency Tests (MSLT) were characteristics of narcolepsy. Tissue typing was positive for HLA DR2 and DQ1. Most cases of narcolepsy are idiopathic without any evidence of brain pathology. Although symptomatic narcolepsy may occur occasionally with diencephalic lesions. The relationship between narcolepsy with diencephalic lesions is unsettled and will be discussed.
11148249	A prepro-orexin gene polymorphism is associated with narcolepsy.	The orexin (hypocretin) neurotransmitter system was recently shown to be directly involved in the pathogenesis of narcolepsy in two animal models. Furthermore, decreased levels of orexin A in the CSF were shown in narcoleptic patients. To define any genetic contribution of orexin to the etiology of narcolepsy, the authors screened the entire prepro-orexin gene for mutations or polymorphisms in 133 patients suffering from narcolepsy. They report an association of a rare polymorphism in the prepro-orexin gene with narcolepsy in a cohort of 178 patients.
11179675	Modulation of the promoter region of prepro-hypocretin by alpha-interferon.	Hypocretins 1 and 2 (also called orexins A and B, respectively) are hypothalamic neuropeptides that have recently been shown to be involved in the sleep disorder narcolepsy and possibly in the normal regulation of sleep and wake functions. These two peptides are derived from a single precursor molecule called prepro-hypocretin, also known as prepro-orexin. We have cloned a 450 bp fragment from the 5'-flanking region of the human prepro-hypocretin gene and demonstrated that this fragment has promoter activity in vitro. Deletions at the 5' end from -450 to -188 reduced the promoter activity by approximately 50%. Further deletion from the 5'-end to -69 almost completely abolished promoter activity. The 450 bp fragment contains a number of potential transcription factor binding sites, including an interferon (IFN) response element. Our studies demonstrate that alpha-IFN strongly inhibits the promoter activity of both 450 and 188 bp fragments in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of alpha-IFN is consistent with recent studies which suggest that hypocretin 1/orexin A may be involved in modulating arousal states and with the literature indicating involvement of immune-related molecules in sleep regulation.
11532254	Effects of hypocretin-saporin injections into the medial septum on sleep and hippocampal theta.	Neurons containing the peptide hypocretin, also known as orexin, were recently implicated in the human sleep disorder narcolepsy. Hypocretin neurons are located only in the lateral hypothalamus from where they innervate virtually the entire brain and spinal cord. This peptide is believed to be involved in regulating feeding and wakefulness. However, to fully understand what other behaviors are regulated by this peptide it is necessary to investigate each hypocretin target site. In the present study, we focus on one hypocretin target site, the medial septum, where there is a dense collection of hypocretin-2 receptor-containing cells, and degenerating axons are present here in canines with narcolepsy [J. Neurosci. 19 (1999) 248]. We utilize a saporin toxin conjugated to the hypocretin receptor binding ligand, hypocretin-2, and find that when this toxin is injected into the medial septum, it lesions the parvalbumin and cholinergic neurons. We contrast the effects of the hypocretin-saporin with another saporin conjugated toxin, 192 IgG-saporin, that lesions only the cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain. 192 IgG-saporin reduced theta activity, a finding consistent with previous reports [J. Neurophysiol. 79 (1998) 1633; Neurodegeneration 4 (1995) 61; Neuroscience 62 (1994) 1033]. However, hypocretin-saporin completely eliminated hippocampal theta activity by day 12, indicating that parvalbumin-containing cells in the medial septum generate theta. The daily amount of sleep and wakefulness were not different between hypocretin-saporin, 192 IgG-saporin, or saline-treated rats. The homeostatic response to 12 h prolonged wakefulness was also not affected in hypocretin-saporin lesioned rats. These findings suggest that hypocretin neurons could facilitate theta generation during episodes of purposeful behavior by activating GABAergic neurons in the MS/VDB. In this way, hypocretin, which is implicated in feeding, energy metabolism and wakefulness, serves to influence cognitive processes critical for the animal's survival.
9458119	Triplet repeat polymorphism within the NOTCH4 gene located near the junction of the HLA class II and class III regions in narcolepsy.	A polymorphic (CTG)n microsatellite repeat was found in the signal peptide domain of the NOTCH4 gene located near the junction of the class II and class III regions of the human major histocompatibility complex. This gene belongs to a multigene family of NOTCH originally identified as a differential factor of neuronal cells. To ascertain whether the NOTCH4 gene is involved in the development of neurogenic disease, narcolepsy, which is known to be tightly associated with HLA-DR15, this microsatellite polymorphism of the (CTG)n repeat was analyzed in Japanese patients with narcolepsy One allele, 9 repetitions of CTG (Leu) was significantly increased in the patient group. However, the significant increase of this allele in the patient group could be explained by a strong linkage disequilibrium with the HLA class II alleles, DRB1*1501, DQA1*0102 and DQB1*0602, which were more strongly associated with the disease. These results suggest that the (CTG)n repeat polymorphism in NOTCH4 does not primarily determine the susceptibility to narcolepsy.
9835938	[Hypersomnia. Narcolepsy-cataplexy (Gélineau syndrome)].	SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS: Narcolepsy is the most prevalent of the primary disorders of vigilance. It is relatively easy to identify in presence of clearcut cataplexy and other REM-sleep related symptoms, i.e. sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations. Otherwise, one must rely on demonstration of sleep onsets in REM during night and daytime polygraphy, and on the very strong association with the HLA gene DQB1*0602. TREATMENT: With the advent of modafinil, treatment of narcolepsy has been substantially modified. New strategies are an improvement over amphetamines both in terms of side effects and long-term outcome. Most cataplectic attacks can be controlled by tricyclics or other antidepressants. PATHOGENESIS: Major advances in pathophysiology and etiology have been obtained through an animal model of the disease, canine narcolepsy. Pharmacological studies point to the importance of alpha-1 adrenergic mechanisms in cataplexy, while dopaminergic systems seem more involved in generating sleepiness. As concerns genetics of this autosomal recessive disease, there is an equivalent of the human HLA association in the form of an immunoglobulin gene (mu-switch) linkage. Narcolepsy research is now looking for other genes, for which familial cases may give clues.
11683899	Fluctuation of extracellular hypocretin-1 (orexin A) levels in the rat in relation to the light-dark cycle and sleep-wake activities.	Hypocretins/orexins are neuropeptides implicated in sleep regulation and the sleep disorder narcolepsy. In order to examine how hypocretin activity fluctuates across 24 h with respect to the sleep-wake cycle, we measured changes in extracellular hypocretin-1 levels in the lateral hypothalamus and medial thalamus of freely moving rats with simultaneous sleep recordings. Hypocretin levels exhibited a robust diurnal fluctuation; levels slowly increased during the dark period (active phase), and decreased during the light period (rest phase). Levels were not correlated with the amount of wake or sleep in each period. Although an acute 4-h light-shift did not alter hypocretin levels, 6-h sleep deprivation significantly increased hypocretin release during the forced-wake period. Hypocretin activity is, thus, likely to build up during wakefulness and decline with the occurrence of sleep. These findings, together with the fact that a difficulty in maintaining wakefulness during the daytime is one of the primary symptoms of hypocretin-deficient narcolepsy, suggest that hypocretin activity may be critical in opposing sleep propensity during periods of prolonged wakefulness.
12405608	Hypocretin (orexin) levels in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with narcolepsy: relationship to cataplexy and HLA DQB1*0602 status.	STUDY OBJECTIVES: Hypocretin (orexin) deficiency (< 40 pg/ml) is highly associated with narcolepsy with cataplexy (89.5%) and more specifically with patients with cataplexy who are HLA DQB1*0602 positive (95.7%). The relationship between hypocretin-1 levels and narcolepsy without cataplexy or the DQB1*0602 allele is less clear. METHODS/DESIGN: This study compared cerebrospinal (CSF) hypocretin-1 in 13 patients with HLA DQB1*0602 allele and cataplexy to 4 HLA negative patients with cataplexy, 3 HLA positive patients without cataplexy, and 6 HLA negative patients without cataplexy, plus 15 neurologic controls. SETTING: Data were collected at a sleep disorders center. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six patients with narcolepsy, with and without HLA DQB1*0602 and with and without cataplexy, as well as 15 neurologic controls. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENT & RESULTS: Using analysis of variance techniques, statistically significant differences were found between the CSF hypocretin-1 levels in HLA positive patients and all other groups (P < 0.01). Although the sample size was small, subjects with the DQB1*0602 allele without cataplexy had lower hypocretin-1 levels than did other groups (other than the HLA and cataplexy positive group). Hypocretin-1 levels were not associated with age at diagnosis, age at lumbar puncture, body mass index at time of diagnosis, or body mass index at time of lumbar puncture. CONCLUSION: This data confirms the previous finding that undetectable hypocretin-1 levels are highly specific for HLA positive narcolepsy with cataplexy. The data suggests that the pathophysiology and, by extension, etiology of this disorder are distinctly different from the other conditions studied. The relationship of the DQB1*0602 allele and reduced hypocretin-1 levels needs further study.
12457441	Novel therapies for narcolepsy.	Narcolepsy is a primary neurological disorder, which often produces disabling symptoms, including excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. Although the precise aetiology of narcolepsy has not been determined, our understanding of the pathophysiology of this complex disorder has grown dramatically during the past several years, especially as it relates to the newly discovered hypocretin system. While symptomatic treatment of narcolepsy is available, the commonly used pharmacological agents are often not completely effective and may be poorly tolerated. The need for new therapeutic tools is, therefore, apparent. This paper explores some exciting new approaches to the treatment of narcolepsy. It is important to emphasise that, although narcolepsy is not a common disorder, new agents for its treatment will undoubtedly find more extensive use in other conditions.
